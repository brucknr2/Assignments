Abstract    :
                   This award will support the development of techniques for                 
              making in situ analyses of oxygen and sulfur isotopes in oxide,                
              silicate and sulfide minerals using fluorine gas and laser heating             
              for the liberation of oxygen and sulfur. The technique development             
              work will be carried out in the Geophysical Laboratory of the                  
              Carnegie Institution of Washington which will provide necessary                
              equipment as well as technical and scientific personnel for the                
              project.                                                                       
                   It is anticipated that the improved method of stable isotope              
              analysis will have application in a wide variety of investigations             
              where high-resolution, in situ, isotopic analyses are required                 
              including, for example, siliceous cements binding detrital grains              
              in sandstones, phenocrysts in plutonic and volcanic rocks, zoned               
              porphyroblasts in metamorphic rocks, and crustiform deposits of                
              sulfide, silicate, and oxide minerals in ore deposits.
