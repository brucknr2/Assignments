Abstract    :
                   This award will support a research program in the areas of                
              Markov processes, stochastic analysis, spatial point processes,                
              chains with infinite memory, large deviation theory, branching                 
              processes, and stochastic control.  Work on Markov processes will              
              focus on processes constrained to a subset of their natural state              
              space, measure-valued processes related to population genetics,                
              and models of stochastic networks.  A study of simulation and                  
              approximation methods for stochastic differential equations will               
              emphasize asymptotics for the error in approximation.  Work on                 
              large deviations will include both further theoretical                         
              developments and applications to simulation and hypothesis                     
              testing.  Applications of branching processes to problems arising              
              in fiber optic communication systems will be explored.                         
              Theoretical development for general stochastic control problems                
              will include approximation methodology and existence theorems for              
              Markov controls and optimal singular controls.  Applications of                
              stochastic control will focus on consumption models in the                     
              presence of mark imperfections.                                                
                   This award will support a research program in the areas of                
              Markov processes, stochastic analysis, spatial point processes,                
              and stochastic control.  This research falls within the area of                
              probability theory, but is motivated and will be applied to                    
              problems in a variety of fields:  population genetics,                         
              engineering, and finance.
