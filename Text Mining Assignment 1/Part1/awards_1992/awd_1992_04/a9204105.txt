Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The P.I. proposes to continue a U.S.-Russian collaborative project             
              (started in 1989) to study geochemical, tectonic, and structural               
              segmentations along the MAR between Hayes and Atlantis Transforms.             
              The Russian vessel Boris Petrov will be used for overall                       
              geophysical and bathymetric surveys and ALVIN will be used to                  
              sample ridge segments at shorter wavelength intrasegement scale.               
              The goal is to evaluate the petrogenetic processes (mantle source              
              variations, depth of melting, crystal fractionation, magma mixing              
              etc.) that are responsible for the observed geochemical and                    
              tectonic variations at all scales of ridge segmentation.
