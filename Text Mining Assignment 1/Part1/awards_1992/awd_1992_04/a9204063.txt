Abstract    :
              9204063  Chave  In this project, four principal investigators with support from 
              five separate institutions will study energy, momentum, and  vorticity budgets,
              and zonal volume and heat transport variability  in the Antarctic Circumpolar
              Current (ACC) south of Tasmania,  Australia.  A mix of moored current meters,
              seafloor electric field  recorders, and inverted echo sounders will be used in
              collaboration  with similar resources from scientists in Hobart, Tasmania.  in 
              this component, the PI will work with the University of Hawaii and  Scripps
              Institution of Oceanography to oversee the construction and  deployment of the
              Bottom Pressure gauges and seafloor Horizontal  Electric Field (HEF)
              instruments for determining barotropic current  variability.  ***
