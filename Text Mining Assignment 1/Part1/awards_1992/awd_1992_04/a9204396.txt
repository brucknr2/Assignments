Abstract    :
              This project will explore the synthetic potential of several                   
              important radical processes: the fragmentation of cyclopropyl                  
              and cyclobutylcarbinyl radicals; the generation, inversion and                 
              cyclization of dioxolanyl, oxiranyl, and aziridinyl radicals.                  
              These latter functionalized radicals can be generated from                     
              readily available chiral precursors that will lead to                          
              enantiomerically pure compounds.  Dioxolanyl, oxiranyl, and                    
              aziridinyl radicals have not been the subject of extensive                     
              study and in the case of the latter two, all but ignored as                    
              potential chiral reactants in chemical synthesis.  In addition                 
              to the synthetic potential of these processes, interesting                     
              mechanistic questions have also been posed.  The success of                    
              these studies will provide new avenues of synthesis that may be                
              applicable to the preparation of important antibiotics through                 
              pathways inaccessible by anionic and cationic methods.  Modern                 
              methods of chemical analysis, i.e., nuclear magnetic resonance                 
              and mass spectroscopy, will be used in the identification of                   
              the new materials prepared in this work.

              With this award, the Organic Synthesis Program will support the                
              research of Dr. Frederick E. Ziegler at Yale University.  The                  
              research explores new synthetic methodology based on free                      
              radical based reactions that could replace the more well                       
              developed anionic and cationic based methodology.
