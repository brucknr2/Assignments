Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The P.I.'s will continue the projects involving SIMS                           
              measurement of U-Th isotopes of oceanic basalts.  They have                    
              selected two ridge segments, one from EPR and th other from MAR,               
              with very different spreading rates for their study.  Whereas the              
              EPR segment is free of any hot spot or plume contamination, the MAR            
              segment chosen has been effected by the Azores plume.  The purpose             
              of the proposed research is to evaluate the effects of the melting             
              process (melt generation, magma transit times, fractional                      
              crystallization effects) and source characteristics using U-Th                 
              disequilibrium as a tool.
