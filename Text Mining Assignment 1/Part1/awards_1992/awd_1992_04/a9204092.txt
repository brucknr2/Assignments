Abstract    :
                   The principal investigators will study dynamical systems in               
              the classical case of the complex plane. One investigator will                 
              study the relationship between harmonic measure and analytic                   
              capacity. The other two investigators will continue their                      
              research on the moduli spaces associated with Kleinian groups and              
              Teichmuller theory. The research spans classical analysis in one               
              complex variable, group theory, and differential geometry.                     
                   This award will support research in the general area of                   
              dynamical systems. A process which is very simple and easy to                  
              understand locally can become extremely complicated, nonlinear,                
              and difficult to analyze globally. Dynamical systems is the study              
              of this local to global relationship. Many physical systems can                
              best be modeled using this area of mathematics including fluid                 
              flow and turbulence, complex biological systems, mechanical                    
              systems, and chemical reactions.
