Abstract    :
                   Ball will study geometric properties of metric spaces, in                 
              particular the Lp-spaces, which describe the rate at which random              
              walks in these spaces can wander.  He has shown that these                     
              properties are intimately connected with questions about                       
              factoring and extending Lipschitz maps.  The aim is to develop a               
              non-linear theory which parallels the powerful theory of type and              
              cotype in linear spaces.  Such a theory can be expected to have                
              numerous applications to the analysis of the various types of                  
              metric spaces which arise in all areas of mathematics.                         
                   Banach space theory is that part of mathematics that                      
              attempts to generalize to infinitely many dimensions the                       
              structure of 3-dimensional Euclidean (i.e.ordinary) space.  The                
              axioms for the distance function in a Banach space are more                    
              relaxed than those for Euclidean distance (For example, the                    
              "parallelogram law" is not required to hold.), and as a result,                
              the "geometry" of a Banach space can be quite exotic.  Much of                 
              the research in this area concerns studying the structure theory               
              of Banach spaces.
