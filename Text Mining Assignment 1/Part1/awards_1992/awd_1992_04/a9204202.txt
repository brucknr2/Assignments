Abstract    :
              The proposed work is on a number of fundamental problems in                    
              several areas of algorithm design and analysis.  Work in three                 
              areas is planned.                                                              
                                                                                             
                   o    Work on both limited and unlimited randomness is to                  
                        be continued on two fronts, new algorithms and                       
                        better tools for analyzing them.  The analytic tools                 
                        include better bounds for tail events, and                           
                        extensions of operator theory to analyze performance                 
                        in more difficult cases.                                             
                                                                                             
                   o    For suitably restricted classes, it should be                        
                        feasible to automate the generation of algorithms                    
                        problems for teaching, and to formulate very high                    
                        level languages that admit natural solutions and                     
                        support automated verification and refutation.                       
                        Research for this section is aimed at exploring the                  
                        fundamentals necessary to build a fledgling system                   
                        to support the learning of algorithmic concepts.                     
                                                                                             
                   o    While a rich variety of models for distributed                       
                        processing have been devised, and many algorithms                    
                        have been analyzed within these theoretical                          
                        frameworks, some large scale machines are being                      
                        built that run on different principles.  This work                   
                        is aimed at understanding such computation, which                    
                        might be called semi-synchronous.
