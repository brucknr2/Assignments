Abstract    :
                   Research efforts under this award lie in three areas:                     
              nonparametric and semiparametric estimation, stationary point                  
              processes and the history of twentieth century statistics.                     
              Specific goals for estimation of functionals in nonparametric                  
              models include a study of convergence rates for sieve estimators,              
              the construction of optimal or near-optimal estimators, and an                 
              examination of ways to reduce the dimensionality of the covariate              
              space.  The study of stationary point processes will examine                   
              methods of inference for these, also for stationary random sets                
              and for the prediction of areal averages of random fields.                     
                   One facet of this research involves the development of                    
              methods of accurate estimation based on complex data from the                  
              physical sciences.  These new methods should reduce the                        
              assumptions needed for the statistical analysis to proceed                     
              correctly.  The research will also investigate the effect of mild              
              errors in even those necessary assumptions.  A second aspect of                
              this project focusses on the analytic techniques for data                      
              gathered over wide areas, for example, measurements of                         
              atmospheric ozone.  The goal of this work is to develop                        
              statistical analytical methods which can be used to evaluate                   
              relationships among different measurements and to examine                      
              potential causal mechanisms.  The third aspect of this project is              
              the historical study of the relationship of the conceptual                     
              structure of mathematical theories to their areas of scientific                
              and policy applications.
