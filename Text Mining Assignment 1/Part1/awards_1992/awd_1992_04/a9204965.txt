Abstract    :
                      The variability of rainfall rate will be examined over a range         
              of time and space scales.  The principal topics of the proposed                
              research are the probability transformations of rainfall rate from             
              the plot scale, at which physical process representations can be               
              applied for land surface processes, to the observation scale of                
              climatological remote sensing systems, and from the observation                
              scale to the climate model scale.  A statistical model of raindrop             
              processes (Smith ?1991!) will be used to examine these                         
              transformations.  The model of raindrop processes yields a                     
              stochastic/dynamic representation of rainfall rate and provides a              
              unified framework for studying land surface processes related to               
              rainfall rate and atmospheric processes related to remote sensing              
              measurements of rainfall.  In this study, empirical and theoretical            
              analyses will be carried out for rainfall rate and raindrop                    
              processes.  The lognormal cascade theory of Gupta and Waymire                  
              ?1990! will play an important role in both empirical and                       
              theoretical scaling analyses.  Two principal problems will be                  
              examined:                                                                      
                                                                                             
                      *How do distributional properties of rainfall rate and                 
                      raindrop processes vary with scale?                                    
                      *How does rainfall rate depend on raindrop processes and how           
                      does this relationship vary with scale?                                
                                                                                             
              An important element of this project is development of statistical             
              procedures for assessing scale properties of rainfall and raindrop             
              processes.  The project will be an interdisciplinary effort                    
              involving hydrologists and statisticians.  The proposed research               
              will provide analytical tools for testing and refining the                     
              "probability distributed method" for representing land surface                 
              processes in climate models (Entekhabi and Eagleson ?1989!).                   
              Empirical studies will center on the southern plains regions of the            
              U.S. and utilize radar data, rain gage data and surface drop-size              
              data (including data from a network of disdrometers that will be               
              deployed for the 1992 STORM field experiment).  Surface drop-size              
              data from a number of climatic regions in the U.S. will also be                
              used for empirical studies.
