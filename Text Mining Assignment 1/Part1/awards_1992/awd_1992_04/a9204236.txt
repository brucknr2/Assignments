Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This Science in Developing Countries award will                                
              support an international workshop on Galeras                                   
              Volcanic Complex, Colombia, to be held in                                      
              Pasto, Colombia in August 1992.  Organizers are                                
              Stanley Williams and Marta Lucia Calvache V. of                                
              Arizona State University and Jaime Romero L. of                                
              the Observatorio Volcanologico de Colombia-Sur                                 
              in Pasto, Colombia.                                                            
                                                                                             
              The workshop aims to synthesize state-of-the-                                  
              art knowledge concerning Galeras, produce a                                    
              preliminary working model of the volcanic                                      
              system, and plan future research collaboration.                                
              During the last three years, seismic activity                                  
              at Galeras has increased significantly.  The                                   
              researchers' prior work on the volcano's recent                                
              geology suggests that an explosive eruption is                                 
              likely.  In this workshop, participants will                                   
              design new dimensions to ongoing research                                      
              programs at Galeras and try to mitigate                                        
              potential hazards by increasing basic knowledge                                
              before a disaster.  If the eruption occurs                                     
              before the workshop, the organizers will use it                                
              to integrate results and direct continuing                                     
              research.  Both the U.S. and Latin American                                    
              participants will benefit from a timely                                        
              exchange of information and from the                                           
              opportunity to develop future collaborative                                    
              projects.
