Abstract    :
              In this Experimental Physical Chemistry project funded by the                  
              Division of Chemistry, Prof. Coe (Ohio State University) will                  
              build a novel apparatus in which a molecular beam of positively                
              charged, solvated ions is gently merged with a similar beam of                 
              negatively charged ions. Recombination will be monitored by                    
              detecting fast moving neutral products. This will permit                       
              production of solvent-separated ion pair clusters, and will                    
              lead to elucidation of step-wise solvation energies of strong                  
              electrolytes.%%%                                                               
              Reactions of charged species in solution lie at the heart of                   
              many chemical reactions, but very little hard information has                  
              been available about the detailed role of intervening solvent                  
              in influencing the course of the reaction. Prof. Coe (Ohio                     
              State University) will address this question by building an                    
              apparatus which will make it possible for the first time to                    
              determine how many solvent molecules there must be around the                  
              reacting species in order to keep positively charged materials                 
              from reacting immediately with negatively charged species. This                
              will help to answer the more general question of how many                      
              molecules are needed to define what chemists mean by a solution                
              of one substance in another.
