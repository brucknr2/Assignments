              This award form the U.S.-Brazil Cooperative                                    
              Science Program will support collaborative                                     
              research in atmospheric sciences to be carried                                 
              out by Dr. George F. Smoot of the University of                                
              California, Berkeley and Dr. Thyrso Villela of                                 
              the Instituto Nacional Pesquisas Espaciais                                     
              (INPE) at San Jose dos Campos, Brazil.  The                                    
              project will map the southern sky as part of a                                 
              program to make high quality maps of galactic                                  
              emission.                                                                      
                                                                                             
              This collaboration combines the acknowledged                                   
              expertise of he Berkeley group in studying                                     
              cosmic background emission with the access to                                  
              territory and high gain equipment afforded by                                  
              the Brazilian side.  The project will make                                     
              spectral measurements of the differential and                                  
              absolute sky brightness over the 400 to 1000                                   
              MHz range first with 15 to 10 degree angular                                   
              resolution and then at higher resolution. These                                
              measurements will study the spectrum of                                        
              galactic, extragalactic and cosmic radiation.                                  
              The study will provide the basis for the next                                  
              generation of high-precision measurements of                                   
              the very low-frequency spectrum of the cosmic                                  
              microwave background radiation (CMBR) and allow                                
              the reinterpretation of low-frequency CMBR                                     
              spectrum measurements made over the past                                       
              decade. ***//
