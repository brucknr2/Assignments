Abstract    :
              This award is made by the Office of Special Projects in the                    
              Chemistry Division under the Materials Synthesis and Processing                
              Initiative. This research will optimize the photochemical                      
              generation of phenoxy free radicals with regard to the type of                 
              substitution and the irradiation wavelength employed and apply                 
              the methodology to study electron exchange-controlled magnetic                 
              interactions in both molecular and polymeric systems. Solid                    
              state stable phenoxy polyradical systems will also be prepared                 
              and magnetic interactions in the solid state will be determined                
              using spectroscopic and magnetic susceptibility techniques.

              These fundamental structural and mechanistic investigations are                
              directed towards developing rules to describe magnetic                         
              interactions both within and between molecules which may permit                
              the design of a new generation of bulk organic ferromagnets.
