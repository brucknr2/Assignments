Abstract    :
                   Theoretical research at the interface of elementary                       
              particle physics and cosmology will focus on how physical                      
              processes that took place early in the evolution of the                        
              Universe can help us understand both the fundamental structure                 
              of matter and its interactions, and the large-scale structure                  
              of the Universe.                                                               
                   The methods to be used consist of analytical tools from                   
              theoretical particle physics and large-scale computer                          
              simulations of non-linear field theories, designed to model                    
              the dynamics of phase transitions and spontaneous symmetry                     
              breaking in an expanding Universe.  Applications to the                        
              construction of models of particle interactions and to the                     
              impact of phase transitions on cosmology will be analyzed in                   
              detail.                                                                        
                   It is expected that the results obtained by this research                 
              activity will help clarify many of the complex issues that                     
              arise when one examines some of the fundamental problems of                    
              particle physics and cosmology, such as the excess of matter                   
              over antimatter in the Universe, as well as the origin of its                  
              rich large-scale structure.
