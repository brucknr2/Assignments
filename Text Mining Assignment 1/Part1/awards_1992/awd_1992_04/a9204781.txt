Abstract    :
                     This study of real-time deformation of mineral analogues is             
              designed to provide further insight on the grain-scale processes               
              that occur when rocks are deformed.  The materials to be used are              
              ammonium thiocyanate, cobalt chloride thiocyanate and ammonium                 
              chloride in a water-rich melt.  Thin sections of these materials               
              will be deformed between glass slides and observed with a petro-               
              graphic microscope as they deform.  The experiment will give                   
              information on grain boundary migration and crystallization                    
              behavior during deformation of crystals in a melt phase, and will              
              have immediate application to studies of syntectonic plutons.  The             
              results will have wide implication for tectonic processes in                   
              orogenic belts that contain coeval plutonic rocks.
