Abstract    :
              The influence of elastic stress on the thermodynamic (equilibrium              
              and kinetic) behavior of single phase and multiphase,                          
              multicomponent crystalline solids is examined.  The proposed                   
              research includes theoretical analyses and experimental approaches             
              to the problem. There are two thrusts in the proposal: (1) the                 
              development of a general paradigm for the treatment of phase                   
              equilibria, including equilibrium phase conditions, phase                      
              coexistence and phase diagram construction in homogeneously                    
              stressed and heterogeneously stressed systems; (2) the effect of               
              stress on material response to imposed gradients in such                       
              thermodynamic potentials as the temperature, chemical activity,                
              electric field and deformation (stress or strain).                             
              %%%                                                                            
              Although most crystalline materials are subjected to various                   
              potential gradients in practice, little is known on how elastic                
              stress affects material behavior in such circumstances.  Elastic               
              stresses can arise from internal sources such as composition                   
              gradients and coherency strains between phases or from external                
              sources such as applied load.
