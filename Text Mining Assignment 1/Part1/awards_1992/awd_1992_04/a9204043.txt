Abstract    :
              This U.S-Venezuela award will support Professor Cora                           
              Sadosky of Howard University in a research                                     
              collaboration with Professor Mischa Cotlar of the                              
              Universidad Central de Venezuela.  The researchers                             
              intend to work on problems of approximation and                                
              interpolation of functions in several complex                                  
              variables.  The approach will focus on their recent                            
              extensions of classical techniques involving                                   
              approximation and interpolation of functions in the                            
              one-dimensional case to many dimensions.                                       
                                                                                             
              The proposed work continues a collaboration started                            
              several years ago that has produced more than twenty                           
              papers and presentations in several international                              
              meetings.  In addition, it has potential                                       
              applicability to various fields of science and                                 
              engineering, for example electrical engineering and                            
              geophysics.
