Abstract    :
                   The principal investigators will study several problems in                
              global Riemannian geometry related to the existence,                           
              classification, and degeneration of compact Riemannian manifolds               
              which are extremal for an integral norm of the curvature. They                 
              will also study applications of this theory to Kahler geometry,                
              differential topology, and mathematical physics. One principal                 
              investigator will study the existence of degenerate solutions to               
              the critical metric problem. The second principal investigator                 
              will study the holonomy of complete manifolds of positive scalar               
              curvature.                                                                     
                   This award will support research in the general area of                   
              differential geometry and global analysis. Differential geometry               
              is the study of the relationship between the geometry of a space               
              and analytic concepts defined on the space. Global analysis is                 
              the study of the overall geometric and topological properties of               
              a space by piecing together local information. Applications of                 
              these areas of mathematics in other sciences include the                       
              structure of complicated molecules, liquid-gas boundaries, and                 
              the large scale structure of the universe.
