Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Research will be performed on fundamental and relevant problems in             
              the areas of cosmology and galaxy formation.  Emphasis will be                 
              placed on improving models for the global star formation rate in               
              disk galaxies and developing this approach to be applicable to the             
              early evolution of disks and to protogalaxies.  This will enable               
              one to predict their luminosity, spectral and chemical evolution.              
              A second investigation will be of the angular anisotropy of the                
              cosmic microwave background radiation in open cosmological models.             
              Small deviations from anisotropy are inevitable and probe the                  
              origin of the large-scale structure in the Universe; detailed                  
              predictions are necessary to compare with experiments.                         
                                                                                             
              The Principal Investigator is recognized as one of the world                   
              leaders in theoretical cosmology and extragalactic astronomy.
