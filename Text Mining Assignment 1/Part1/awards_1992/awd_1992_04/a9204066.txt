Abstract    :
              Ni         This research project studies multicast communication, in  which the
              same data packet is delivered from a source node to an  arbitrary number of
              destination nodes.  The project explores  architectural support for multicast
              as well as software support  for use in systems that do not provide
              architectural support.
