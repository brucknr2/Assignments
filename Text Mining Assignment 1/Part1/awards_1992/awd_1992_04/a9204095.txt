Abstract    :
                   The principal investigator will study harmonic maps on a                  
              compact Riemannian manifold which is either Kahler or Riemannian               
              locally symmetric. He will attempt to obtain new Bochner                       
              identities to prove geometric rigidity theorems in optimal for                 
              quotients of Riemannian symmetric manifolds of rank greater than               
              one. His methods are different than standard methods in the line               
              of research since he does not require that the manifolds under                 
              consideration be folliated by bounded symmetric domains.                       
                   This award will support research in the general area of                   
              differential geometry and global analysis. Differential geometry               
              is the study of the relationship between the geometry of a space               
              and analytic concepts defined on the space. Global analysis is                 
              the study of the overall geometric and topological properties of               
              a space by piecing together local information. Applications of                 
              these areas of mathematics in other sciences include the                       
              structure of complicated molecules, liquid-gas boundaries, and                 
              the large scale structure of the universe.
