Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                                                                                            
              We are requesting funds for support for the 25th Annual Meeting                
              of the Northwest Regional Development Biology Conference to be                 
              held April 29- May 2, 1992 in the conference facilities at the                 
              Friday Harbor Laboratories of the University of Washington (San                
              Juan Island, Washington).  The funds requested here will be used               
              exclusively (a) to pay for travel expenses, room and board for                 
              the five invited speakers, and (b) to lower the cost of room and               
              board for the estimated 55-75 graduate students expected to                    
              attend the conference.
