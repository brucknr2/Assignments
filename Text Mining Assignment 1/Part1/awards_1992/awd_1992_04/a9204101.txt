Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                                                                                            
              The problem of intermittent demand interferes with efficient                   
              production and inventory control activities in US manufacturing                
              firms.  While the key role of accurate and timely demand                       
              forecasting in planning production, inventories and work force,                
              and economic lot sizing has received considerable attention, the               
              vast majority of forecasting research, and nearly all commercial               
              forecasting software, assume that demand is "smooth" rather than               
              intermittent.  Results of the Phase I Small Business Innovation                
              Research (SBIR) study establish the technical basis for a new                  
              software tool that can be used to forecast intermittent demand                 
              and that is suitable for use on a desktop computer.  The                       
              objectives of the Phase II research focus on (1) gathering and                 
              analysis of more real-world intermittent time-series data; (2)                 
              implementation of a single-series method of Croston's for                      
              forecasting intermittent demand, including its extension to                    
              trending and seasonal data; (3) development of a new multi-                    
              series  forecasting approach based on stochastic process models                
              that "borrow strength" across the items in a product line; (4)                 
              determination of the most effective use of sales-force judgments               
              of intermittent demand, including their combination with                       
              statistical forecasts' and (5) integration of the forecasting                  
              methods developed in Phase II, culminating in their                            
              implementation in a software prototype running on desktop                      
              computers.                                                                     
                                                                                             
              The project will provide a computerized state-of-the-art solution              
              to the intermittent demand forecasting problem.  A large                       
              percentage of US manufacturing firms stand to benefit from more                
              efficient production made possible by such demand forecasting.
