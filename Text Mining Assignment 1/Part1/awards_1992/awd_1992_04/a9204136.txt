Abstract    :
              In this project in the Physical Chemistry Program of the                       
              Chemistry Division, Professors Allison and Leroi will study                    
              the matrix isolation infrared spectroscopy of mass-selected                    
              ions.  Based on early promising experiments carried out under                  
              their previous grant, these researchers will develop a new                     
              methodology via laser-induced fluorescence and Fourier                         
              transform infrared spectroscopy of small cations in neon                       
              matrices at 4 K.  Structural analysis of both organic and                      
              organometallic cations, co-deposited with counter ions, will                   
              be demonstrated.  Complementary theoretical calculations of                    
              ionic structures and vibrational frequencies will also be                      
              carried out.  The goals of this work are to provide a new tool                 
              for the structural characterization of molecular ions as well                  
              as to probe the structure/function relationships governing                     
              organometallic chemistry.                                                      
              %%%                                                                            
              The collaborating principal investigators have designed and                    
              constructed a unique instrument which is a marriage of two                     
              completely different types of spectroscopy, one which                          
              separates different ions according to their masses, the other                  
              which measures the characteristic absorption or emission of                    
              light by molecules or ions.  This technique should aid in the                  
              determination of the molecular structures of transient species                 
              as well as in the elucidation of mechanisms of ion-molecule                    
              reactions which are important to many areas of atmospheric,                    
              environmental, and materials sciences.
