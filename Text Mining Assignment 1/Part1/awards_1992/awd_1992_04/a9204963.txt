Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This U.S.-Bulgaria research project between Dr.                                
              Widen Tabakoff and Dr. Awatef Hamid of the                                     
              University of Cincinnati and Dr. Vesselin Shanov                               
              of the Technical University of Sofia, Bulgaria,                                
              will perform complementary research tasks at                                   
              their laboratories related to new temperature                                  
              materials which are resistant to erosion.                                      
              Professor Shanov from the Technical University of                              
              Sofia will develop high temperature erosion                                    
              resistant ceramic coatings which will be further                               
              investigated at the University of Cincinnati in                                
              regard to erosion and surface impacts when the                                 
              new coatings are exposed to high temperature                                   
              particulate flows.  The proposed cooperative                                   
              research project involves the collaboration of                                 
              the two teams in conducting complementary                                      
              research tasks which will enhance the knowledge                                
              derived from their research efforts, and will                                  
              produce new results that will benefit the                                      
              scientific community in the critical area of                                   
              erosion and high temperature materials.                                        
                                                                                             
              This project in aerospace and engineering                                      
              metallurgy fulfills the program objective of                                   
              advancing scientific knowledge by enabling                                     
              leading experts in the United States and Eastern                               
              Europe to combine complementary talents and pool                               
              resources in areas of strong mutual interest and                               
              competence.
