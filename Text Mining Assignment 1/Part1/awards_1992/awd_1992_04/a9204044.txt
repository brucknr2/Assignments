Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              In Phase I it was discovered that zeolite membranes can be                     
              synthesized using silicone polymers as a silicone polymers as                  
              a silica source.  Polymer chains are incorporated into the                     
              growing zeolite crystals to give a zeolite film of interlocked                 
              crystals.  Initial work was with water insoluble solid                         
              silicones, which gave a process involving three phases                         
              (polymer, solution and zeolite).  No successful preparation of                 
              self-supporting zeolite membranes has been reported previously                 
              in the literature.                                                             
                                                                                             
              In Phase II it is proposed to simplify the synthetic process                   
              by using a water soluble silicone.  Commercially available                     
              silicones will be evaluated as well as synthesizing silicones                  
              to optimize parameters, such as average molecular weight,                      
              water solubility, rate of conversion to zeolite, and physical                  
              properties of the zeolite membranes.  Elements such as boron,                  
              aluminum and titanium will be added to the silicones so that                   
              they will become part of the zeolite framework, giving the                     
              zeolite uniquely valuable properties.  The zeolite membranes                   
              prepared will be evaluated for separation (N2/O2 and                           
              ethanol/water) and catalytic (xylene isomerization and fuel                    
              cells) applications.  The availability of zeolite membranes                    
              with molecular sized pores and catalytic sites opens many more                 
              opportunities than can possibly be studied in a single                         
              project.  These include lower separations costs, purification                  
              of polluted air and water, and new catalytic processes.
