Abstract    :
              This workshop is to be held in conjunction with the 1992                       
              International Symposium on Symbolic and Algebraic                              
              Computation in July of l992, at the University of                              
              California, Berkeley.  The area of integrated                                  
              symbolic-numeric computing is an emerging discipline                           
              which combines these methods for scientific and                                
              engineering problem solving.  In addition, high                                
              performance computing environments shall be considered.
