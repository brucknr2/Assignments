Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This program explores containerless liquid phase processing of                 
              ceramics, superconductors, and metals.  The process itself is                  
              referred to as "AAL", or aero-acoustic levitation.  A CO2 laser                
              heats the particle up to 2700 degrees C.  Phase I demonstrated the             
              AAL process for ceramic and glass.  The work in Phase II has three             
              parts: (1) characterization of the levitator process; (2)                      
              automation of the processing of materials: (3) collaborative                   
              research.  These steps are required to apply AAL to materials of               
              interest, prepare quantities of materials, and evaluate the                    
              processed materials.                                                           
              %%%                                                                            
              Promising applications of the AAL process involve the production of            
              high value-added materials with commercial potential.  New methods             
              for crystal, fiber, and non-equilibrium synthesis should be                    
              possible.
