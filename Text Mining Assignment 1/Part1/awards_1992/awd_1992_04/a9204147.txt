Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The primary objectives of this research is to:  (a) study                      
              femtosecond real-time dynamics in clusters, (b) examine molecular              
              interactions under high pressures, and (c) develop techniques for              
              probing the primary processes, involving coherence and relaxation,             
              in complex systems.  The ultimate goal is to learn about forces                
              governing the transition to the condensed phase limit.
