Abstract    :
              A Symposium entitled "The biochemistry and Molecular Biology of                
              Beta-Glucosidases" has been organized and will be held in                      
              conjunction with the Annual Meeting of the American Chemical                   
              Society in Washington, D.C., August 23-28, 1992.  The symposium                
              will include three sessions and will last one and one half                     
              days.  Eighteen leading research have been invited to review                   
              their past and present their current research on the Beta-                     
              glucosidase they are studying.  Topics will include (1) the                    
              purification and characterization of Beta-glucosidases from                    
              plants, humans, insects, fungi, and bacteria; (2) the mechanism                
              of catalysis: (3) isolation, characterization, and manipulation                
              of Beta-glucosidase genes: and (4) use of Beta-glucosidases for                
              biomass conversion in industry.  Symposium papers will be                      
              collected into a book to be published by the American Chemical                 
              Society Books Department.

              Current research on Beta glucosidases has significant                          
              scientific and economic implications.  Plant enzymes are                       
              implicated in growth productivity, food and feed toxicities,                   
              fungal and bacterial enzymes could be used in the industrial                   
              conversion of cellulose to glucose; and human enzyme deficiency                
              is the cause of Gaucher's disease.
