Abstract    :
                   The principal investigators will study problems of                        
              stabilization and optimal control of linear partial differential               
              equations.  These problems are physically meaningful and are                   
              mathematically relevant.  They also will examine extensions of                 
              existing stabilization results to cover mildly nonlinear systems.              
                   Control theory deals with the theoretical aspects of                      
              understanding how complex systems modelled as algebraic or                     
              differential systems learn about its environment, process the                  
              information to reduce uncertainty, plan, generate and execute                  
              control actions.  It has played a major role in many areas of                  
              science and engineering.
