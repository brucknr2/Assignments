Abstract    :
                     Southeast Asia provides a modern example of accretion of                
              oceanic arcs and islands onto a craton.  This project involves                 
              paleomagnetic investigation of two areas to clarify interpretation             
              of Tertiary tectonics involving rotations and translations.                    
              Volcanic samples from Myanmar will allow testing of mechanism of               
              generation of the observed rotations in Myanmar, Thailand and                  
              Peninsular Malaysia.  The project will also test the hypothesis                
              that Mindanao has recently accreted to the Philippines from the                
              Philippine Sea Plate.  Results will add to the understanding of the            
              processes of collision and accretion of oceanic blocks against                 
              continents.
