Abstract    :
                   This project involves three components:  i) a study of the                
              mathematical aspects of discrete or continuous models of highly                
              distorted conductors,  ii)  an investigation of the mechanical                 
              properties of guasiperiodic media, and iii) the computation of                 
              bounds on mechanical properties of composite materials.                        
                   The project addresses some challenging mathematical                       
              questions concerning models of heterogenous materials, such as                 
              those of composites, semiconductors, superconducting composites,               
              porous media, and modulated structures.
