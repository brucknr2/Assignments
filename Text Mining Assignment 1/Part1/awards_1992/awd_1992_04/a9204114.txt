Abstract    :
              This project is an experimental study of scientifically and                    
              technologically important point defects in elemental and compound              
              semiconductors using optical detection of magnetic resonance and               
              optical detection of electron-nuclear double resonance.  Some of               
              the defects are produced by electron irradiation of Zinc-Tellurium             
              samples at low temperatures.  Another part of the work deals with              
              metastable defects, such as DX and EL2 centers, in II-VI and III-V             
              semiconductors.  Other materials being studied are fullerenes, MBE             
              nitrogen-doped Zinc-Selenium and porous silicon.
