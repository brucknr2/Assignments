Abstract    :
                   Our previous study of the paleoenvironments of the                        
              southwestern margin of the Cretaceous Western Interior Seaway used             
              a joint investigation of clay minerals and foraminifera to yield               
              some new ideas on the interaction of sedimentation, tectonics,                 
              climate and oceanography on a regional scale.  Specifically, we                
              have been able to discriminate between eustatic and climatic                   
              influences on sediment distribution during the Late Cretaceous, and            
              we have correlated changes in source area and circulation patterns             
              to foraminiferal populations.  In this study, we intend to expand              
              the scope of our scrutiny to more rigorously evaluate short-term               
              changes in depositional conditions, water-column stratification,               
              and the development of oxygen-minimum zones at a proximal basin                
              locality spanning the upper Cenomanian to basal Campanian (Mesa                
              Verde, CO).  The principal methods to be used will be sedimentary              
              geochemistry (Fe, Mn, S, CaCO3, TOC and Rock-Eval pyrolysis)                   
              coupled with foraminiferal population and shape studies, and                   
              integrated into the detailed stratigraphy gathered previously                  
              during two field seasons.  Moreover, we will correlate the                     
              environments at this site to those at a neritic basin site (Lohali             
              Point, AZ) further west where we have a detailed section from the              
              Cenomanian to the upper Turonian.  This will provide us with the               
              basis for comparing conditions in this nearshore locale with those             
              that have been documented for distal basin sites to the east, (such            
              as at Pueblo, CO) and will enable us to reconstruct the                        
              comprehensive paleoceanography of this southwestern sector of the              
              Western Interior Seaway.
