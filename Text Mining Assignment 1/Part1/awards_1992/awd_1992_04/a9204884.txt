Abstract    :
                   This pilot project will attempt obtain precise radiometric                
              ages from critical levels to of an Ocean Drilling Program drill                
              core (site 758).  Feldspar mineral grains will be separated from               
              18 different volcanic tephra layers and then subjected to analysis             
              using the laser 40Ar/39Ar dating technique.  This method has                   
              unprecedented sensitivity and precision, and if suitable material              
              can be extracted from these volcanic horizons, ages with accuracies            
              to within a few thousand years can be obtained.  Since this core               
              been studied using oxygen isotopic and paleomagnetic methods, the              
              time-scale derived could precisely calibrate the entire magnetic               
              and global climate change chronology over the past 5 million years.            
              Divergences between the theoretically expected periodicities of                
              oxygen isotope ratio variations and the standard magnetic reversal             
              time scale have raised serious questions about its accuracy.  Laser            
              40Ar/39Ar dating has probably the greatest potential for resolving             
              these questions.  However, the project is 'high-risk' in the sense             
              that is not yet known if sufficient datable material can be                    
              obtained from ODP cores.  If successful, this project could not                
              only improve the currently accepted time scale of global climatic              
              change, it also has the potential for being able to estimate the               
              response rate of the earth to the now well-established astronomical            
              inputs to the earth's climate system.
