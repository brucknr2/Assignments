Abstract    :
                   The principal investigators will continue work on various                 
              areas of differential geometry including large time heat flow on               
              Riemannian manifolds and Teichmuller space. The work on heat flow              
              will use method from probability to attempt to describe the                    
              relationship between heat diffusion and geometric quantities. One              
              of the investigators will also study discrete versions of some                 
              problems in spectral theory. The research on Teichmuller theory                
              will focus on applications of the theory to dynamical systems.                 
              The principal investigators will also attempt to develop a                     
              Teichmuller theory for quadratic and polynomial-like maps.                     
                   This award will support research in the general area of                   
              differential geometry and global analysis. Differential geometry               
              is the study of the relationship between the geometry of a space               
              and analytic concepts defined on the space. Global analysis is                 
              the study of the overall geometric and topological properties of               
              a space by piecing together local information. Applications of                 
              these areas of mathematics in other sciences include the                       
              structure of complicated molecules, liquid-gas boundaries, and                 
              the large scale structure of the universe.
