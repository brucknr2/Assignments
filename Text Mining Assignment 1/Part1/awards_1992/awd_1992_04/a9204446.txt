Abstract    :
                   This award provides one-half the funding needed to acquire a              
              modern image analysis system to be installed and operated in the               
              Department of Geological Sciences at the University of Oregon. The             
              University is committed to providing the remaining funds necessary             
              for this acquisition.                                                          
                   Interpretation of the textures of igneous, metamorphic and                
              sedimentary rocks in order to better understand the processes which            
              formed them requires the application of recently developed                     
              quantitative image analysis techniques.
