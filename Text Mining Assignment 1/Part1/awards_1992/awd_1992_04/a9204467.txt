Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Technical Narrative:                                                           
              This proposal requests renewal of a previously                                 
              approved and active research project "INDO-US                                  
              Collaborative Research on Novel Oxide Materials."                              
              The collaborators are C.N.R. Rao, Professor, Solid                             
              State and Structural Chemistry Unit, Indian                                    
              Institute of Science, Bangalore, and J.M. Honig,                               
              Materials Research Center, Purdue University.  The                             
              research will continue development of novel oxide                              
              materials with special attention to high temperature                           
              superconductors.  The research includes synthesis of                           
              interesting oxide systems and examination of                                   
              structure-property relations. Included are selected                            
              studies of high Tc 214-oxide superconductors with                              
              the K2NiF4 structure and related normal properties                             
              of this class of materials.                                                    
                                                                                             
              Scope:                                                                         
              The collaboration of Professor Rao's team at                                   
              Bangalore and Professor Honig's team at Purdue has                             
              been successful and resulted in a number of                                    
              significant publications.  Rao is one of India's                               
              most distinguished scientists.  He has done                                    
              pioneering research in numerous areas of materials                             
              and structural chemistry.  It is likely that this                              
              project will result in significant advances in                                 
              the field of new materials and better material                                 
              characterization.  Dr. Honig is a participant in a                             
              newly established Indiana Center for Innovative                                
              Superconductivity Technology, which was provided                               
              $500,000 for the first year of operation by the                                
              State of Indiana.  His work with Dr. Rao would fit                             
              well with the objectives of that center, and with                              
              enhancing materials science research in the U.S.
