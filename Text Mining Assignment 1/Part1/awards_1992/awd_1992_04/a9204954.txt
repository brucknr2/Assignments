Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Requesting funding for a one-day symposium on "Respiratory and                 
              Ionic Aspects of Acid-Base Regulation in Insects" to be held at the            
              American Society of Zoologists 1992 meeting in Vancouver, with the             
              proceedings to be published in American Zoologist.  This will be               
              the first symposium held on insect acid-base regulation, and will              
              unite researchers from a diversity of fields in an emerging area               
              of physiology.  The symposium will use a multidisciplinary approach            
              to consider: (1) variation in acid-base epithelial transport                   
              mechanisms and their hormonal control among insect tissues, (2)                
              variation in acid-base epithelial transport mechanisms among                   
              insects living in aquatic and terrestrial environments, (3)                    
              contributions of metabolism and nitrogen excretion to acid-base                
              regulation, (4) biomechanics and control of ventilatory carbon                 
              dioxide release, (5) acid base effects of discontinous ventilatory             
              release of carbon dioxide, and (6) the integration of acid-base                
              regulation with other physiological processes.  This comparative               
              approach will aid in the development a integrated model of insect              
              acid-base regulation.
