Abstract    :
              Seed germination is a critical phase of the plant life cycle, both             
              ecologically and agriculturally, and is sensitive to both                      
              endogenous hormones and environmental factors.  A quantitative                 
              mathematical model has been developed to characterize the responses            
              of seed germination to abscisic acid (ABA), gibberellins (GA), and             
              water potential (psi).  Single-gene mutations in tomato                        
              (Lycopersicon esculentum Mill.) resulting in deficiencies of ABA               
              or GA have contrasting effects on dormancy, germination rates, and             
              sensitivity to reduced psi.  This project will utilize these mutant            
              genotypes within the framework provided by the mathematical model              
              to identify the biochemical processes controlling germination.                 
              Germination occurs when endosperm cell layers opposite the radicle             
              tip weaken and separate to allow embryo expansion.  Cell wall                  
              hydrolysis in this endosperm tissue and its relationship to                    
              germination rates will be investigated.  The composition of tomato             
              endosperm cell walls will be characterized, the substrates,                    
              products, and enzymes involved in cell wall hydrolysis will be                 
              identified, and the relationship of cell wall hydrolysis to tissue             
              weakening will be critically analyzed in mutant and wild-type                  
              seeds.  Extending the mathematical description of seed germination             
              to the physiological and biochemical levels provides a powerful new            
              method for studying the integration of regulatory controls in plant            
              development.
