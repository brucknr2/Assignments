Abstract    :
              The principal investigators will study high-grade metamorphic rocks            
              in the People's Republic of China in collaboration with scientists             
              from the University of California at Santa Barbara, the Academia               
              Sinica of Peking University and the Provincial Bureau of Geology               
              and Mineral Resources from Hubei and Anhui. The objectives are to              
              map several metamorphic belts in central China, to thoroughly study            
              the mineralogy of the high-pressure rocks there, to delineate                  
              mineral parageneses and the pressure-temperature-time paths of the             
              rocks, to establish geologic ages for the several critical rock                
              units, and to relate these to igneous and tectonic features. The               
              study will lead to a better understanding of how continental crust             
              was subducted to mantle depths, and later exhumed.
