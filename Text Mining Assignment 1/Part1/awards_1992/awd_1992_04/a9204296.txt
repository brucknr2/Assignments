Abstract    :
                   Professor Prasad will work on arithmetic, geometric and                   
              group theoretic questions related to semi-simple groups over                   
              local and global fields.  He intends to work on the congruence                 
              subgroup problem for anisotropic semi-simple groups over global                
              function fields. He also intends to study principal bundles over               
              certain smooth varieties.                                                      
                   This project falls into the general area of arithmetic                    
              geometry - a subject that blends two of the oldest areas of                    
              mathematics: number theory and geometry.  This combination has                 
              proved extraordinarily fruitful - having recently solved problems              
              that withstood generations.  Among its many consequences are new               
              error correcting codes.  Such codes are essential for both modern              
              computers (hard disks) and compact disks.
