Abstract    :
              Phosphatidate (PA) phosphatase (3-sn-phosphatidate                             
              phosphohydrolase, EC 3.1.3.4) in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae            
              catalyzes the dephosphorylation of PA to form diacylglycerol and Pi.           
              PA phsophatase plays a role in the regulation of phospholipid and              
              triacylglycerol synthesis in S. cerevisiae.  Two membrane-                     
              associated forms (45-kDa and 104-kDa) of PA phosphatase have been              
              purified and characterized in our laboratory.  In this grant                   
              application we propose to initiate a project to clone the                      
              structural genes for the 45-kDa and 104-kDa forms of PA                        
              phosphatase.  We will use specific antibodies to the enzymes and               
              lambda-ZAP cDNA expression and lambda-DASH genomic expression                  
              libraries.  The cloned genes will be characterized and the                     
              essential nature of PA phosphatase will be addressed.

              The enzyme phosphatidate (PA) phosphatase in the yeast                         
              Saccharomyces cerevisiae catalyzes the removal of phosphate from               
              the phospholipid PA to form the neutral lipid diacylglycerol.  This            
              enzyme plays a role in the control of overall lipid synthesis in               
              yeast and in animal cells.  Two membrane-associated forms (45-kDa              
              and 104-kDa) of PA phosphatase have been purified and characterized            
              in our laboratory.  In this grant application we propose to                    
              initiate a project to isolate the genes which encode for the 45-kDa            
              and 104-kDa forms of PA phosphatase.  We will use specific                     
              antibodies to the enzymes and DNA expression libraries in lambda               
              viruses.  Once isolated the genes for these enzymes will be                    
              characterized.  The essential nature and role of these genes in                
              yeast lipid synthesis and cell growth will be examined.
