Abstract    :
              The prime goal of this research is to understand the performance               
              characteristics of fundamental algorithms that are likely to be broadly        
              applicable.  Considerations include analytic techniques that can result        
              in precise performance predictions and essential characteristics of            
              specific implementations and their likely impact in practical                  
              applications.  A goal is to be able to make intelligent choices among          
              existing algorithms for the same task and to have a reasonable basis for       
              developing new, better algorithms.                                             
                                                                                             
              Visual presentations of information can be an important tool in the            
              study of algorithms.  The emphasis in this project is on exploiting            
              recent developments in printing technology to enable the design of             
              information-rich visual representations that can effectively exhibit           
              essential properties of algorithms, and on using such representations as       
              an integral part of an ongoing research program in the design and              
              analysis of combinatorial algorithms.//
