Abstract    :
                   This award provides 67% of the funds needed to acquire                    
              research-grade petrographic microscopes for the Department of                  
              Geological Sciences at the State University of New York in                     
              Binghamton. The University is committed to providing the remaining             
              33% required for this acquisition.                                             
                   The microscopes will be used initially by faculty and graduate            
              students in the Department of Geological Sciences who are involved             
              in research on the study of evaporite cores from Death Valley,                 
              Saline Valley, and Bristol Dry Lake, California as indicators of               
              past climate changes.
