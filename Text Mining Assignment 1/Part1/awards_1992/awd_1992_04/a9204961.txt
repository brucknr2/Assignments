Abstract    :
              The purpose of this study is to determine how much isotopic                    
              variability in basalts arises in the mantle, and how much is a                 
              result of crustal interaction.  It will consist of (1) an isotopic             
              survey of upper mantle and crustal basalt-borne xenoliths, (2)                 
              detailed geochemical studies at volcanoes that show large                      
              variability in isotope ratios, (3) textural and microprobe studies             
              of textural disequilibrium, in order to test for the mixing                    
              predicted by isotope studies, and (4) experimental studies of                  
              interaction between basalt magma and crustal mantle xenoliths.  A              
              successful outcome of this research should shed considerable light             
              on the chemical nature of the mantle of the southwest United                   
              States.
