Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The long-term objective of our research is the elucidation of the              
              molecular pathways which function in thyroid hormone (T3)                      
              regulation of Na, K-ATPase subunit genes. In our research to-date,             
              chimeric genes consisting of a portion of the 5'-flanking region               
              of alpha2 and alpha3 subunit genes ligated to the coding region of             
              the firefly luciferase gene have been utilized to transiently                  
              transfect neonatal cardiac myocytes. Surprisingly, we find that the            
              expression of both alpha2 and alpha3 chimeric genes is                         
              significantly repressed by T3 in the presence of co-transfected T3             
              receptor. These observations are consistent with a preliminary                 
              finding of T3-mediated repression of endogenous alpha2 and alpha3              
              subunit gene transcription. In the proposed studies we intend to               
              examine the underlying molecular mechanism of T3 repression of Na,             
              K-ATPase alpha2 and alpha3 chimeric genes in rat neonatal cardiac              
              myocytes to test the hypothesis that subunit gene transcription                
              rates are inhibited following an interaction of the T3-receptor                
              complex with subunit DNA sequence motifs. Accordingly,the specific             
              aims of the proposed research are: (1) To determine the effect of              
              T3 on the rate of alpha2 and alpha 3 subunit gene transcription by             
              the run-on transcription assay. (2) To ascertain the location and              
              sequence of the element responsible for T3-mediated repression of              
              chimeric gene expression (nTRE) through an analysis of T3-                     
              responsiveness of various truncated subunit/luciferase chimeric                
              genes. (3) To characterize the transacting factor which mediates               
              T3 inhibition of alpha2 and alpha3 subunit chimeric gene activity              
              by an assessment of binding of both unfractionated nuclear extracts            
              and purified T3-receptor to subunit gene fragments containing                  
              negative TREs. We expect that the accomplishment of these research             
              objectives will provide new and significant information concerning             
              fundamental features of T3 action at a molecular level.
