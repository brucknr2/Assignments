Abstract    :
              This project is to continue a series of Re-Os isotopic                         
              investigations designed to address the formation of Archean                    
              cratons; the composition and age of lithospheric mantle, the                   
              interaction between the lithosphere and asthenosphere and the                  
              chemical evolution of the mantle.  Diverse samples of different                
              ages will be analyzed:  1.8 - 3.3 Ga komatiites to basalts; 2.7-3.8            
              GA trondhjemites-tonalite-granodiorites; peridotitic mantle                    
              xenoliths; orogenic lherzolites; and continental mafic and alkalic             
              lavas.  Partitioning experiments for Re and Os between                         
              carbonatite-silicate liquids will be conducted to understand the               
              behavior of Re and Os during mantle enrichment processes.  The                 
              research will combine Re-Os isotopic data with data from one or                
              more of these conventional isotopic systems (plus major and trace              
              element data).  Re and Os abundances and Os isotopic compositions              
              will be analyzed at DTM by negative thermal ionization mass                    
              spectrometry (NTIMS).  The results should not only shed new light              
              on crust-mantle relationships, but also contribute significantly               
              to the development of a new and exciting analytical technique.
