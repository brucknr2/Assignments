Abstract    :
                   Plutons and their wallrocks are an interrelated system in                 
              which the regional strain field and physical condition of the                  
              wallrock influence pluton ascent and emplacement, while the heat,              
              fluids and local strain field of the rising magma in turn influence            
              wallrock deformation.  This project will attempt to better under-              
              stand this interrelationship by study of magmatic strains,                     
              structures and kinematics in three spatially related plutons in the            
              Sierra Nevada and in the adjacent wallrocks.  The data obtained                
              will yield insight into the nature of pluton ascent and emplacement            
              in large volume magmatic arcs, and is expected to be applicable to             
              continental magmatic arcs in general.
