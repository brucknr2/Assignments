Abstract    :
              Phases II research will provide a knowledge base                               
              for developing new generation anti-reflective                                  
              coating products using intrinsically absorbing                                 
              polymer materials.  It will establish how molecular                            
              structure affects the optical, physical, processibility                        
              properties of the polymers in real life lithographic                           
              conditions.  Intrinsically absorbing polymer films for                         
              anti-reflective coatings (ARC) applications is a                               
              significant technological advance over dyed polymer                            
              systems.  By increasing optical density and                                    
              eliminating resist mixing problems, this new                                   
              approach allows ARC technology to be extended                                  
              into I-line and DUV lithography.
