Abstract    :
                   Many terranes in the North American Cordillera contain                    
              Paleozoic arc and basinal assemblages of uncertain paleogeographic             
              origin.  Standard facies and biogeographic analysis have not been              
              able to conclusively separate those terranes that originated along             
              the North American margin from those that experienced greater                  
              transport.  This project will expand and develop a promising new               
              technique to help fingerprint the source of detritus now found in              
              these detrital zircons may provide a unique signature of major                 
              precambrian cratons that would allow the separation of locally                 
              derived terranes from long-traveled allochthonous ones.  The work              
              will consist of extensive sampling in several terranes in the                  
              Pacific Northwest and single-crystal zircon age determination.                 
              Results will help build a data base and will contribute to                     
              understanding the correlation, paleogeographic setting and                     
              displacement history of Paleozoic arc and basinal sequences along              
              the continental margin.
