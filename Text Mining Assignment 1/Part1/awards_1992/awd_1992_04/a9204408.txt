Abstract    :
              This proposal presents a ground-based program of microwave                     
              spectroscopic observations of the mesosphere and lower                         
              thermosphere.  The molecular species O3, CO, HDO (deuterated water),           
              and HO2 will be measured within the mesosphere (50-90 km); and NO              
              will be measured within the lower thermosphere (90-120 km).  In                
              addition, mesospheric wind velocities (over 60-85 km) will be                  
              determined through measurement of doppler shifts in the CO and O3              
              lines.                                                                         
              A wide variety of processes in the mesosphere/lower thermosphere               
              will be studied with these observations.  These include solar                  
              cycle, seasonal, and diurnal variations in lower thermospheric NO              
              peak densities; seasonal and diurnal variations in mesospheric HO2,            
              O3, HDO, and winds; the seasonal variation in mesospheric CO; the              
              photochemical balance of Ox and HOx chemistry in the mesosphere; and           
              the D/H ratio within mesospheric water vapor.  Roughly three four-             
              day periods of observing will be conducted each year at the Kitt               
              Peak NRAO facility (30N latitude).  One additional observing                   
              session per year is planned at the Mauna Kea CSO facility (22oN                
              latitude).  Observations at these various sites will be coordinated            
              to study latitudinal variations, and possibly to obtain NO                     
              observations during periods of high auroral activity.
