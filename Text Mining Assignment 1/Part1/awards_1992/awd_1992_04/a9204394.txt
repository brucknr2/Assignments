Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              We shall study the dynamics of quasiparticles in the cuprate                   
              superconductors, as revealed by scattering upon photon absorption.             
              Determining the temperature- and frequency-dependence of these                 
              processes should help reveal the nature of the transition to the sc            
              state, the spectrum of low-energy excitations and the symmetry of              
              the pairing wave function.
