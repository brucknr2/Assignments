Abstract    :
                   This award provides partial funding (approximately 30%)                   
              required to purchase a gas-source mass spectrometer to be installed            
              and operated in the Department of Geology at the University of                 
              Georgia. The University of Georgia is committed to providing the               
              remaining funds needed for this acquisition.                                   
                   The instrument will be applied initially to the research                  
              projects of the Principal Investigator in the field of stable                  
              isotope geochemistry, including evaluation of stable isotope                   
              thermometry, the mechanisms of sulfur isotope exchange in rock                 
              systems during metamorphism as well as isotope systematics of                  
              hydrothermal and magmatic systems.
