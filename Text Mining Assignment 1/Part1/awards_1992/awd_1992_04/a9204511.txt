Abstract    :
                   Schmid and Bernstein plan to continue their study of the                  
              representation theory of reductive groups and Lie algebras from a              
              variety of points of view.  They plan to employ tools from                     
              topology, algebraic geometry, differential geometry, and                       
              analysis.  The expected results, in turn, will have applications               
              to geometry, number theory, and analysis.                                      
                   The theory of Lie groups, named in honor of the Norwegian                 
              mathematician Sophus Lie, has been one of the major themes in                  
              twentieth century mathematics.  As the mathematical vehicle for                
              exploiting the symmetries inherent in a system, the                            
              representation theory of Lie groups has had a profound impact                  
              upon mathematics itself and theoretical physics, especially                    
              quantum mechanics and elementary particle physics.
