Abstract    :
              The focus of this research is to probe the role of secondary                   
              metabolites in the evolutionary success of the organisms that                  
              produce or acquire them.  Metabolites from opisthobranch                       
              molluscs will be studied to define their function as defense                   
              compounds.  Further, the possibility of the production of                      
              metabolites by symbionts of selected marine invertabrates will                 
              be studied. The focus here will be placed on the production of                 
              polychlorinated metabolites and alkaloids.

              With this renewal award, the Synthetic Organic Program is                      
              supporting the research of Dr. John D. Faulkner of the                         
              University of California, San Diego, Scripps Institute.                        
              Professor Faulkner will focus his work on chemical studies of                  
              marine invertebrates in an effort to discover new natural                      
              products and to investigate their ecological and evolutionary                  
              roles.
