Abstract    :
              Recent rhenium (Re)-osmium (Os) studies on a variety of magmatic               
              products and source materials illustrate the importance of this                
              system to resolving issues of magma and crust-mantle evolution.                
              Preliminary results from a pilot Re-Os study of northwestern U.S.              
              basalts illustrate that combined Re-Os, conventional isotope, and              
              elemental data can help unravel the complexities of source- versus             
              process-related effects.  This work seeks to expand on the pilot               
              study by investigating the Re-Os characteristics of well-documented            
              suites of mafic and silicic extrusive rocks and crustal as well as             
              lithologies from the northwestern and southwestern United States.              
              The results will help to elucidate the details of mantle and                   
              crustal processes and evolution in the continental setting.
