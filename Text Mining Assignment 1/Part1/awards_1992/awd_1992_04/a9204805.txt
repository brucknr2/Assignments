Abstract    :
                   Professor Chai on several problems in arithmetic geometry.                
              These include canonical integral models of Shimura varieties and               
              the theory of p-adic symmetric spaces with a view to an analogue               
              of Schmidt's theorem on degenerations of Hodge structures.                     
                   This project falls into the general area of arithmetic                    
              geometry - a subject that blends two of the oldest areas of                    
              mathematics: number theory and geometry.  This combination has                 
              proved extraordinarily fruitful - having recently solved problems              
              that withstood generations.  Among its many consequences are new               
              error correcting codes.  Such codes are essential for both modern              
              computers (hard disks) and compact disks.
