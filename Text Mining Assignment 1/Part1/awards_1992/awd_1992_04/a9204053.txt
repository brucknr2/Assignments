Abstract    :
                The combination of the enormous DMSP data base of precipitating              
              particles and our several years experience in conducting                       
              statistical studies involving automated identification algorithms              
              suggests a highly fruitful line of research.  We propose to                    
              identify every instance of electron acceleration as evidenced by               
              monoenergetic electron peaks in 7 years of particle data.  We                  
              estimate that the resulting catalog will consist of approximately              
              500,000 electron acceleration events; approximately 3 orders of                
              magnitude more than the largest previous study of electron                     
              acceleration events.  We will also record all instances of electron            
              or ion diffuse aurora above a certain threshold (probably 0.25                 
              ergs/cm2s).  The research will promptly answer some long standing              
              disputes such as the existence of a 1400 "hot spot" of electron                
              acceleration; and the existence of a "prenoon gap" in the discrete             
              aurora.  The huge size of the electron acceleration even catalog               
              will make it possible to subdivide by interplanetary magnetic field            
              Bz and By conditions, as well as indices of magnetic activity, such            
              as Kp and AE.  That is, a result of the proposed research will be              
              maps of the statistical distribution of electron acceleration                  
              events throughout the high latitude regions, at all local times and            
              a variety of binning conditions.  Intense diffuse auroras will be              
              similarly studied; particular attention will be paid to instances              
              of ion energy fluxes exceeding that of electrons (true ion                     
              auroras).  Finally, the entire catalog of 500,000 electron                     
              acceleration events will be shared with the general ionospheric                
              community.  convenient access to the entire list of auroras                    
              encountered by DMSP satellites on any specified day between                    
              December 1983 and December 1990 will also be provided.  Such access            
              will be accomplished in part by extending the existing automatic               
              response system of identifications of the magnetospheric source                
              regions of precipitation.
