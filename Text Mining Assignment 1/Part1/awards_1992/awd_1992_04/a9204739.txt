Abstract    :
              This project is to continue the study of partitioning of trace                 
              elements between minerals and hydrothermal fluids.  How do                     
              hydrothermal fluids acquire trace elements and become ore-forming              
              fluids?  The investigators have recently developed a thermodynamic             
              basis for the partitioning of F and Cl that enables, for the first             
              time, chemical analyses of micas and apatites to be used to place              
              constraints on the pH and the F and Cl contents and speciation of              
              hydrothermal fluids.  They expect to expand the applications to (1)            
              Evaluate the pHs of hydrothermal sedimentary basinal and geothermal            
              fluids; (2) study the origins of F enrichment in Mississippi                   
              Valley-type ore deposits; and (3) extend the study of partitioning             
              to include the trace alkalis and alkaline earths, by using                     
              published experimental studies to calibrate thermodynamic                      
              calculations of partitioning of Li, Rb, Cs, Sr, and Ba between                 
              micas, feldspars and hydrothermal fluids.  The results could have              
              a significant impact upon our understanding of ores develop from               
              hydrothermal solutions.
