Abstract    :
              This award is made by the Divisions of Chemistry, Materials                    
              Research and Molecular and Cellular Biology under the Materials                
              Synthesis and Processing Initiative. The broad goal of the                     
              research is to understand the conformations and surface                        
              interactions of biomolecules at condensed phase interfaces, and                
              the chemical mechanisms of bioadhesion. The specific goals are                 
              to understand the interactions between adhesive peptides and                   
              surfaces and to use these insights to synthesize and                           
              characterize new biocompatible polypeptides having enhanced                    
              adhesive and elastic properties. The focus of the work will be                 
              on peptides related to the repeating decapeptide that comprises                
              mussel adhesive protein (MAP).  The results will be applied to                 
              the design of new materials consisting of adhesive and elastic                 
              polypeptide sequences. These adhesives are also expected to be                 
              biocompatible and stable in vivo, providing a valuable new                     
              class of materials for use in medical and bioanalytical                        
              applications.

              This research will provide new insights into the relationships                 
              between peptide and protein primary structure; into the                        
              chemical interactions governing biopolymer adhesion and folding                
              at surfaces; and in the development of novel biocompatible                     
              adhesives with optimized mechanical properties.
