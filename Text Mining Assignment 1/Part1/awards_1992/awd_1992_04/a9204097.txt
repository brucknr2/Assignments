Abstract    :
                   The principal investigator will continue his study of C-R                 
              geometry and holomorphic maps. He will use methods from analysis               
              such as estimates for the d"-operator as well as geometric                     
              techniques including folliations determined by the Monge-Ampere                
              operator. In another direction, the principal investigator will                
              study iterations of polynomial maps in several complex variables.              
              He will continue his investigation of properties of Julia sets                 
              and the ergodic properties of the maps.                                        
                   This award will support research in the general area of                   
              differential geometry and global analysis. Differential geometry               
              is the study of the relationship between the geometry of a space               
              and analytic concepts defined on the space. Global analysis is                 
              the study of the overall geometric and topological properties of               
              a space by piecing together local information. Applications of                 
              these areas of mathematics in other sciences include the                       
              structure of complicated molecules, liquid-gas boundaries, and                 
              the large scale structure of the universe.
