Abstract    :
              This research extends existing models of creep deformation in metal            
              matrix composite (MMC) materials to include limited fiber/matrix               
              interfacial adhesion, matrix materials exhibiting work hardening               
              and anisotropy, and three dimensional microstructures.  Experiments            
              and simulations are anticipated for aluminum/silicon carbide and               
              copper/tungsten MMC systems, according to a four part plan.  (1)               
              Important constituent and interface properties are measured using              
              several novel experiments and the microstructural configurations               
              are determined using metallographic techniques. (2) Finite element             
              simulations are carried out to predict non-isothermal creep rates              
              in the two MMC systems.  These simulations will be expanded later              
              to include a wider range of microstructures, constituent and                   
              interface properties, and temperature/load paths.  (3) The non-                
              isothermal deformation rates for the two MMC systems are measured              
              in uniaxial tension and biaxial tension as functions of                        
              temperature/load paths. (4) The experimental results and model                 
              predictions for the two systems are compared and a consistent                  
              model for evaluating the creep-based lifetimes of MMC systems with             
              non-isothermal histories are developed.                                        
              %%%                                                                            
              Currently there is a strong interest in materials suitable for                 
              moderately elevated temperature structural applications requiring              
              low density, high static strength, and good creep resistance.  MMC             
              materials exhibit some of these properties and promise great                   
              improvements in component lifetimes and performance.
