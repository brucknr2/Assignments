Abstract    :
                   The principal investigator will study the geometric                       
              invariants of elliptic operators via the adiabatic limit method.               
              In particular he will try to understand their behavior under a                 
              general process of surgery. One of the invariants to be studied                
              is the analytic torsion. The eta invariant and determinant will                
              also be considered. One motivation for the research is the recent              
              work of Bismut and Lebeau on the arithmetic Riemann-Roch theorem.              
                   This award will support research in the general area of                   
              differential geometry and global analysis. Differential geometry               
              is the study of the relationship between the geometry of a space               
              and analytic concepts defined on the space. Global analysis is                 
              the study of the overall geometric and topological properties of               
              a space by piecing together local information. Applications of                 
              these areas of mathematics in other sciences include the                       
              structure of complicated molecules, liquid-gas boundaries, and                 
              the large scale structure of the universe.
