Abstract    :
                This research is a continuation of the determination of seismic              
              wave attenuation within the earth.  Preliminary results show                   
              evidence for the existence of a strong degree 2 attenuation in                 
              the depth range corresponding to the upper mantle low Q zone.                  
              Data collection will be significantly increased by including very              
              long period fundamental mode Rayleigh wave data accumulated in                 
              the past 2 years a 20 Geoscope stations and several IRIS                       
              stations.  3D models of attenuation for the earth will be                      
              generated with particular attention to the Pacific Ocean zone                  
              where a deep rooted attenuation maximum is postulated.  The 3D                 
              models will provide information on uppermantle temperature and                 
              viscosity distributions with a goal of understanding the                       
              convective processes in the upper mantle.
