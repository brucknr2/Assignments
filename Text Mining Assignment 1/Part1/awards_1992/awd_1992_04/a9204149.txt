Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  The object of this research is the measurement of the                     
              radiative properties of water clouds near the Azores (June 1992) as            
              a component of the Atlantic Stratocumulus Transition Experiment                
              (ASTEX).  In particular, the University of Washington research                 
              aircraft will make measurements of the spectral absorption of solar            
              radiation by these clouds, the optical thickness, effective                    
              particle size, bidirectional reflectance of cloud tops, and the                
              flux of ultraviolet radiation in and above the clouds.  Also, as               
              opportunities permit, microphysical structure and radiative                    
              measurements will be made of clouds modified by the effluents from             
              ships.
