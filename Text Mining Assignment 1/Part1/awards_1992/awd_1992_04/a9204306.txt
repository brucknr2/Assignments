Abstract    :
                   This research is concerned with showing that hyperplanes of               
              the major embeddable Lie incidence geometries all arise from                   
              embeddings.  The cases that remain are dual polar spaces,                      
              geometries associated with exceptional Lie groups, and certain                 
              exceptional fields for the half-spin geometries.  A class of                   
              geometries crucial to forming general theorems about Veldkamp                  
              spaces will also be considered.  The principal investigator will               
              continue work on ?m!-ovoids, which are generalizations of both                 
              ovoids and spreads of polar spaces.                                            
                   The research in this project involves the interplay between               
              finite dimensional geometry and the actions of groups of                       
              transformations on these geometries.  This work has implications               
              for the structure of finite groups, for algebraic coding theory,               
              and for finite geometry.
