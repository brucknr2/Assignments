Abstract    :
              The objective of this proposal is to gain an understanding of the              
              molecular mechanisms of lymphoid V(D)J recombination and DNA                   
              double-strand break (DSB) repair. These two pathways share at least            
              one common factor, the SCID (severe combined immune deficiency)                
              gene product and probably share many others.  In particular, we                
              intend to determine whether this overlap can be extended to the                
              murine wasted mutation, which confers onto affected animals a                  
              severe immune deficiency and a sensitivity to ionizing radiation.              
              The high cancer rate associated with DNA repair defects suggests               
              that generalized DSB repair is also critical for many other                    
              important biological processes including chromosome integrity and              
              stability, mutagenesis and carcinogenesis as well as lymphoid V(D)J            
              recombination.  These two important biological pathways will be                
              characterized using 3 lines of experimentation:  1)Does the wasted             
              (wst) mutation affect the process of V(D)J recombination?  2)What              
              are the DNA repair defects associated with the wst and scid                    
              mutations?  3)Do the scid and wst mutations affect homologous                  
              and/or illegitimate (non-homologous) recombination?                            
              %%%%                                                                           
              The ultimate goal of these studies will be to use the scid and wst             
              mutations as tools to understand the molecular mechanisms of                   
              lymphoid gene rearrangement and DNA repair.
