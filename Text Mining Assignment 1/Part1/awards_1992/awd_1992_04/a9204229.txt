Abstract    :
                   This award supports the 1992 Benjamin Franklin Symposium                  
              in Celebration of the Discovery of the Neutrino; Philadelphia,                 
              Pennsylvania on April 30 - May 1, 1992.  Twenty-one talks are                  
              scheduled to review the current status of neutrino physics                     
              research efforts world-wide.  The topics include solar                         
              neutrino experiments, double beta decay, neutrino mass and                     
              oscillation, neutrinos from reactors and supernova.
