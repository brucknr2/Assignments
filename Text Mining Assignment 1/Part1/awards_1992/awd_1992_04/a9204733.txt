Abstract    :
                   The principal investigators will continue research in the                 
              chaotic behavior of dynamical systems. In particular they will                 
              study the Henon and standard maps which are the prototypical                   
              examples of nonuniformly elliptic hyperbolic systems in dimension              
              two. The will attempt to prove the existence of chaotic behavior               
              by proving the positivity of Lyapunov exponents. They will also                
              study the Julia sets in complex dynamics, particularly in the                  
              nonuniform hyperbolic case.                                                    
                   This award will support research in the general area of                   
              dynamical systems. A process which is very simple and easy to                  
              understand locally can become extremely complicated, nonlinear,                
              and difficult to analyze globally. Dynamical systems is the study              
              of this local to global relationship. Many physical systems can                
              best be modeled using this area of mathematics including fluid                 
              flow and turbulence, complex biological systems, mechanical                    
              systems, and chemical reactions.
