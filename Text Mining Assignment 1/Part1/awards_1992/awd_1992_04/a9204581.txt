Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              They should study how spatially varying potentials affect the                  
              states of interacting quantum and classical systems.  Experiments              
              will be performed on superconducting arrays, semiconductor                     
              heterojunctions, density-wave systems and high-field                           
              superconductors.
