Abstract    :
                This research is to develop a technique to date movements on                 
              faults by analysis of the distribution of cosmic-ray-flux-                     
              generated carbon-14 in calcite on exposed limestone fault scarps.              
              The initial area of investigation will be in Pleasant Valley,                  
              Nevada, and in the Oquirrh-Stansbury Ranges, Utah.  Carbon-14                  
              production will be calibrated on surfaces of known age such as                 
              Bonneville and Provo Shoreline features which have previously                  
              been used to calibrate in situ produced cosmogenic isotopes.                   
              Future studies could be extended to use other minerals which will              
              greatly extend the method's usefulness.  The goal is to extend                 
              the record of earthquake occurrence on exposed faults into pre-                
              historical times.  This research is a component of the National                
              Earthquake Hazard Reduction Program.
