Abstract    :
                   The basic problem Wermer will study is the description of all             
              commuting algebras of operators on a finite dimensional Hilbert                
              space in which the k-fold von Neumann inequality holds for all k.              
              A second part of the project will be to generalize the results of              
              Alexander, Slodkowski, Forstneric and others on the polynomial hull            
              of a set in C^2 lying over the unit circle S, to the corresponding             
              problem when S is replaced by the boundary of the unit ball in C^2.            
                   The general area of mathematics of this project has its basis             
              in the theory of algebras of Hilbert space operators.  Operators               
              can be thought of as finite or infinite matrices of complex                    
              numbers.  Special types of operators are often put together in an              
              algebra, naturally called an operator algebra.  These abstract                 
              objects have a surprising variety of applications.  For example,               
              they play a key role in knot theory, which in turn is  currently               
              being used to study the structure of DNA, and they are of                      
              fundamental importance in noncommutative geometry, which is                    
              becoming increasingly important in physics.
