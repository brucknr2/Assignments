Abstract    :
              Fast atom bombardment (FAB) mass spectrometry will be evaluated as             
              a method to measure surface area excess concentration at the gas-              
              glycerol interface of peptides.  Surface concentrations measured               
              using FAB MS will be compared to those measured using the                      
              radiotracer technique, the only method currently in use to directly            
              quantify the concentration of proteins and peptides at gas-liquid              
              phase.  If successful, the first highly accurate data will be                  
              acquired describing the behavior of peptides at N2-glycerol and                
              vacuum-glycerol interfaces.  The behavior of peptides and proteins             
              in non-aqueous solvents is of increasing importance because of the             
              chemical and biotechnology studies and application of enzymatic                
              synthesis in non-aqueous solvents.  In addition to the development             
              of a new method, this research will add knowledge about the                    
              fundamental mechanism of FAB ionization.  This research will be                
              carried out by a chemist and two chemical engineers in consultation            
              with a protein biochemist.
