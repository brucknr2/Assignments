Abstract    :
                   This underlying theme of this project is an attempt to                    
              understand the roots of classes of functions which arise in                    
              complex analysis and number theory called zeta functions.  There               
              are several important sets of zeta functions to be analyzed: (i)               
              linear combinations of Euler products; (ii) Epstein zeta                       
              functions (of both the rational and irrational type); (iii)                    
              Selberg zeta functions associated with cofinite Fuchsian groups;               
              (iv) L- functions associated with eigenfunctions of the Laplace                
              operator taken over fundamental domains or Riemann surfaces.                   
              Several methods will be employed.  One involves the variation of               
              parameters in the definition of functions.  As the parameters                  
              move about, the roots trace paths which are studied from a                     
              statistical/dynamical point of view.  Supercomputer analysis is                
              also used to unravel complex relationships in cases where                      
              functions form finite dimensional vector spaces.  Two particular               
              goals are to give growth rates of the roots and to determine                   
              whether or not all roots lie on simple subsets such as lines.                  
                   This work has important application to fundamental and long-              
              standing questions in number theory.  It also leads to new uses                
              of supercomputing in the more theoretical areas of mathematical                
              analysis, both as an experimental tools and one which can give                 
              sharp probability estimates in situations where precise                        
              information is too difficult to extract from the functional                    
              definitions.
