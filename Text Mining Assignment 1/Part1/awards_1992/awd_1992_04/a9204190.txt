Abstract    :
                   This grant supports the research of Professors Brian Conrey               
              and Amit Ghosh to work in analytic number theory.  Professors                  
              Conrey and Ghosh will study a broad class of problems involving                
              the analytic continuation of L-functions and their growth.  In                 
              particular, they will study both general problems about                        
              classifying Dirichlet series and particular questions involving                
              mean-value theorems for specific L-functions of arithmetic                     
              interest.                                                                      
                   The field of analytic number theory applies to the discrete               
              realm of the whole numbers the techniques of analysis, dependent               
              on the notions of continuity and limit, originating in calculus.               
              The idea of using continuous methods to investigate the discrete               
              is two centuries old, but with the work of the modern analytic                 
              number theorists, the field has had a new rebirth.
