Abstract    :
                   This proposal has four separate experimental parts, all                   
              related by their goal of attempting to solve different aspects of              
              the problem of how a set of regulatory gene activities turns                   
              undifferentiated floral primordia into complex and precise arrays              
              of many differentiated cell types.  The experiments proposed are 1)            
              to study in great molecular detail two floral regulatory genes that            
              we have already cloned (APETALA3 and PISTILLATA); 2) to clone and              
              similarly study the cadastral gene SUPERMAN 3) to find new genes               
              with regulatory effects on flower development, and others which                
              interact with the regulatory genes, whose study should reveal as               
              much about floral pattern formation as has been revealed by the                
              study of the homeotic and cadastral genes so far known; and 4) to              
              take the description of wild-type and mutant flower development to             
              a new level of cellular analysis, using laser scanning confocal                
              microsopy, as a way of answering many of the questions left                    
              unanswered by the analyses that have been done to date.                        
              %%%                                                                            
              Plants flower and then produce, thus although Arabidopsis is a weed            
              and of no commercial concern, if an understanding of how flower                
              development is genetically controlled results from this work, the              
              economic implications are significant.
