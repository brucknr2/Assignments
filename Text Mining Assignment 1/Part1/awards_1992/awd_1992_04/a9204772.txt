Abstract    :
                   Proposed research in the Devonian of the western United States            
              involves three broad areas of endeavor.  1. Brachiopod systematics:            
                                                                                             
              especially Siluro-Devonian spiriferid brachiopods at the genus,                
              family, and subordinal levels, their range events, and                         
              biogeographical significance, in connection with preparation of the            
              revised edition of the Brachiopod Treatise.                                    
                   2. Brachiopod and conodont biostratigraphy of the Middle                  
              Devonian and conodont biostratigraphy across the Frasnian-Famennian            
              boundary.  In these sequences Great Basin depositional history is              
              being investigated with a focus on eustatic events of deepening                
              (Middle Devonian) and platform exposure (Upper Devonian).                      
                   3.  Investigation of the Upper Devonian faunal sequence, with             
              emphasis on brachiopod-dominated communities and zones integrated              
              with the conodont zonal scheme, will continue to build on published            
              research that has made known the Lower and Middle Devonian                     
              sequence.
