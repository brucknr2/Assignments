Abstract    :
                   Professor Fisher will work on the equidistribution theorem for            
              Kloosterman sums.  He also hopes to generalize Katz's                          
              equidistribution theorem to lisse sheaves with traces in a number              
              field.  He also hopes to study numerically the distinctness of                 
              Kloosterman sums.                                                              
                   This project falls into the general area of arithmetic                    
              geometry - a subject that blends two of the oldest areas of                    
              mathematics: number theory and geometry.  This combination has                 
              proved extraordinarily fruitful - having recently solved problems              
              that withstood generations.  Among its many consequences are new               
              error correcting codes.  Such codes are essential for both modern              
              computers (hard disks) and compact disks.
