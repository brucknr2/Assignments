Abstract    :
              This research on problems in complexity theory, has several                    
              particular goals:  (1) improved (non-)hierarchy theorems for                   
              probabilistic time complexity classes and related models of                    
              computation, (2) improved characterizations of arithmetic                      
              circuits in terms of Boolean circuits and related classes,                     
              (3) increased understanding of the relation between the                        
              complexity of the determinant and other complexity classes,                    
              and (4) increased understanding of small-depth circuit                         
              complexity classes, such as ACC and AC.
