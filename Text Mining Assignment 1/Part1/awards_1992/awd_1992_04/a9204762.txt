Abstract    :
                   Rock magnetic studies have entered a new phase of high-                   
              sensitivity analysis, in which it is possible to unravel the                   
              physics of magnetism at the level of single magnetic grains.  The              
              PI will do a suite of experiments to study magnetic domain behavior            
              and hysteresis loops of single particles, using the magneto-                   
              optical Kerr effect and an alternating force magnetometer.  The two            
              primary goals of this work are:  1: To determine whether the                   
              behavior of a large assemblage of particles is well-represented by             
              he behavior of an average grain making up the assemblage.  2. To               
              extract microphysical data that are critical to understanding the              
              hysteresis behavior of single particles.
