Abstract    :
                   Orr and Pitts will study the structure of nonselfadjoint                  
              operator algebras.  In particular, they propose to classify all                
              closed two-sided ideals in continuous nest algebras.  Understanding            
              these ideals is likely to lead to new constructions and techniques             
              with triangular operator algebras.   Additionally, Pitts proposes              
              to find conditions weaker than hyperreflexivity which ensure that              
              a CSL is stable, and Orr proposes to study ideal structure of CSL              
              algebras and new maximal triangular algebras.                                  
                   The general area of mathematics of this project has its basis             
              in the theory of algebras of Hilbert space operators.  Operators               
              can be thought of as finite or infinite matrices of complex                    
              numbers.  Special types of operators are often put together in an              
              algebra, naturally called an operator algebra.  These seemingly                
              abstract objects have a surprising variety of applications.  For               
              example, they play a key role in knot theory, which in turn is                 
              currently being used to study the structure of DNA.
