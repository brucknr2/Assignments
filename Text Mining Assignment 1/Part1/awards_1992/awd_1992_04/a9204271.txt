Abstract    :
                   The research to be performed will be in the following areas:              
              Computational and Analytical Problems in Neutron Transport Theory              
              (C. Borgers).  Problems from rarefied gas dynamics and neutron                 
              transport will be studied.  1) Gas film lubrication is                         
              traditionally modeled by the Reynolds equation, derived from the               
              compressible Navier-Stokes equations.  Here an approach based on               
              the simplest kinetic model, free molecular flow, is proposed.  2)              
              Discrete analogs of this statement will be studied, with emphasis              
              on time discretization.                                                        
                   Viscous Systems of Hyperbolic Conservation Laws and                       
              Hamilton-Jacobi Equations (E. Harabetian).  This proposal                      
              concerns the analysis and development of numerical techniques for              
              problems in hyperbolic conservation laws and their viscous                     
              perturbation, and Hamilton-Jacobi equations.  The specific                     
              problems proposed are 1) Multidimensional front propagation for                
              hyperbolic conservation laws and the modeling of viscous effects.              
              2) Convergence to a steady state for Hamilton-Jacobi equations,                
              with application to "shape for shading" problems.                              
                   Vortex Sheet Computations (R. Krasny).  Various aspects of                
              vortex sheet motion will be studied.  1) The vortex blob method                
              will be extended and applied to splitter plate flow.  2) Compact               
              cutoff functions and multipole algorithms for vortex sheet motion              
              will be investigated.  3) Vortex blob, Navier Stokes, and                      
              experimental results for wake flow will be compared, to asses he               
              effect of neglecting physical viscosity in the vortex sheet                    
              model.  4) Axisymmetric vortex sheet roll-up will be computed, in              
              free space and at the edge of a round pipe.
