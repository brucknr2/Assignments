Abstract    :
              This proposal seeks partial funding for an                                     
              international conference on the topic of organic non-                          
              linear optics with meeting headquarters at                                     
              Washington State University.  The purpose of the                               
              meeting is to bring together top researchers - whose                           
              expertise spans material design, material                                      
              characterization, device fabrication, and integrated                           
              device architectures - to the intimate setting of a                            
              small university town to discuss and assess progress                           
              in the field.
