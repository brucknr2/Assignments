Abstract    :
              The principal investigator will study the factors that influence               
              trace element partitioning in crystals during growth, and particu-             
              larly the influence of surface structure. He will concentrate on               
              a study of calcite, utilizing a variety of spectroscopic techniques            
              that enable detailed examination of the mineral surface. He will               
              also study surface-controlled differential partitioning trends in              
              dolomite, topaz and quartz. In general he hopes to develop an                  
              understanding of the principles governing the influence of mineral             
              surfaces on the differential partitioning of trace elements in                 
              minerals.
