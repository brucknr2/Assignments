Abstract    :
                   Several mathematical problems situated at the interface                   
              between harmonic analysis and probability theory will be                       
              addressed in this project. The application of probability theory               
              to questions of mathematical analysis has a rich history of                    
              success in refocusing the point of view and providing new,                     
              powerful methods.                                                              
                   Among the targets of this work is an examination of                       
              Khintchine's inequality for lacunary trigonometric series.  This               
              inequality bounds the p-norm of the Rademacher expansion of a                  
              function by sums of (squares of) the coefficient.  The same type               
              of inequality obtains if a lacunary expansion is used.  Efforts                
              will be made to show that the constant in the lower bound can be               
              estimated accurately enough to measure its dependence on the p-th              
              power.                                                                         
                   A second line of investigation concerns tail laws of the                  
              iterated logarithm for harmonic functions. This law, discovered                
              by Kolmogorov in 1950,  measures partial sums of trigonometric                 
              series against the sum of squares of its coefficients.  The tail               
              law is similar except that it compares only the tail of the                    
              series and tail of the coefficients.  Recently analogous results               
              have been obtained in which harmonic functions are compared with               
              iterated logarithms of their gradients. Current work seeks to                  
              give estimates of corresponding tail comparison.                               
                   Other work seeks to relate developments of exponential                    
              martingales with classical Littlewood-Paley theory.
