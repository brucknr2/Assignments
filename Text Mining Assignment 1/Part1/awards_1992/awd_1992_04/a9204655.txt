Abstract    :
              This project is concerned with building a fast and theoretically               
              well founded reasoner - a massively parallel transitivity-tree                 
              reasoner - for general AI.  AI reasoning algorithms are often                  
              intractable, that is they are too slow for any practical problem               
              sizes to be of real value.  A widely used approach to overcome                 
              these problems has been to create special purpose reasoners.                   
              Such reasoners solve only a very limited set of problems, and are              
              too restricted in architecture.  This research is aimed at                     
              designing a reasoner that is more general than current special                 
              purpose reasoners and faster than existing general reasoners.                  
              This reasoner will have a well defined interface to a general                  
              purpose reasoner.
