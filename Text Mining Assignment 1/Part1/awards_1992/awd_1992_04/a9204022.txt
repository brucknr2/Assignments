Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Experiments involving a quartz-crystal microbalance (QCM) are                  
              proposed, some specifically designed to test theories of atomic-               
              scale friction, others to explore practical applications of the QCM            
              technique itself (including its utilization for the formation of               
              patterned nanostructures).
