Abstract    :
                   The PI will investigate hotspots.  The intent is to constrain             
              their underlying physical processes, mainly heat and mass transfer.            
              the work has helped establish the current consensus that both on-              
              ridge hotspots like Iceland and midplate hotspots like Hawaii are              
              produced by mantle plumes that arise from the lowermost mantle.                
              he will continue to document the time dependence of the heat fluxes            
              of hotspots over the last 100 m.y. or so where there is good                   
              record.  For example, Hawaii has strengthened with time while                  
              Louisville has waned to a weak hotspot.  He has constructed simple             
              numerical models to related these changes to local depletion of the            
              basal boundary layer by plumes and the thickening of the layer by              
              flow driven by lateral density contrasts.  He is also studying                 
              shallower processes particularly heat and material transfer from               
              plumes to the moving lithosphere of midplate swells.
