Abstract    :
                   In addition to measurements on molten core materials, the PI              
              will measure compressional and bulk wave velocities of preheated               
              samples of selected mantle minerals and analogs, including MgO,                
              MgA12O4, A12O3 and CaTiO3 (in the perovskite structure).  He will              
              conduct more measurements on core materials and to increase the                
              present 2-4% accuracy of these types of measurements by upgrading              
              recording electronics to the state-of-the-art.  Such measurements              
              are required because at present the high-temperature, low-pressure             
              measurements of parameters, for the above mantle minerals are                  
              discrepant with variations inferred from seismic tomography and                
              correlations of the velocity structure with the low order harmonics            
              of the geoid.
