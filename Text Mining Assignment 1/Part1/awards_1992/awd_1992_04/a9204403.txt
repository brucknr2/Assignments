Abstract    :
              This Science in Developing Countries (SDC) award                               
              will partially support the Fifth Pan American                                  
              Symposium on Perspectives for Pan American                                     
              Collaboration in Experimental Physics to be held in                            
              Cartagena, Colombia. The Symposium, which is jointly                           
              organized by Professor Leon Lederman of the                                    
              University of Chicago, Dr. Roy Rubinstein of                                   
              Universities Research Associates, Inc., and                                    
              Professor Eduardo Posada of the Universidad Nacional                           
              de Colombia, proposes to review the status of high                             
              energy particle physics and other fields of physics                            
              with an emphasis on increasing Latin-American                                  
              participation in science and the associated                                    
              technology.                                                                    
                                                                                             
              The Symposium will help to stimulate and assist in                             
              the formation of research groups in Latin America                              
              and explore mechanisms for U.S.-Latin American                                 
              collaboration in various fields of physics. The                                
              meeting will bring together outstanding researchers                            
              from the U.S. and Latin America and should help to                             
              improve communications among them.
