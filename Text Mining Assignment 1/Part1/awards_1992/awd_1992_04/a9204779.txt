Abstract    :
              The principal investigator will study the structures of silicate               
              melts and glasses at very high pressures using synchrotron X-ray               
              diffraction. The study will help geologists better understand                  
              melting and melt properties throughout the Earth, and especially               
              in the Earth's mantle.
