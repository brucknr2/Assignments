Abstract    :
                   This is a proposal to provide support for SEDI, and IUGG Union            
              Committee to Study the Earth's Deep Interior.  The principal                   
              objective of SEDI is to foster and facilitate cooperative studies              
              of the structure, composition, energetics and dynamics of the                  
              Earth's deep interior, particularly the lower mantle, the core and             
              the core-mantle boundary region.  The support includes (a)                     
              participant support costs for US scientists to attend the third                
              SEDI Symposium to be held in Mizusawa, Japan, July 6-10, 1992, and             
              (b) administrative support of the SEDI secretariat, or the period              
              1992 through 1995.
