Abstract    :
                   The investigator intends to consider ramifications and                    
              applications of a result he has recently proved, namely that a K-              
              theory can be defined for any triangulated category in such a way              
              that the K-theory of the bounded derived category of an abelian                
              category A agrees with the K-theory of A.                                      
                   Although this project is highly algebraic, one motivation lies            
              in its potential for reducing geometric information to a subject               
              for calculation by perfecting one of the principal algebraic tools             
              used for this purpose.  The nature of the geometric information                
              involved is the crux of the difficulty.  While questions about                 
              lengths, areas, angles, volumes, and so forth virtually cry out to             
              be reduced to calculations, it is far different with what are known            
              as topological properties of geometric objects.  These are                     
              properties such as connectedness (being all in one piece),                     
              knottedness, having no holes, and so forth.  All systematic study              
              of such properties, for example, how to tell whether two geometric             
              objects really differ in respect to one of these properties or are             
              only superficially different, or how to classify the variety of                
              differences that can occur, all these have only truly been                     
              comprehended and mastered when they have been reduced to matters of            
              calculation.  Algebraic K-theory has been developed into a major               
              tool for this purpose, and the interplay between the algebra and               
              the topology involved remains a fascinating subject.
