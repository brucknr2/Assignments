Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  The objective of this research is the measurement of                      
              (integrated) water vapor using the Global Positioning System (GPS)             
              of satellites wherein the travel times between the satellite and               
              the receiver at the earth's surface can be used as a calibrated                
              measure of the integrated water vapor along the signal propagation             
              path.  Independent measurements of the same quantity will be made              
              by microwave radiometers and conventional radiosondes.
