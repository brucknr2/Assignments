Abstract    :
              Although mechanized induction is relevant for science and                      
              technology, standard methods, such as similarity-based learning,               
              are seriously limited for learning hard concepts from poorly                   
              understood domains.  Several important domains, such as protein                
              folding, would benefit from more advanced treatment of data and                
              partial knowledge to construct new features that help similarity-              
              based learning.  The goal of this project is to improve methods                
              for feature construction, using increased interaction between                  
              computer and user to take advantage of the strengths of each.                  
              Two thrusts of this project are more dynamic construction and                  
              more interactive refinement.  For dynamic construction, the                    
              problem of constructing representations is decomposed into                     
              several subproblems for forming and selecting components for new               
              features.  Components are dynamically determined by information                
              contained in automated analysis of data and knowledge.  For                    
              interactive refinement, the approach allows partial specification              
              of "hunches", which can represent domain-dependent or independent              
              heuristics.  These fragments of knowledge can be updated by the                
              learning systems and re-examined by the user.
