Abstract    :
              The goal of this study is to understand techniques that lead                   
              to efficient parallel algorithms.  The methodology is                          
              experimental, performance is measured in terms of actual                       
              implementation.  A wide range of parallel architectures are                    
              considered.  The current work is on shared memory                              
              multiprocessors, and the plan is to expand the study to                        
              include non-shared memory machines and networks of                             
              workstations.  The application domains to be studied include                   
              combinatorial optimization, dynamic computational geometry                     
              (with applications to molecular dynamics simulation),                          
              rendering algorithms, and physical systems simulation.
