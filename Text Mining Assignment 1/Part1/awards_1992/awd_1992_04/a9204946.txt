Abstract    :
                  Professor Smyth will continue his research on sets of                      
              principal curvatures of hypersurfaces in Euclidean space and to                
              extend some of the techniques previously developed to spaces of                
              constant curvature.  The anticipated results may be employed to                
              obtain some interesting generalizations of previous classical                  
              results for isoparametric hypersurfaces.  Xavier will continue                 
              his research on the study of complete embedded simply-connected                
              minimal surfaces and relationships with algebraic curve geometry.
