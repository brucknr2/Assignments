Abstract    :
                   The principal investigators will continue their                           
              investigation of problems in differential and algebraic geometry.              
              In particular they will investigate the structure of Chow                      
              varieties via the method of characteristic classes. Results are                
              expected to have relationships with Bott periodicity, the Hodge                
              conjecture, and the Schubert calculus.                                         
                   This award will support research in the general area of                   
              differential geometry and global analysis. Differential geometry               
              is the study of the relationship between the geometry of a space               
              and analytic concepts defined on the space. Global analysis is                 
              the study of the overall geometric and topological properties of               
              a space by piecing together local information. Applications of                 
              these areas of mathematics in other sciences include the                       
              structure of complicated molecules, liquid-gas boundaries, and                 
              the large scale structure of the universe.
