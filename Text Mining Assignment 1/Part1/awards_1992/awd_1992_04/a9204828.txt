Abstract    :
                   This award provides 42% of the funds needed to acquire a gas              
              source stable isotope ratio mass spectrometer to be installed and              
              operated in the Department of Geology at Washington State                      
              University. The University is committed to providing the remaining             
              funds necessary for this acquisition.                                          
                   The instrument will be suitable for measuring the ratios of               
              carbon and oxygen isotopes in carbon dioxide samples prepared from             
              carbonate, silicate and oxide minerals, as well as the deuterium               
              to hydrogen ratios in hydrogen gas samples prepared from water or              
              mineral samples. It will be used primarily in studies of the role              
              of fluid-rock interactions and fluid evolution in the production               
              of vein deposits of economic value. The instrument will be made                
              available for use by faculty and graduate students at Washington               
              State University, The University of Idaho, and other regional                  
              research groups.
