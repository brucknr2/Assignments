Abstract    :
              The principal investigator will study two igneous intrusions within            
              the Bays-of-Maine complex, using field, microscopic, and analytical            
              techniques. The main goals of the study are to understand the                  
              processes of hybridization, the physical and chemical interactions             
              between basaltic replenishemnts and underlying silicic cumulates,              
              and the effect of basalt replenishment on magmatic compositional               
              history.
