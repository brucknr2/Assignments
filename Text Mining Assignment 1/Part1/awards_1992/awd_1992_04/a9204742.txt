Abstract    :
              This research consists of three directions.  The first                         
              direction is devoted to average case complexity.  Specific                     
              issues include natural complete problems, reduction theory,                    
              and specific graph problems.  The second direction involves a                  
              variety of other complexity issues.  Specific issues include                   
              time-space trade-offs, nontraditional approaches and linear                    
              time.  The third direction is devoted to finite model theory.                  
              Specific issues include classical first order theorems and the                 
              logic of functions.
