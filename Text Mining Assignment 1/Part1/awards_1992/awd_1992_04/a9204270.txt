Abstract    :
                   Margulis will continue his work on different application of               
              the theory of subgroup actions on homogeneous spaces to number                 
              theory and Diophantine approximations.  He will study discrete                 
              groups of affine transformations, and in particular the algebraic              
              structure of cocompact discrete groups of affine transformations.              
              He will also continue his work on the Zariski closure of the                   
              linear part of an arbitrary discrete group of affine                           
              transformations.                                                               
                   This project involves research in ergodic theory.  Ergodic                
              theory in general concerns understanding the average behavior of               
              systems whose dynamics is too complicated or chaotic to be                     
              followed in microscopic detail.  Under the heading "dynamics                   
              can be placed the modern theory of how groups of abstract                      
              transformations act on smooth spaces.  In this way ergodic theory              
              makes contact with geometry in its quest to classify flows on                  
              homogeneous spaces.
