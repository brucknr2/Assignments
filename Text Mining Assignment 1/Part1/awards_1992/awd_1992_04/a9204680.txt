Abstract    :
                   This project involves collecting information on the structure             
              and electrical transport properties of silicates-analogue liquids              
              at high pressures and temperatures and on the structures of glasses            
              formed at high pressures and temperatures and quenched only in                 
              temperature.  The primary structural probes are vibrational                    
              spectroscopy: principally Raman spectroscopy for the liquids, and              
              infrared spectroscopy or quenched glasses held in situ at high                 
              pressures.  The plan is to utilize the externally heated diamond               
              cell to generate pressure and temperature for both spectroscopic               
              and conductivity experiments on liquids, and laser heating coupled             
              with the diamond anvil cell to form high pressure glasses.  Such               
              data are critically important in predicting and evaluating changes             
              in the physical properties, such as density and viscosity, of                  
              magmatic liquids under compression, and bear fundamentally on the              
              processes by which the Earth has differentiated to its present                 
              state.  The goals is to provide a structural basis for changes in              
              the geochemical, thermodynamics, and transport properties of                   
              silicate melts at high pressures.  These experiments have been                 
              rendered feasible by recent advancements in both the generation and            
              calibration of high pressures and temperatures within the diamond              
              anvil cell, as well as advances in solid-state detector technology.
