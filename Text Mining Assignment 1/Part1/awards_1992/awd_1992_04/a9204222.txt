Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This proposal requests funds for an Environmental SEM (ESEM) for the           
              Cornell Materials Science Center (MSC) Electron Microscope Facility.           
              This instrument provides the special ability to observe a sample in gas        
              atmospheres with typical pressure between about 1 to 20 Torr while the         
              electron gun remains at high vacuum.  This instrument will enable the          
              Cornell materials community to perform research requiring the in-situ          
              observation of samples during the experiments with environments having         
              well controlled temperature and gas atmosphere.  The research projects         
              currently planned to use this SEM involve different materials such as          
              ceramics, electronic materials, metals, and polymers.   This instrument        
              will be maintained by the MSC and made available to all interested             
              users.
