Abstract    :
                   Several problems in atomic collision physics are                          
              addressed.  These include state to state interactions of                       
              excited Ca and N atoms with rare gas partners and collisional                  
              ionization.  The research encompasses the calculation of                       
              appropriate interaction potentials using a combination of ab-                  
              initio and semi-empirical approaches and quantum mechanical                    
              close coupling calculations.  The calculations are strongly                    
              coupled to experiments in the US and West Germany.
