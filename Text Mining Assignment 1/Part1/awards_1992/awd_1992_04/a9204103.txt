Abstract    :
                   This grant supports continuing basic research in                          
              theoretical nuclear physics.  The topics include deriving the                  
              nucleon-nucleon interaction from the solitons of an effective                  
              meson field theory, algebraic approaches to nuclear and atomic                 
              scattering problems and the possible role of supersymmetry in                  
              nuclei.
