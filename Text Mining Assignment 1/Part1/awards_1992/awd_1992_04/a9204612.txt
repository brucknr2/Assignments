Abstract    :
              This workshop will provide a forum for addressing                              
              future research directions in nonlinear control, and                           
              help coordinate U.S. and international research in this                        
              field.  Topics of particular interest include:                                 
              Stabilization and Nonlinear design; Artificial neural                          
              nets as nonlinear system components; Optimization,                             
              Optimal Control and Non-Smooth Methods;                                        
              Applications: Robotics, Aerospace, Power Systems,                              
              Process Control...; Distributed-Parameter Nonlinear
