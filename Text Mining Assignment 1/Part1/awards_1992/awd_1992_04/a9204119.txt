Abstract    :
                   The principal investigator will support graduate students                 
              working on problems in the areas of geometric probability,                     
              interacting particle systems and queueing theory.  Problems of                 
              multifractals and Hausdorf dimension of sets of Lebesgue measure               
              zero are to be studied.                                                        
                   This award provides support for graduate students.  The                   
              award will help develop the infrastructure of basic mathematical               
              research in the area of statistics and probability.
