Abstract    :
              A research program to obtain a more detailed understanding of                  
              charge-density-wave (CDW) phenomena and to exploit the long-                   
              recognized potential of CDW systems as models for nonlinear many               
              degrees-of-freedom dynamics is proposed.  The projects to be                   
              investigated include:  CDW phase slip at electrical contacts,                  
              including the effects of strains required for phase slip; the                  
              effects of impurities on vortex nucleation and growth; the dynamics            
              of CDW shear; the exploration of the analogies with other stick-               
              slip processes; the thermal CDW depinning and analogies with                   
              thermally-assisted flux flow; the direct imaging of CDW structure              
              and motion by transmission electron microscopy (TEM); and the                  
              finite-size effects in CDW dynamics.
