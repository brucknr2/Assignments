Abstract    :
              The objective are to develop a body of knowledge                               
              in methodology and analytical tools for on-line                                
              tracking of the synchronous machine parameters                                 
              and turns ratio of stator and field windings from                              
              the standpoint of system identification.  The                                  
              significance of this research is that engineers at                             
              utility companies can use the proposed estimation                              
              technique to identify the machine parameters for                               
              use in power systems planning and stability studies.                           
              Furthermore, by tracking the machine parameters                                
              and turns ratio of stator and field windings, the                              
              incipient faults of synchronous machines can be                                
              detected in real-time.  The on-line detection of                               
              imminent failure will facilitate orderly shut-down of                          
              the generator for repair.  In addition, by avoiding                            
              forced outage, the control power system is assured.                            
              Finally, the results of this research can be used by                           
              power system control engineers to accurately                                   
              predict and control the dynamic performance of                                 
              electronically controlled future power systems.
