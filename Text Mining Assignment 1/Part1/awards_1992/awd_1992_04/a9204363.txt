Abstract    :
              This grant is to support the travel of six US researchers in                   
              unification theory to the Annual Unification Workshop to be                    
              held in the Dagstuhl International Conference and Research                     
              Center in Dagstuhl, Germany.  The grant would fund only                        
              airfare, as all other funding is provided by the Center.                       
              There has been little interaction between the American and                     
              European researcher in unification theory although there is a                  
              great deal of important work in this area taking place on both                 
              sides of the Atlantic. This grant will bridge this gap, and                    
              bring together the two communities in order to share our                       
              knowledge and foster continued cooperation.
