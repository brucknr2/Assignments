Abstract    :
                   High accuracy calculations of parity forbidden transition                 
              amplitudes in heavy, many--electron atoms are undertaken to                    
              provide a test of radiative corrections to the Standard Model.                 
              The corrections are insensitive to the presently unknown mass                  
              of the top quark, which allows a sensitive probe of the new                    
              physics.  Many body perturbation theory and coupled cluster                    
              techniques, including triple excitations are required to                       
              perform the calculations to an accuracy of .1% in the Cs atom.                 
              In addition, a calculation of the screened Lamb shift in                       
              highly charged ions will be undertaken in order to provide                     
              information to compare with experimental QED radiative                         
              corrections in few valence electron atomic systems.
