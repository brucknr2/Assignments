Abstract    :
                   This project involves mathematical modeling of                            
              electromagnetic and elastic materials.  These materials are                    
              characterized by equilibrium configurations exhibiting multiple                
              phases.  Examples include elastic ferromagnets and rigid                       
              superconductors.  The basic modeling tools will be the use of                  
              spatially nonlocal energy terms to penalize oscillations in                    
              classical states and the variance of Young-measure states.  Also               
              included are existence results for short time dynamics of                      
              materials satisfying a generalized strong ellipticity hypothesis               
              on electromagnetic and elastic properties and existence of                     
              equilibrium solutions for elastic bodies with perfect                          
              diamagnetism (elastic superconductors.)                                        
                   These studies will lead to a better understanding of the                  
              mechanical properties of elastic and electromagnetic materials                 
              and composites and will have an impact on the development and                  
              synthesis of materials with optimal properties.
