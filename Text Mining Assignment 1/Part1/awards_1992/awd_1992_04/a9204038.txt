Abstract    :
                   The proposed research is related to several areas of                      
              probability theory: the theory of symmetric diffusion processes                
              and Dirichlet forms, stochastic differential geometry, and the                 
              analysis of heat kernels.  The principal investigator plans to                 
              extend the results of Carmona and Zheng about the small time                   
              asymptotics of the probability that Brownian paths visiting the                
              sets of a given finite sequence.  These extensions will be used                
              to solve several questions: the monotonicity of heat kernels                   
              associated to Newmann boundary conditions (Chavel's conjecture)                
              for all times, the study of Riemannian manifolds with piecewise                
              constant metrics via the precise path behavior of Brownian                     
              motions on these manifolds, and the study of general non-smooth                
              Riemannian manifolds and in particular the Harnack's inequality                
              by using the above concrete results and weak convergence.                      
                   There have been a lot of studies about the propagation of                 
              heat on some geometric body with smooth surfaces made by some                  
              unitary material.  The situation becomes more complicated when                 
              the surface is not smooth or the body is made with materials of                
              different thermal conductivities.  This research is aimed at a                 
              microscopic analysis of the latter case using probability theory.
