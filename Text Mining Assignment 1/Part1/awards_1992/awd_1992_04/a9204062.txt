Abstract    :
              The Principal Investigator will organize U.S. participation in a               
              joint U.S.-French workshop on underwater robotics. The workshop                
              will be held May 17 to 19, 1992, in Toulon, France.  The French                
              co-organizers have agreed to host the meeting at the Toulon                    
              laboratory of IFREMER, the French Agency responsible for ocean                 
              related research activities.  Fifteen U.S. participants, selected              
              to represent a wide range of underwater technology experience and              
              research interests, will discuss and report on potential areas                 
              for joint U.S.-French collaborative research.  The goal will be                
              to identify research areas which are important to underwater                   
              robots; interesting as research topics; and in which the French                
              and U.S. interests match sufficiently that the workshop                        
              participants believe substantial collaboration would be possible               
              and beneficial.  This report will be published in order to form                
              the catalyst for U.S. researchers to propose and initiate joint                
              projects with the French counterparts.
