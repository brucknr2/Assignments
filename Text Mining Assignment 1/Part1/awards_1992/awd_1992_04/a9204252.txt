Abstract    :
                   This award supports basic research in nuclear theory.                     
              Professors Chandler and Gibson are developing techniques to                    
              apply their formal theory of multiparticle scattering to                       
              realistic three body problems.  In particular, the problem of                  
              incorporating Coulomb interactions properly will be                            
              investigated.
