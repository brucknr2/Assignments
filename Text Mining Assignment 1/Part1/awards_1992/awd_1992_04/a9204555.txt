Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This project involves four comparative case studies of illness                 
              beliefs.  The researchers will study how local groups                          
              conceptualize a range of "traditional" illnesses in Guatemala,                 
              Mexico, among Mexican-Americans in Texas, and Puerto Ricans in                 
              Connecticut.  Using a model of cultural consensus to compare                   
              beliefs within and between sites, the project will advance our                 
              theoretical and methodological understanding of how local groups               
              share "folk" knowledge of illness.                                             
                                                                                             
              This research is important because the Hispanic segment of US                  
              society is growing faster than any other group.  Increased                     
              understanding of folk knowledge and beliefs about disease will be              
              useful to health care providers.  The project will also                        
              contribute to our general understanding of how knowledge is                    
              shared in small groups.
