Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This research will investigate the morphogenesis of the larval                 
              head of Drosophila. Mechanisms for the establishment of the                    
              pattern of head segmentation at blastoderm stage and early                     
              embryonic development of the head will be investigated,                        
              specifically with regard to the action of the CNC gene of                      
              Drosophila, which is expressed in three head segments. This work               
              will characterize the genetic controls activating CNC expression               
              in the proper segments, analyze the effects of loss of and of                  
              ubiquitous over expression of CNC function on embryonic                        
              development and investigate the possible DNA-binding activity of               
              the CNC protein. This work will also characterize a set of                     
              mutants that affect the principal process of head morphogenesis,               
              head involution, which occurs after the initial pattern is                     
              established, by using the expression of CNC and Dfd to follow                  
              specific segments in the abnormal morphogenetic movements of                   
              these mutants. This research will provide additional insight into              
              how genes interact during pattern formation in development and                 
              what role they play in the control of the morphogenetic movements              
              that manifest that initial pattern.
