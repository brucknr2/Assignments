Abstract    :
              The principal investigator will study three important questions in             
              mineral physics: Does crystal growth rate change abruptly at a                 
              critical size as elastic strain energy increases? What factors most            
              affect grain boundary diffusion rates in monomineralic aggregates?             
              What energies are associated with dislocations in minerals, and to             
              what extent do these affect mineral transformations? All of these              
              studies are important if we are to have fundamental understanding              
              of mineral behavior.
