Abstract    :
              This grant from the Organic Dynamics Program supports the work                 
              of Professor Stuart W. Staley at Carnegie Mellon University.                   
              Dynamic processes in bicyclooctatetraenyl dianions will be                     
              examined by nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy.  The                      
              activation barriers for bond shifting and charge transfer will                 
              be determined by complete line shape analysis, saturation                      
              transfer, or by other NMR methods.  The difference between                     
              these values will be equated to "pure" charge transfer in the                  
              absence of any major conformational change.  These charge                      
              transfer rates are related to electronic coupling under                        
              conditions of solvent-separated ion pairing and cation transfer                
              under conditions of contact ion pairing.  The rates will be                    
              measured as functions of the identities of the bridging group,                 
              cation, and solvent.                                                           
              %%%                                                                            
              Electron transfer from ring to ring in compounds containing two                
              rings separated by spacer groups will be examined.  These                      
              studies will be conducted under conditions in which a                          
              positively charged species (a cation) is and is not tightly                    
              associated with the electron-rich ring.  The rate at which the                 
              electrons transfer as a function of spacer group connecting the                
              two rings will provide valuable information on the ability of                  
              the spacer to act as a conduit for electron transfer.  The                     
              effect of solvent on the electron transfer will also be                        
              examined.
