Abstract    :
                   The principal investigator will continue his research in                  
              geometry and dynamical systems. One of the main parts of the                   
              research will extend verification of the Feigenbaum universality               
              conjecture to all real exponent singularities. He will also                    
              continue to develop the Chern-Weil theory for measurable                       
              conformal structures. A third project involves a lamination                    
              theory for Riemann surfaces which may lead to a universal                      
              Teichmuller theory modeled on Hilbert space.                                   
                   This award will support research in the general area of                   
              differential geometry and global analysis. Differential geometry               
              is the study of the relationship between the geometry of a space               
              and analytic concepts defined on the space. Global analysis is                 
              the study of the overall geometric and topological properties of               
              a space by piecing together local information. Applications of                 
              these areas of mathematics in other sciences include the                       
              structure of complicated molecules, liquid-gas boundaries, and                 
              the large scale structure of the universe.
