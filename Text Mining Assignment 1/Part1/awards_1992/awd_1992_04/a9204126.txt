Abstract    :
                   This research is concerned with the study of real and complex             
              forms by means of a natural inner product.  The principal                      
              investigator will examine sums of even powers of forms; spherical              
              designs; sums of powers of complex linear forms; sums of cubes of              
              linear forms; inequalities for products of forms; and symmetric                
              forms.                                                                         
                   The research supported involves the theory of forms.  This is             
              the study of homogeneous polynomials over the real numbers or over             
              the complex numbers.  The study of real and complex forms has deep             
              interrelations with linear algebra, combinatorics, number theory,              
              algebraic geometry, functional analysis and numerical analysis.
