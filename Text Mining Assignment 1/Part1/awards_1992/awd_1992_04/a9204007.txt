Abstract    :
                   This research examines the roles of first-order saturated,                
              supersaturated and minimal level change designs in the problem of              
              minimizing the number of experiments required to differentiate                 
              the influential factors from those only contributing noise.                    
                   Optimal experimental design in an industrial setting may                  
              also have as an objective the minimization of the number of                    
              experiments.  Theoretical solutions have often depended upon                   
              unrealistic assumptions about the likely number of influential                 
              factors and their interactions.  This research focuses on an                   
              efficient and effective approach to the design of a minimal                    
              series of experiments to identify those factors with the goal of               
              predicting the optimal combination of factors or factor settings               
              for full-scale production.
