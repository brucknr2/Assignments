Abstract    :
                   This research assesses the response of eolian geomorphic                  
              systems in the Mojave Desert to climatic changes during the Late               
              Pleistocene and Holocene (~the last 50,000 yr) as an example of the            
              geologic record of the effects of global change on desert regions.             
              The history of eolian activity in the region is documented using               
              information from eolian sand accumulations and luminescence dating             
              of eolian depositional episodes and is correlated with parallel                
              records environmental change (e.g. lake level changes, vegetation              
              changes).  Wind directions and circulation patterns associated with            
              periods of eolian activity have been reconstructed from evidence               
              contained in eolian deposits and landforms; and the magnitude of               
              climatic changes required to produce significant eolian transport              
              and deposition in the region has been assessed through studies of              
              the modern climatology of sand and dust transporting events.
