Abstract    :
                   This research is concerned with the structure theory of free              
              and finitely presented lattices.  The principal investigator will              
              use the theory of covers in free lattices and certain infinitary               
              techniques to determine if there are elements b<c<a in a free                  
              lattice such that the interval a/c is the union of a/c and c/b                 
              and both the latter are infinite.  The problem of when a finitely              
              presented lattice is weakly atomic, and when it is of finite                   
              width will also be investigated.  An efficient algorithm will be               
              sought for deciding if a finitely presented lattice is finite.                 
              The conjecture that a finitely presented lattice of infinite                   
              width must contain a sublattice isomorphic to the free lattice on              
              three generators will also be investigated.                                    
                   Lattices are discrete mathematical objects with a structure               
              reflecting to some extent the structure of set theory or logic.                
              This very weak structure means that lattices can be found in many              
              mathematical environments.  It also means that problems are easy               
              to state, hard to solve and of a very general nature.  The                     
              results of this work will impact many areas of mathematics,                    
              computer science, the social sciences and business management.
