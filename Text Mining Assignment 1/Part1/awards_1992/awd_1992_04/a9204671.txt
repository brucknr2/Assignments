Abstract    :
              Part 1 of this research is a field-analytical and experimental                 
              study of the behavior of tungsten, molybdenum, and other selected              
              ore and trace elements in titanite-melt systems.  Experiments on               
              the partitioning of ore metals between titanite and melt as a                  
              function of oxygen will allow the PIs to:  1) test hypotheses                  
              concerning ore metal behavior that results from SRXF analyses of               
              natural titanites and other studies; 2) model the effect of varying            
              igneous titanite/ilmenite ratios on the efficiency of Mo and W                 
              partitioning from melts into ore- forming fluids.  Part 2 is on the            
              partitioning of elements between silicate melts and aqueous fluids.            
              Part 3 is a study of the halogen chemistry fO2 and depth of                    
              formation of the igneous rocks of the Lachlan Fold Belt (LFB) as               
              the start of a larger study of their theoretical ore-potential.                
              This study represents a start in the evaluation of the                         
              ore-potential, from first principles, in one of the best-studied               
              belts of granitic rocks in the world.
