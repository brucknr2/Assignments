Abstract    :
              The principal investigator will study the behavior of hornblende               
              in both vacuum and hydrothermal environments. Transmission electron            
              microscopy, scanning electron microscopy, electron microprobe                  
              analyses, and 40Ar/39Ar analyses all will be utilized in the                   
              investigation. The goal of the study is to better understand                   
              diffusion kinetics in hornblende, and to apply the results to                  
              geochronologic determinations.
