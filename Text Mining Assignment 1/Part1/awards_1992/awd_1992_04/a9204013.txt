Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  The goal of the MISETA (Multi-Instrumented Studies of                     
              Equatorial Thermosphere Aeronomy) initiative is to improve                     
              understanding of equatorial thermosphere aeronomy through studies              
              that combine continuous measurements from a variety of                         
              automatically operating instruments.  This project will cover the              
              Imaging Science Component of the MISETA program.  Boston University            
              will construct a copy of its CEDAR Class-I imager and operate it at            
              Arequipa.  Results from the imager will be analyzed in coordination            
              with other MISETA PI's to insure maximum science yield from the                
              topics listed above.
