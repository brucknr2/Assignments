Abstract    :
                   Shelstad will continue her work on twisted endoscopy for                  
              reductive groups.  This is a part of the theory of automorphic                 
              forms which she has been instrumental in developing, and is based              
              on the general representation theory of reductive Lie groups.                  
              It is also planned to develop Igusa theory for orbital integrals               
              on real groups.  The goal is to obtain results useful for                      
              multiplicity formulas for automorphic representations.                         
                   The theory of Lie groups, named in honor of the Norwegian                 
              mathematician Sophus Lie, has been one of the major themes in                  
              twentieth century mathematics.  As the mathematical vehicle for                
              exploiting the symmetries inherent in a system, the                            
              representation theory of Lie groups has had a profound impact                  
              upon mathematics itself, particularly in analysis and number                   
              theory, and upon theoretical physics, especially quantum                       
              mechanics and elementary particle physics.
