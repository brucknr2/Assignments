Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This collaborative project integrates key aspects of cytology,                 
              physiology, and biochemistry to resolve a major problem in                     
              developmental biology:  explaining the most fundamental growth                 
              process in fungi -- apical growth of hyphae.  Hyphae elongate by a             
              complex mechanism involving movement of wall-building vesicles to              
              the apex.  In higher fungi, vesicles assemble in the hyphal tip to             
              form a unique complex called the Spitzenkorper.  The Spitzenkorper             
              is suspected of playing a central role in apical growth, but its               
              exact function and mechanisms controlling its action remain                    
              unknown.  By correlation video-enhanced light microscopy of growing            
              cells, electron microscopy, cytochemistry, and immunocytochemistry,            
              the research will characterize Spitzenkorper organization and                  
              behavior.  Characterization of apical vesicles will allow                      
              determination of their biochemical roles in cell growth.                       
              Developmental mutants will be used to correlate Spitzenkorper                  
              behavior with hyphal growth and provide clues concerning the                   
              control of polarity and apical growth. //
