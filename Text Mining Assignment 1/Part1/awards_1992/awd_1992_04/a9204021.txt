Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Many scientific applications are currently structured as a                     
              series of computational steps, each of which is implemented by a               
              separate program with files being used to transmit data between                
              the steps.  In this project, an alternative based on structuring               
              applications as heterogeneous distributed programs is proposed.                
              Among the potential benefits of this approach are improved access              
              to remote high-performance machines, enhanced ability to interact              
              with the application, and increased flexibility for the                        
              applications designer.  These benefits can be achieved with                    
              little extra effort by using a system software infrastructure to               
              handle communication and heterogeneity transparently to the user.              
              The specific goal of this research is to develop new application               
              programming techniques and software support systems to facilitate              
              this type of structuring for scientific applications.  The first               
              part involves continuing work into adapting existing tools for                 
              this purpose using the Schooner RPC system, as well as                         
              investigating issues related to the construction of new                        
              application codes that can exploit these capabilities.  The                    
              second part involves determining appropriate characteristics for               
              a software system attuned to the needs of scientific                           
              applications, and then constructing such a system.  All of this                
              work builds on previous research involving heterogeneous                       
              computing.
