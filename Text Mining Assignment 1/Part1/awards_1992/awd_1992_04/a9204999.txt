Abstract    :
              The Theoretical and Computational Chemistry Program of the                     
              Chemistry Division is supporting research by Dr. Krishnan                      
              Balasubramanian of Arizona State University on the electronic                  
              structure of Group III-V semiconductor clusters and very heavy                 
              main group clusters, and also on the potential energy surfaces                 
              for the reaction of bromine or chlorine with gallium arsenides.                
              The work employs relativistic complete active space multi-                     
              configuration self-consistent field calculations followed by                   
              multi-reference configuration and relativistic configuration                   
              interaction calculations.                                                      
              %%%                                                                            
              Computational studies of the heavier elements, including some                  
              of great importance to the semiconductor industry, require the                 
              use of relativistic quantum mechanics.  This research involves                 
              such studies, using a very high level, computationally                         
              intensive treatment.  The reactions studied are those which                    
              take part in the halogen etching of gallium arsenide semi-                     
              conductors.
