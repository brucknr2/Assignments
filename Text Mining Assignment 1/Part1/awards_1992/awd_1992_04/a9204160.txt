Abstract    :
              /his award is made by the Office of Special Projects in the                    
              Chemistry Division under the Materials Synthesis and Processing                
              Initiative. This research will explore the relationships                       
              between the properties of molecular, colloidal and solid state                 
              rare earth selenides and tellurides. New organo-rare earth                     
              compounds will be prepared and characterized in order to                       
              understand the fundamental aspects of bonding in rare earth                    
              coordination chemistry. These compounds will be thermolyzed at                 
              low temperatures into both nanometer-sized clusters and solid                  
              state compounds in order to examine the unique optical and                     
              magnetic properties of these semiconducting materials.  Rare                   
              earth nanoclusters will be characterized by NMR and                            
              transmission electron microscopy to document the evolution of                  
              size-dependent structural, electronic and magnetic properties.                 
              Once the fundamental properties of these materials have been                   
              outlined, the chemical properties responsible for cluster                      
              stability and particle size distribution can be determined.                    
              %%%                                                                            
              This low temperature approach to rare earth chalcogenides may                  
              afford the possibility of isolating metastable solid state                     
              compounds which would be unable to withstand the high                          
              temperatures associated with conventional solid state synthesis.
