Abstract    :
                   This award supports the research of Peter Haskell (joint                  
              with Jeffrey Fox of the University of Colorado) on equivariant                 
              KK-theory.  Equivariant K-theory and the K-theory of crossed                   
              product algebras have played an important role in the solution of              
              geometric and topological problems associated with group actions               
              and with fundamental groups of manifolds.  Examples of such                    
              problems include many cases of the Gromov-Lawson-Rosenberg                     
              conjecture on the existence of metrics with positive scalar                    
              curvature and many cases of the Novikov conjecture on the                      
              homotopy invariance of higher signatures.  Kasparov's                          
              representation ring KK(G)(C,C) and its distinguished idempotent                
              have played a fundamental role in this program.  This research                 
              will apply the Kasparov representation theory with the intention               
              for contributing to the geometric understanding of the K-theory                
              of crossed product C(*)-algebras.                                              
                   This work in 'modern analysis' blends sophisticated research              
              in algebra, geometry, and analysis to examine the underlying                   
              theory of manifolds or surfaces.  This analysis is by way of the               
              action of the transformation groups of a space on a surface or                 
              geometric object in that space.
