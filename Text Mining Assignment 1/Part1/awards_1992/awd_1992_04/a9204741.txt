Abstract    :
                     Slices of oceanic crust (ophiolite) are emplaced into many              
              orogenic belts and most have unusually steep, inverted metamorphic             
              gradients at their base.  These inverted gradients are thought to              
              be the product of synchronous faulting and metamorphism but the                
              details of the mechanisms involved are still unknown.  This study              
              will examine the rocks at the base of the Oman ophiolite, one of               
              the best exposed and best known in the world, to determine the                 
              microstructural, thermobarometric and thermochronologic history of             
              an archetypical inverted metamorphic gradient.  The results will               
              have important implications for the tectonic evolution of all                  
              mountain belts that contain ophiolitic rocks.
