Abstract    :
              The purpose of this research is to study the physical phenomena                
              controlling the dynamic constitutive and failure behavior of rate              
              sensitive metals alloys.  A combined axial/torsional split                     
              Hopkinson bar will be developed and used to investigate the                    
              thermomechanical constitutive and localization behavior of such                
              alloys when they are subjected to multi-axial dynamic loading.                 
              Emphasis will be placed on examining the phenomenon of failure                 
              mode transition (dynamic cracking vs. dynamic shear banding)                   
              associated with asymmetric impact loading of pre-notched plate                 
              specimens.  A variety of high speed optical and thermographic                  
              diagnostic techniques will be used simultaneously to record                    
              mechanical and temperature fields during deformation,                          
              localization and failure.
