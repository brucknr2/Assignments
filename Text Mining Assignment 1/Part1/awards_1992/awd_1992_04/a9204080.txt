Abstract    :
                   The objective is a new understanding of the origin of the                 
              earliest Mollusca and related invertebrates.  Recent advances in               
              the study of sclerite-bearing animals from the Cambrian provide an             
              opportunity to investigate the relationship between primitive                  
              spiculose molluscs (aplacophorans and chitons) and related soft-               
              bodied phyla (annelids, nemertines, sipunculans).  These Cambrian              
              fossils appear to bridge some of the morphological gaps between                
              living phyla and to suggest how mineral skeletons might have first             
              evolved within the Mollusca.  We intend to obtain 18S rRNA                     
              sequences from living spiculose molluscs in order to test whether              
              aplacophorans are the most primitive living molluscs or are                    
              secondarily simplified.  Furthermore, we plan  to investigate the              
              crystallography of polyplacophoran plates to test the hypothesis               
              that chiton crossed-lamellar aragonite is different from and                   
              therefore not homologous to the crossed-lamellar structure of the              
              shelled (conchiferan) molluscs.  At the same time we intended to               
              compare the microstructures of molluscan spicules with a variety of            
              sclerites extracted from Cambrian limestones.  This work is                    
              expected to provide new insights into the early history of the                 
              Mollusca and the evolution of the Metazoa as a whole.
