Abstract    :
                   This research involves  the development of numerical methods              
              for time-dependent gas dynamics calculations in more than one                  
              space dimension. The goal is to develop methods that are based on              
              an underlying uniform Cartesian grid even when the geometry is                 
              complicated and the phenomena being modeled involves complex                   
              features with arbitrary orientation relative to the grid.                      
              Specific aspects include the development of better multi-                      
              dimensional finite volume methods on irregular cells generated by              
              an interface or boundary cutting through a Cartesian grid cell,                
              and the use of such methods in conjunction with shock tracking                 
              and composite grids.                                                           
                   Computer simulation of fluid flow is critical in                          
              understanding and modeling a wide variety of important processes               
              in science and technology. As just one example, modeling the flow              
              of air around an aircraft in flight is required in order to                    
              determine how well it flies and to design safe and fuel-efficient              
              vehicles. Computer methods produce approximations to the velocity              
              and pressure of the air at a finite set of grid points around the              
              aircraft, by approximately solving a complicated set of                        
              differential equations. Millions of grid points are required to                
              obtain a good approximation to the flow around a complicated                   
              object, stretching even the most powerful computers to their                   
              limits. The goal of this work is to develop more efficient and                 
              accurate methods to solve such problems, with particular emphasis              
              on better ways to handle objects with complicated shapes (such as              
              aircraft) and to model flows with complicated behavior.
