Abstract    :
              9204041  Watts  In this project, four principal investigators with support from 
              five separate institutions will study energy, momentum, and  vorticity budgets,
              and zonal volume and heat transport variability  in the Antarctic Circumpolar
              Current (ACC) south of Tasmania,  Australia.  A mix of moored current meters,
              seafloor electric field  recorders, and inverted echo sounders will be used in
              collaboration  with similar resources from scientists in Hobart, Tasmania.  in 
              this component, the PI will oversee the construction and deployment  of
              Inverted Echo Sounders for measuring the first and second  baroclinic modes of
              motion in the ACC.  ***
