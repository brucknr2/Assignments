Abstract    :
                     In Sonora, Mexico, a diverse and prolific record of magmatism           
              from Late Cretaceous onward overlaps two regionally important                  
              deformational events - Laramide compression and Tertiary extension,            
              associated with motion along the adjacent margin of western North              
              America.  This project will significantly expand geochronologic and            
              geochemical information across the complex magmatic belt by K/Ar               
              and U/Pb techniques.  Results will provide a framework for                     
              understanding Sonoran volcanism and its relationships to plate                 
              interactions in the southwestern U.S., Mexico and the Caribbean.
