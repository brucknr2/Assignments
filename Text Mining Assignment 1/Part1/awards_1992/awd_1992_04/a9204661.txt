Abstract    :
              The principal investigator will conduct an experimental and field              
              program on the development of calc-alkaline magmas. In particular              
              he is interested in the controls exercised during fractional                   
              crystallization of magmas in continental and oceanic crust, and the            
              role of variations of pressure, water content, and mantle residue              
              bulk composition on melt compositions produced in the mantle source            
              region of subduction zone magmas.
