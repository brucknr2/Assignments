Abstract    :
              The principal investigator will develop the new quantitative trace             
              element technique of laser ablation inductively coupled plasma mass            
              spectrometry. In addition, he will apply this technique to three               
              specific research problems. The work will be done in collaboration             
              with Dr. Joaquin Ruiz at the University of Arizona. Knowledge                  
              gained will also benefit undergraduates when Dr. Hollocher returns             
              to Union College following the grant period.
