Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The goal of the proposed research is to understand how pp60src                 
              functions to regulate structural and biochemical features of the               
              Xenopus oocyte. The nature of cytoskeletal changes caused by                   
              expression in oocytes of pp60src with constitutive kinase                      
              activity will be examined. The pattern of tyrosine                             
              phosphorylation in oocytes producing kinase-constitutive pp60src               
              is altered when such oocytes are made to reenter the cell cycle                
              by progesterone treatment. Activation of the oocyte's endogenous               
              maturation promoting factor (MPF) by microinjection of cyclin                  
              mRNA will be used to examine whether MPF is responsible for this               
              change in substrate pattern. Immunochemical and biochemical                    
              methods will be used to determine whether changes in pp60src                   
              distribution or modification accompany the change in substrate                 
              pattern. Site directed mutagenesis will be used in an attempt to               
              define the portion of pp60src which mediates the response to                   
              progesterone.
