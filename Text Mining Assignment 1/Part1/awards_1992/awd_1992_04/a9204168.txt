Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              An along axis profile of 3-D magnetic inversions for the Mid-                  
              Atlantic Ridge 31 to 35 degrees south, show low magnetization at               
              the mid-sediments and high magnetizations at the sigment tips for              
              three adjacent spreading segments.  This project will measure rock             
              magnetic properties to determine if the calculated axial                       
              magnetization low at the mid-segment, and the sigment tip highs,               
              results from thickened crust with weakly magnetized sources,                   
              average crustal thickness and magnetic strength, or normal                     
              magnetization but thinned crust.  With the rock magnetic data and              
              the finer scale 3-D inversions, the questions of to what extent the            
              hypothesized mantle plume depress magnetization amplitudes, and are            
              slow spreading centers near discontinuities strongly magnetized                
              because of fractionation processes, will be addressed.
