Abstract    :
                This investigation will have three major impacts: (1) Add new                
              algorithms and methodologies to the repertoire of computational                
              geometry techniques, including new approximation methods and new               
              algorithms that are simpler and easier to implement than existing              
              ones; (2) Formulate precise algorithmic versions of a large body of            
              geometric problems from allied fields, in such a way that the methods          
              of computational geometry can be applied successfully and so that the          
              community of largely theoretical computational geometers can be                
              properly exposed to the more practical applications of the field               
              (allied fields include cartography, computer vision, computer-aided            
              design, graphics, manufacturing, etc); and (3) Disseminate                     
              methodologies of computational geometry to applied researchers who             
              work in allied fields but who have been largely unaware of progress in         
              computational geometry, particularly since it has been construed as a          
              primarily theoretical instrument.  This third impact will be made              
              through discussions of research directions with contacts in industrial         
              research labs and through publishing papers for conferences and in             
              journals whose readership includes a breadth of engineering                    
              disciplines.
