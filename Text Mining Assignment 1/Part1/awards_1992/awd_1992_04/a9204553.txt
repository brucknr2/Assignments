Abstract    :
                This research is to study the extent and mechanism of lateral                
              heterogeneity in the oceanic upper mantle.  The method of                      
              analysis will be joint inversion of seismic wave travel times,                 
              geoid, and bathymetry anomalies to determine upper mantle                      
              temperature and/or compositional variations.  It is intended to                
              attempt to distinguish between the competing models of thermal                 
              and compositional mechanisms for lateral heterogeneity on a                    
              regional (500-5000 km) scale in the vicinity of mid-ocean ridges               
              and mid-plate swells.  The initial effort will be to incorporate               
              surface wave data into the joint inversion and apply the                       
              technique to the East Pacific Rise region.
