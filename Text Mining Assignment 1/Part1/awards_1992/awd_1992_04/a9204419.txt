Abstract    :
                   This research addresses optimal scheduling, resource                      
              allocation, routing and flow control problems in networks.  The                
              resource allocation and scheduling models incorporate issues such              
              as task priorities and deadlines, switching delays and network                 
              interconnections.  The principal investigators will determine                  
              optimal scheduling strategies for interesting classes of problems              
              and study the interplay among task priorities, switching delays,               
              service distributions and queue lengths under such schedules.  In              
              routing the PIs will investigate the nature of optimal strategies              
              under decentralized information, and determine how qualitative                 
              properties of optimal policies may be useful in the design of                  
              routing protocols.  In flow control they will investigate                      
              optimization problems that arise in the performance design of the              
              hop-by-hop layer of computer communication networks.
