Abstract    :
                   Przebinda will investigate distribution characters and                    
              matrix coefficients of irreducible unitary representation of                   
              classical Lie groups from the viewpoint of microlocal analysis in              
              the context of Howe's theory of reductive dual pairs, via the                  
              Cayley transform.  Use will be made of Howe's theory, microlocal               
              analysis, and Harish-Chandra's theory of orbital integrals to                  
              construct irreducible unitary representations of classical Lie                 
              groups, attached to nilpotent coadjoint orbits.  This attachment               
              occurs on three levels: associated varieties, wave front sets,                 
              and character formulas.                                                        
                   The theory of Lie groups, named in honor of the Norwegian                 
              mathematician Sophus Lie, has been one of the major themes in                  
              twentieth century mathematics.  As the mathematical vehicle for                
              exploiting the symmetries inherent in a system, the                            
              representation theory of Lie groups has had a profound impact                  
              upon mathematics itself, particularly in analysis and number                   
              theory, and upon theoretical physics, especially quantum                       
              mechanics and elementary particle physics.
