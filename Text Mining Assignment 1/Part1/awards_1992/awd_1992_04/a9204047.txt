Abstract    :
                   Ozone (O3) and other oxidants in the troposphere affect both              
              local air quality and global climate.  Photochemical reactions                 
              involving odd nitrogen compounds and carbon monoxide (CO) or                   
              hydrocarbons (NMHC) produce ozone, but measurements of these                   
              species are sparse.  The resulting paucity of data for air over                
              nonurban areas of the eastern United States and over the northern              
              Atlantic Ocean limits our understanding of the atmospheric                     
              chemistry of ozone and hydroxyl radicals (OH).  The PI's plan to               
              conduct measurements at the AEROCE (Atmosphere/Ocean Chemistry                 
              Experiment) site in Bermuda in spring/summer 1992 and 1993, when               
              they will measure various reactive nitrogen species and collect                
              grab samples for hydrocarbons.  Intensive experiments will be                  
              carried out for one month, than the instruments will be operated in            
              an unattended, monitoring mode for as long as possible.  Total                 
              reactive nitrogen (NOy) will be measured by direct                             
              chemiluminescence, and CO by IR absorption.  Carbon monoxide will              
              be measured continuously in both Bermuda and a U.S. East Coast                 
              site.  For communications and data acquisition in Bermuda, they                
              plan to use a PAM-based (Portable Automated Mesonet) system.  These            
              field experiments will study the fate and effects of pollutants                
              after they have left the North American continent, and support                 
              aircraft experiments coordinated by the Center for Clouds,                     
              Chemistry, Climate (C4), and the North Atlantic Regional Study                 
              (NARE).
