Abstract    :
                   Ji will investigate noncommutative differential geometry on               
              operator algebras associated with discrete groups, C*-dynamical                
              systems, and strict deformation quantization of a cotangent space              
              of a smooth manifold.  Central to this study is the construction of            
              smooth and dense subalgebras of the corresponding C*-algebras.                 
              Completion of the projects will enable Ji to elucidate certain deep            
              properties of operator algebras, such as a partial solution to the             
              generalized Kadison conjecture, a further understanding of the                 
              noncommutative Toeplitz index theory, and a new birth of certain               
              noncommutative manifolds.                                                      
                   The general area of mathematics of this project has its basis             
              in the theory of algebras of Hilbert space operators.  Operators               
              can be thought of as finite or infinite matrices of complex                    
              numbers.  Special types of operators are often put together in an              
              algebra, naturally called an operator algebra.  These abstract                 
              objects have a surprising variety of applications.  For example,               
              they play a key role in knot theory, which in turn is  currently               
              being used to study the structure of DNA, and they are of                      
              fundamental importance in noncommutative geometry, which is                    
              becoming increasingly important in physics.
