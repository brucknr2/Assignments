Abstract    :
              The principal theme of this research is the application of                     
              group-theoretic techniques to a wide variety of search                         
              problems.  The ultimate objective is to combine algebraic                      
              techniques with standard search methods to solve "hard                         
              problems" which are currently solvable by neither method                       
              alone.  This requires the interaction of three major research                  
              efforts: the study of efficient algorithms for performing                      
              fundamental group computations; the development of an                          
              experimental system for testing algorithmic ideas on both                      
              sequential and parallel machines; and the exploration of                       
              methods for representing search problems in an algebraic                       
              setting and tools for solving them.  The algorithms to be                      
              studied play a fundamental role in the development of general                  
              algorithms for computing with groups as well as for                            
              application of group theory to real world problems.                            
              Applications are diverse and range from isomorphism testing of                 
              combinatorial objects to the transportation problems in                        
              operations research.  Both algorithms and applications will be                 
              implemented in both a traditional sequential environment                       
              engineered to support experimentation with a variety of data                   
              structures and techniques, and, where suitable, on a massively                 
              parallel SIMD machine.
