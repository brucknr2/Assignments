Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              We propose that essential fatty acids are very important for                   
              hibernation and reproduction in mammals. The proposed research will            
              focus on fatty acid composition, uptake and utilization in the                 
              white adipose tissue and liver of marmots (Marmota flaviventris)               
              by season and will directly assess if one particular essential                 
              fatty acid, linoleic acid (18:2, n-6), is spared Beta oxidation to             
              a significant degree within these tissues during the hibernation               
              period, October to March. It is well known that linoleic acid is               
              very important not only as an energy supply, but also as the                   
              precursor for arachidonic acid (20:4), and perhaps is important for            
              changes in reproductive condition and thermoregulatory capabilities            
              during, and at the end of hibernation. As marmots are mammals, the             
              results from these experiments may be directly applicable  to the              
              human metabolic disorders. Several human pathological conditions               
              are associated with essential fatty acid deficiency. Consequently,             
              conclusions drawn from these experiments will enhance our knowledge            
              about the role of essential fatty acids in physiological processes.
