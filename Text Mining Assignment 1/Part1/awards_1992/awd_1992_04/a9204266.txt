Abstract    :
                   This award supports the research of Professor E. Izadi to                 
              work in algebraic geometry.  She will work on low dimension                    
              principally polarized varieties and their moduli spaces using                  
              techniques involving theta divisors.  Problems to be studied                   
              include questions on cycles in Abelian varieties in dimension 4                
              with rank greater than one.                                                    
                   The research is in the field of algebraic geometry, one of                
              the oldest parts of modern mathematics, but one which blossomed                
              to the point where it has, in the past 10 years, solved problems               
              that have stood for centuries.  Originally, it treated figures                 
              defined in the plane by the simplest of equations, namely                      
              polynomials.  Today, the field uses methods not only from                      
              algebra, but also from analysis and topology, and conversely it                
              is extensively used in those fields.  Moreover, it has proved                  
              itself useful in fields as diverse as physics, theoretical                     
              computer science, cryptography, coding theory and robotics.
