Abstract    :
              This research will continue investigation into the theory of                   
              fault-tolerant computation.  Of particular interest are                        
              devices made of a large number of elementary components each                   
              of which can fail independently of the others, with a certain                  
              constant probability.  The faults are transient:  they chance                  
              the local state but not the local transition rule.                             
                                                                                             
              A fault-tolerant computer of this kind must use massive                        
              parallelism.  The simplest model of a massively parallel                       
              computer is the cellular automation:  a homogenous array (of                   
              dimension one, two or higher) of identical, locally                            
              communicating finite-state automata.  The model is identical                   
              to the interactive particle system in statistical                              
              physics.  It is an important object of investigation in                        
              statistical physics and theoretical biology as well as                         
              computer science.                                                              
                                                                                             
              As the number of components that can fail increases it does                    
              not help to run two computers simultaneously (as it is done                    
              now in many critical situations), comparing their results                      
              periodically; indeed, faults will occur in both of them                        
              between comparisons with high probability.  In cellular                        
              automata, the self-correction mechanism must be built into the                 
              transition rule of the cells.
