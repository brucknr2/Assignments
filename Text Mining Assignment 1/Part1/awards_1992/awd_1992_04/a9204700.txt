Abstract    :
                   Late Tertiary, tephra-rich sedimentary strata                             
              widespread in the Basin and Range Province of the Western                      
              United States are markedly more abundant than older.                           
              Tertiary sedimentary strata, and have accumulated in fault-                    
              bounded extensional basins formed province-wide.  As a step                    
              towards better understanding the nature and regional                           
              significance of these tephra-rich strata and their                             
              associated basin, better control is needed on their age and                    
              geographical distribution.  Towards this end PIs will                          
              establish the sequence of silicic tephra layers in these                       
              sparsely fossiliferous Late Tertiary  strata in the northern                   
              Basin and Range, and will date selected samples.  The tephra                   
              will be characterized using trace/minor element chemistry of                   
              the glass phase, and size, and shape analysis of the glass                     
              particles.  For dating the layers PIs will use the 40Ar/39Ar                   
              laser fusion technique on sanidine and biotite, common                         
              phenocrysts in the tephra.  The results will also add to the                   
              understanding of time, frequency, and magnitude of silicic                     
              volcanism in the Late Tertiary of the region, and the                          
              tephrochronology will provide a fundamental reference                          
              framework for future structural, stratigraphic, and                            
              paleontologic studies of these strata.
