Abstract    :
                This research continues the development, implementation,                     
              testing and application of codes for both acoustic and elastic 3-              
              D finite-difference and pseudo-spectral modeling and imaging of                
              both earth structure and earthquake sources.  Applications of the              
              modeling include simultaneous simulation of both body and surface              
              wave data recorded on crooked refraction profiles, data recorded               
              in bore-holes, and whole-earth simulations.  Applications of the               
              imaging include migration of 3-D controlled source data in both                
              stacked and pre-stack form, and imaging of earthquake sources in               
              both time and space.  These capabilities will be used by oil and               
              mineral industries and by earthquake and tectonic investigations.
