Abstract    :
              The research activity under this proposal will consist of a                    
              combination of theoretical modeling and data analysis.  Its                    
              primary objective is to gain an increased understanding of the                 
              energetics and dynamics of the atmospheric region situated                     
              between heights of 50 and 100 km.  It will consist of an indepth               
              study of Polar Mesospheric Clouds (PMC), a phenomenon which is a               
              prominent manifestation of the energetics and dynamics in the                  
              summertime polar mesopause region near 84 km height.  New                      
              modeling techniques which we have previously developed for                     
              simulating PMC evolution and optical properties will be combined               
              with existing dynamical-photochemical models for the thermal and               
              compositional structure of this atmospheric region.  Newly-                    
              available satellite measurements of atmospheric properties will                
              be used to develop a diagnostic model of the region's thermal,                 
              dynamical and transport processes.  A second objective will be to              
              determine the extent to which long-term anthropogenic changes in               
              chemical composition of the lower atmosphere has impacted the                  
              thermal and dynamical structure of this region.  In particular,                
              we will develop both empirical and first-principles modeling                   
              methods to support our recent hypothesis that PMC is a relatively              
              recent phenomenon, an indirect result of rising levels of                      
              tropospheric methane.
