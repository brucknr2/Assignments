Abstract    :
                   Professor Galloway will continue his work                                 
              on rigidity phenomena in space-time geometry.                                  
              A fundamental tool will be the Lorentzian analogue of the                      
              Cheeger-Gromoll splitting theorem. Ramifications of this                       
              work are applicable to the Hawking-Penrose theory of                           
              blackholes and space-time topology.Further problems concern                    
              questions of certain (Cauchy) surfaces in Lorentzian                           
              manifolds.
