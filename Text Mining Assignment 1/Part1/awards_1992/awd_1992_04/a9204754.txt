Abstract    :
              The principal investigator will experimentally study the chemical              
              and physical controls on melting within the Earth's continental                
              crust. In addition to answering a number of specific scientific                
              questions, the results will be used to constrain the                           
              stoichiometries of important melting reactions, and to determine               
              the physical conditions required of various metamorphic lithologies            
              to generate large mobile quantities of granitoid melts.
