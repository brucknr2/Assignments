Abstract    :
              The goal of this project is to develop effective numerical methods             
              for solving complex nonlinear optimization problems.  The                      
              algorithms to be developed and analyzed follow two distinct but                
              related approaches:                                                            
                        - Sequential quadratic programming (SQP) methods; and                
                        - Barrier methods (i.e. interior methods).                           
              This research will concentrate on large-scale problems, direct                 
              treatment of sparse linear and nonlinear constraints, and the                  
              guarantee of superlinear convergence.                                          
                                                                                             
              The research on SQP methods will extend techniques based on                    
              linearly constrained subproblems and an augmented Lagrangian merit             
              function.  Topics to be considered include use of a reduced                    
              Hessian, use of exact second derivatives, strategies for accepting             
              inexact solutions of subproblems, and techniques for treating                  
              infeasible subproblems.                                                        
                                                                                             
              Work in barrier methods have already proved remarkably successful              
              for linear programs.  Much research remains to improve their                   
              reliability and to extend their application to large-scale                     
              nonlinear (and convex) problems.  Research in barrier methods                  
              emphasizes matrix factorization rather than matrix updating, and               
              can utilize the substantial body of research on factorization                  
              methods for machines with parallel and vector architectures.  We               
              propose both direct and iterative methods for solving the                      
              indefinite systems involved.
