Abstract    :
                   The PI will carry out a numerical study in realistic 3D                   
              geometry of the thermomechanical interaction of mantle plumes                  
              moving lithospheric plates.  The model consists of a rectangular               
              box containing fluid with variable viscosity.  he lithosphere is               
              represented by highly viscous fluid at the top of the box that                 
              moves with velocity Uo, and the plume is generated by imposing a               
              Gaussian-shaped temperature anomaly on the bottom of the box.                  
              Numerical solutions for the flow will be obtained using the hybrid             
              spectral-finite difference method of Christensen and Harder (1991).            
              The solutions will then be used to calculate topography, geoid,                
              and heat flow anomalies, melt production rates, and the chemical               
              and isotopic composition of erupted melts.  The models will be                 
              constrained by comparing these parameters with observations from               
              various hotspots, with special attention to Hawaii.  Questions                 
              include the origin of midplate swells (thermal vs. dynamical                   
              support), the effectiveness of lithospheric thinning, and the                  
              origin of the four-stage evolutionary pattern of Hawaiian                      
              volcanism.
