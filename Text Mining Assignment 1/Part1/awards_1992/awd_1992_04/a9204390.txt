Abstract    :
                   An important issue in the design of host-network interfaces is            
              how much protocol processing should be done in hardware (i.e. on               
              the network device) and how much should be done in software (i.e.,             
              on the host).  THis issue is becoming increasingly important as                
              improving network performance puts more and more stress on the end             
              host.  Recent work in this area has focused on moving one or more              
              high-level protocols from the host to the network device.  In                  
              contrast, the principal investigators propose to investigate                   
              another point on the design spectrum. --a chip that implements a               
              collection of protocol-independent functions.  The PIs have                    
              identified key functions that span multiple  protocols, and plan to            
              provide these functions in hardware.                                           
                   The chip, called the x-chip is an outgrowth of the PIs' work              
              on the x-Kernel--software architecture that supports protocol                  
              implementations.  One of the design philosophies of the x-Kernel               
              has been to identify tasks that are common to all protocols, and to            
              provide general software tools that support these tasks.  The                  
              x-chip takes this philosophy one step further by moving certain                
              aspects of the support tools into hardware.  The ultimate goal is              
              to integrate the network device and the network software                       
              infrastructure vertically.
