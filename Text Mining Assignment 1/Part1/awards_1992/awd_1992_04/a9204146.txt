Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  The objective of this research is the assessment of                       
              electromagnetic scattering from spherical aerosol particles                    
              possessing internal inhomogeneities.  A theoretical study entailing            
              an exact solution of the electromagnetic boundary value problem,               
              along with an investigation of various approximation schemes, will             
              be conducted.  In order to corroborate the theory, laboratory tests            
              of the model will also be made.                                                
                                                                                             
                   An aerosol model based on a survey of the physical and                    
              atmospheric chemistry associated with the formation of sulfate and             
              carbonaceous aerosols and their composites will be developed.  The             
              optical properties of composite particles provided by that model               
              will be used in a sensitivity study of the radiative properties of             
              the aerosol and of the droplets for which the aerosol particles                
              serve as condensation nuclei.                                                  
                                                                                             
                   As a final exercise, a model albedo of cirrus clouds that are             
              made up of particles possessing internal structure will be                     
              contrasted with cirrus models that employ spheres, sphere                      
              aggregates, and small crystals as cloud particles.
