Abstract    :
                   The principal investigator will study nonlinear phenomena in              
              which chaotic and solitonic behavior occur.  Topics to be studied              
              include Hamiltonian theory over non-commutative rings, algebraic               
              and analytical aspects of the D-bar method, solutions of                       
              algebraic equations using algebraic geometric methods, Painleve                
              equations and their appearance in the matrix models of quantum                 
              gravity, and generalizations of the hypergeometric functions.                  
                   Integrable systems and inverse scattering problems play a                 
              fundamental role in establishing links between fundamental                     
              physics and the way in which mathematical models are used to                   
              describe it.
