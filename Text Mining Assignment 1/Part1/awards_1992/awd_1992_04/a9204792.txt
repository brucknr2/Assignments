Abstract    :
                   This award provides one-half the funding needed to acquire an             
              electron microprobe for installation and operation in the                      
              Department of Geological Sciences at the University of California,             
              Santa Barbara. The University is committed to providing the                    
              remaining funds necessary for this acquisition.                                
                   The new electron microprobe is essential for the research                 
              programs of several of the faculty in the Department of Geological             
              Sciences in the areas of petrology, geochemistry, and mineralogy.              
              The instrument will also be made available campus-wide and will be             
              used by researchers in the fields of materials science and                     
              anthropology, as well as research students in science.
