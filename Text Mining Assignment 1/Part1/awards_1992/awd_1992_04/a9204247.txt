Abstract    :
                   Polynomial splines and their tensor products ar natural                   
              building blocks for constructing finite-dimensional estimates of               
              infinite-dimensional main effects and low-order interactions; and              
              the resulting analysis of variance decompositions provide an                   
              insightful tool for data analysis.  The corresponding theory,                  
              methodology and software will be developed in a variety of                     
              settings, including regressions with application to time series                
              and stochastic processes, logistic regression, Poisson regres-                 
              sion, proportional hazards modeling and modeling of multivariate               
              and conditional distributions.  Theoretical results will focus on              
              rates of convergence, both locally and in various global norms.                
              Methodology will be highly adaptive and computationally inten-                 
              sive.                                                                          
                   The overall goal of this research is to develop, justify,                 
              explain and make available a systematic extension of generalized               
              linear models used by many scientists in drawing inferences from               
              their data.  Expanding the kinds of models to include multi-                   
              variate data that includes both continuous variables and                       
              variables with only a few possible values should make this                     
              methodology still more broadly useful.
