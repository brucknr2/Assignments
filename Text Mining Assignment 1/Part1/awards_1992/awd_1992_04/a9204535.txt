Abstract    :
                   The principal investigator will study a variety of problems in            
              differential geometry and differential topology.  The main goal of             
              the research is to develop a deeper understanding of global                    
              topological and geometrical properties of surfaces in R3 that                  
              satisfy some nice geometrical or variational principle.  Particular            
              emphasis will be placed upon:  1.  The global geometry and topology            
              of properly embedded minimal surfaces:  existence theorems,                    
              topological obstructions, total curvature theorems, conformal                  
              structure, topological uniqueness, computation of the index of                 
              examples, extension of isometries, uniqueness of minimal graphs of             
              logarithmic growth over noncompact domains, area growth estimates              
              for ends.  2.  Global geometry of constant mean curvature in R3 and            
              hyperbolic 3-space.  3.  Computation relevant to problems in the               
              subject.  4.  Geometry of isotopy surfaces in R3.                              
                   A classical topic in geometry is the nature of surfaces of                
              minimal area having a specified boundary, the so-called soap film              
              problem, which can be illustrated by dipping a wire frame into a               
              soap solution and examining the film formed when it is withdrawn.              
              Ignoring gravity, such films are known to have Gaussian curvature              
              zero everywhere.  A slightly more general physical situation calls             
              for surfaces with constant but not necessarily zero curvature.                 
              Problems about such surfaces abound, and while natural and often               
              simple to state, they are surprisingly difficult and have inspired             
              the creation of powerful methods drawing on diverse areas of                   
              mathematics.  Such problems and methods are the heart of this                  
              project.
