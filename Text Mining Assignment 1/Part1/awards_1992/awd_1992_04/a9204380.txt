Abstract    :
                   This project will examine robust regression procedures for                
              multiple linear regression and for nonlinear regression.   In the              
              first case, methods will be developed for the exact computations               
              of least median of squares estimators.  The theory and                         
              computation will be extended to the case when responses are                    
              arbitrarily censored; and bootstrap methods will be used to                    
              generate confidence intervals.  In the case of nonlinear                       
              regression, the project will focus on determining the robustness               
              of MM-estimation, which has been shown to be robust in the linear              
              case.                                                                          
                   Predictions are often calculated from data using regression               
              functions, which relate the value of the observation of interest               
              to values of other features or attributes.  Traditional                        
              computations used to derive the regression function itself are                 
              vulnerable to fairly rare but quite aberrant single data points                
              (outliers).  More robust alternative methods reduce the impact of              
              individual unusual or bizarre data points; hence these methods                 
              should give more stable predictions.
