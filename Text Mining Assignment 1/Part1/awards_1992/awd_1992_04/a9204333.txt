Abstract    :
                   The principal investigator will support graduate students                 
              working on problems in the theory of random walk and in                        
              asymptotic likelihood theory.  One problem will be to find a                   
              relationship between the size of the largest step of a random                  
              walk and the recurrence of the random walk.  Another will be to                
              try to extend the asymptotic likelihood theory of Hoffman-                     
              Jorgensen to nonparametric and semiparametric problems.                        
                   This award provides support for graduate students.  The                   
              award will help develop the infrastructure of basic mathematical               
              research in the area of statistics and probability.
