Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The main goal is a quantitative understanding of the effects of                
              disorder and electron-electron interactions on the transport                   
              properties of electrons sprayed on to solid hydrogen.  The                     
              evolution of single-electron localization effects into the                     
              disordered-Wigner-Crystal state will be studied.                               
                                                                                             
              A Second area of study is the nature of superfluidity on disordered            
              surfaces that are progressively smoothed by coating with hydrogen.             
                                                                                             
              Reducing the dimensionality of a system usually introduces profound            
              changes in its character and behavior.  Studies of such changes                
              enrich our understanding of quantum mechanics and condensed-matter             
              physics.
