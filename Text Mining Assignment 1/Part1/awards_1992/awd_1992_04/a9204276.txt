Abstract    :
                   The research of Andreas Blass is in three areas:  (1)                     
              combinatorial set theory, particularly the study of cardinal                   
              characteristics of the continuum;  (2) logic of topoi, particularly            
              connections between geometric morphisms of topoi, the internal                 
              higher-order logic, and domains for denotational semantics; and                
              (3) game semantics for linear logic and related systems.                       
                   Set theory provides the popular way to lay the foundations for            
              all of mathematics, the best known systematic attempt to do this               
              being Russell and Whitehead's Principia Mathematica, dating from               
              the early days of the 20th Century.  Important foundational                    
              questions concern the independence and the consistency of the                  
              axioms used to establish set theory.  Zermelo and Fraenkel's axioms            
              (ZF for short) are one of the most convenient sets of basic axioms.            
              However, it has been known since the work of Kurt Goedel in the                
              1930's that no axioms for set theory can be complete as well as                
              consistent.  This means that no set of axioms can be powerful                  
              enough to prove every possible proposition or else its negation,               
              but not both.  Upon this startling theorem has been erected a rich             
              theory, treating possible propositions P such that either P or Not             
              P can be added to ZF without resulting in a contradiction.  Any                
              such proposition P is said to be independent of ZF and can be taken            
              as an additional axiom of set theory.  The principal technique for             
              finding such independent propositions is Paul J. Cohen's so-called             
              method of forcing and its offspring.  This is the circle of ideas              
              involved in and motivating a large part of the investigator's                  
              research.
