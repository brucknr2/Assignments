Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This research is concerned with the preparation and study of                   
              ultrathin magnetic films of high-spin organic polyradicals having              
              two to nine unpaired electrons.  These polyradicals, considered to             
              be superparamagnetic building blocks for a magnet, will be used in             
              the form of a thin film with a thickness of one to hundred                     
              monolayers.  Langmuir-Blodgett technique will be used to control               
              the structure and the thickness of the films.  The study of the                
              materials and their magnetooptical properties will be examined.                
              The results of this research will ultimately lead to the                       
              development of magneto-optical storage media that are erasable and             
              rewritable at high speed.
