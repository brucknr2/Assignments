Abstract    :
              This project continues research on iterative substructuring methods            
              and other domain decomposition algorithms for partial differential             
              equations.  These algorithms are iterative methods for the parallel            
              solution of very large systems of algebraic equations that arise in            
              finite element/difference modeling of petroleum reservoirs,                    
              computational fluid dynamics, elasticity, etc.  In each iteration, the         
              restriction of the given problem to each of many subregions is solved          
              approximately and data is exchanged between neighboring subdomains.  A         
              global problem, with few degrees of freedom per subdomain, is also             
              required to obtain fast convergence when many subdomains are used.             
                                                                                             
              The research will focus on analyzing, improving and implementing               
              several classes of domain decomposition algorithms, in particular,             
              those which are suitable for emerging massively parallel systems.  The         
              ultimate goal is to solve very large, ill-conditioned problems of              
              continuum mechanics for which traditional iterative methods are                
              unsatisfactory and for which direct methods are too slow and require           
              too much memory.  The underlying theory, which has proven central in           
              the recent development of these fast algorithms, will be further               
              developed and the ideas tested in systematic numerical experiments.
