Abstract    :
                     The tectonics of Southeast Asia involves accretion and                  
              amalgamation of disparate cratonic fragment and blocks over a                  
              considerable range of time.  The Hunan Block of South China for                
              example accreted to the Yangtze craton, but the age of attachment              
              is poorly constrained and estimates range from Precambrian to                  
              Mesozoic.  This project will examine Paleozoic and Mesozoic rocks              
              in the Hunan block paleomagnetically to determine prior positions of           
              thee constituent rocks and therefore to constrain the time of                  
              collision.  Results will be of utility not only in South China                 
              geology, but in understanding Southeast Asia tectonics.
