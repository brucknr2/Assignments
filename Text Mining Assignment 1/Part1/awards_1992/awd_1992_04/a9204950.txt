Abstract    :
                   Many problems in science and engineering share the common                 
              form that an unknown "signal" has to be restored from blurred                  
              observations on a known transformation of the signal.                          
              Mathematically this requires solving a (linear) system of                      
              equations, typically in an infinite dimensional space, where the               
              data only suffice to construct a noisy approximation of the                    
              transformed signal.  Solution depends upon the inversion of the                
              operator.  Studying this inversion problem in a Hilbert space                  
              setting can provide a unifying approach for constructing                       
              solutions, by exploiting techniques from spectral and harmonic                 
              analysis.  Then statistical aspects such as error analysis and                 
              cross-validation can be examined.                                              
                   A famous example of this kind of problem is the technique of              
              computerized tomography used in medical practice to recover an                 
              image of internal structures in the body.  Because in practice,                
              measurements are blurred by errors, and because only a limited x-              
              ray exposure is possible, measurement of the "signal" (in this                 
              case the attenuation of the x-rays passing through the body) is                
              imperfect indeed.  Still, very refined images can be                           
              reconstructed and are very useful.  Other well-known applications              
              are image reconstruction and all kinds of deconvolution problems.
