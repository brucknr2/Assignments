Abstract    :
                   Voiculescu will to continue his work in three different                   
              aspects of operator algebra theory: (i) normed-ideal                           
              perturbations of Hilbert space operators and entropic                          
              invariants of dynamical systems, (ii) II_1 factors of free groups              
              and the noncommutative probability approach to free products,                  
              (iii)quasidiagonal C*-algebras and approximation of algebras.                  
                   The general area of mathematics of this project has its                   
              basis in the theory of algebras of Hilbert space operators.                    
              Operators can be thought of as finite or infinite matrices of                  
              complex numbers.  Special types of operators are often put                     
              together in an algebra, naturally called an operator algebra.                  
              These seemingly abstract objects have a surprising variety of                  
              applications.  For example, they play a key role in knot theory,               
              which in turn is  currently being used to study the structure of               
              DNA.
