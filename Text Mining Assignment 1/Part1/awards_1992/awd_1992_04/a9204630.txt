Abstract    :
              The project will investigate the area of                                       
              algebraic algorithms for symbolic computation.  Specifically,                  
              it will continue work on algebraic simplication.  This                         
              research will be on denesting nested radicals, and the                         
              computation for Galois groups.  The project will also study                    
              the relationship between polynomials and integers.  In the                     
              latter areas, the project will investigate such questions as:                  
              When do lower and upper bounds translate from one domain to                    
              the other?  The project will also attempt to develop theory of                 
              symbolic computation for floating point polynomials.
