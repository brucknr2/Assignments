Abstract    :
              This project is to explore column Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)                 
              architecture in the bit-serial computation and multi-chip module               
              implementation paradigms.  The architecture employs flexible                   
              routing structures to allow for a wide range of FFT transform                  
              lengths and to facilitate defect and fault-tolerance.  The object              
              of this project is to build a prototype of the proposed column FFT             
              architecture and demonstrate its performance and expendability on              
              real-time applications (using a 10 cm Dual-Polarized Doppler radar             
              system for real-time meteorological experiments).
