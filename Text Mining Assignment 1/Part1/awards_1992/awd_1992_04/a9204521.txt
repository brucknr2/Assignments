Abstract    :
                   Statistics for spatial data has important application in                  
              many sciences including astronomy, biology, earth, environmental,              
              atmospheric, oceanographic and elsewhere when spatial location is              
              important.  Image algebra was developed to provide a common                    
              mathematical environment for algorithm development for images.                 
              Its operands can be identified readily within a spatial statisti-              
              cal context allowing the strengths of both technologies to be                  
              combined.  In principle, spatial statistics can be used to                     
              analyze phenomena as patterns or objects; image algebraic                      
              operations permit implementation of such analyses.                             
                   For recorded phenomena as complex as patterns or objects,                 
              analysis depends on defining useful principles, in this case,                  
              spatial statistical principles which treat the recorded obser-                 
              vation as random examples of the underlying phenomena.  For                    
              example, in hazardous waste site characterization, efficient                   
              sampling and inference about the size, pattern and nature of the               
              contamination can allow efficient planning for cleanup.  The                   
              particular spatial statistical methods to be developed and                     
              implemented here are natural to use when the data are in the form              
              of images.
