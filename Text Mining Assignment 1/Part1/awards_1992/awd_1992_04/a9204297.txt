Abstract    :
                   This award is concerned with the study of certain                         
              invariants, known as local Chern characters, defined for modules               
              over local rings.  These invariants have been defined for bounded              
              complexes of free modules.  The principal investigator will study              
              the contributions of individual matrices defined by these                      
              complexes.   He will also consider questions concerning                        
              multiplicities and other ideal-theoretic properties.  The results              
              of these studies will be applied to homological conjectures and                
              to related problems.                                                           
                   This is research in the field of algebraic geometry, one of               
              the oldest parts of modern mathematics, but one which has had a                
              revolutionary flowering in the past quarter-century.  In its                   
              origins, it treated figures that could be defined in the plane by              
              the simplest equations, namely polynomials.  Nowadays, the field               
              makes use of methods not only from algebra, but from analysis and              
              topology, and conversely is finding application in those fields                
              as well as in theoretical computer science and robotics.
