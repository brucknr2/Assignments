Abstract    :
                   This proposal is to provide data-recording equipment for a                
              fourth magnetometer to be deployed as part of the MAGIC                        
              magnetometer array as well as to supply spare parts for the                    
              continued service and operations of the other systems in the array.            
              Such equipment is critical to the science program to be funded                 
              under the complementary proposed program from the University of                
              Michigan on "Continuing Operation of a Magnetometer Array on the               
              Greenland Ice Cap (MAGIC) to Investigate Propagating Ionospheric               
              Current Systems."  Since SRI provided the systems for the present              
              stations, it is most efficient that they provide equipment for the             
              final station to be deployed during the 1992 summer field season.              
              The apparatus includes the following: (1) very low power                       
              microcomputer with interface to handle the analogue magnetometer               
              signals, (2) large, low power consumption static random access                 
              memory, (3) clock providing 1 ms timing precision from Omega system            
              VLF broadcast signals, and (4) power supply and conversion                     
              equipment.  The system is packaged in a heavily insulated container            
              to provide environmental protection for the computer system which              
              self-heats the enclosure.  Data is stored in the static RAM for                
              later interrogation by the experimentor with a memoary sufficient              
              to store up to one year of 15-s averaged data.
