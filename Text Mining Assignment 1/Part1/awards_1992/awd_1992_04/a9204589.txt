Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This project combines theoretical and experimental studies of grain            
              boundary structure and properties, particularly as related to                  
              polycrystalline aggregates.  Attention is given to types of line               
              defects not studied previously in grain boundaries and to the                  
              effects of finite grain boundary length.  Computer-based                       
              experiments examine the effects of finite boundary size upon                   
              boundary structure with relevance to nanocrystalline materials.                
              The nature and behavior of triple lines and associated defects                 
              (disclinations) are studied using computational techniques for the             
              analysis of their geometries and experiments on copper tricrystals.            
              Experiments are aimed at determining energy vs. misorientation                 
              relationships for grain boundaries in non-cubic  materials.                    
              Transmission electron microscopy of tricrystals is employed to                 
              determine defect structure and grain boundary energies in selected             
              metal specimens.                                                               
              %%%                                                                            
              This project has as an overall goal to develop detailed                        
              understanding of the mechanisms by which grain boundary structure              
              determines grain boundary properties.  This is pertinent to all                
              polycrystalline materials, but is particularly relevant to the new             
              class of nanostructured materials now seeing increased research                
              attention.
