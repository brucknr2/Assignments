Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The decision of multipotential cells to adopt a myogenic program               
              of development is controlled by a family of related proteins.                  
              This family has been greatly conserved in evolution, and                       
              Drosophila has a gene (nautilus) with extensive homology to these              
              myogenic regulatory factors. nautilus is expressed is a temporal               
              and spatial pattern consistent with a role in early myogenesis,                
              and examination of its pattern of expression in a variety of                   
              mutant backgrounds has provided insight into the myogenic                      
              process. The proposed experiments are designed to utilize the                  
              unique features that Drosophila provides in an effort to better                
              understand the role of this protein in muscle development. These               
              will include 1) generation and characterization of a nautilus                  
              mutation, 2) molecular analysis of sequences necessary for rescue              
              of the mutant phenotype, and 3) identification of nautilus                     
              targets. Dr. Abmayr has recently generated a genetic deficiency                
              that removes the nautilus gene, which will be used to generate a               
              null allele of nautilus. The mutant phenotype of this deficiency               
              is characterized by dramatic deformities in the development of                 
              the musculature, consistent with the possibility that nautilus                 
              plays a critical role in this process. Dr. Abmayr will utilize P-              
              element mediated transformation of Drosophila to examine the                   
              sequences required to rescue the mutant phenotype. To identify                 
              the in vivo targets of nautilus, she will use an approach                      
              involving immunoprecipitation of nautilus bound in chromatin, and              
              the subsequent characterization of the bound sequences.
