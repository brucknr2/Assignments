Abstract    :
                   The principal investigator will study evolution equations in              
              differential geometry. In particular he will study the Ricci flow              
              and Yamabe flow. Singularities in the solutions of the flow                    
              problems will be one of the main focal points of the research.                 
              The principal investigator will try to use blow up methods to                  
              study these singularities.                                                     
                   This award will support research in the general area of                   
              differential geometry and global analysis. Differential geometry               
              is the study of the relationship between the geometry of a space               
              and analytic concepts defined on the space. Global analysis is                 
              the study of the overall geometric and topological properties of               
              a space by piecing together local information. Applications of                 
              these areas of mathematics in other sciences include the                       
              structure of complicated molecules, liquid-gas boundaries, and                 
              the large scale structure of the universe.
