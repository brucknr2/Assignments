Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The study proposes to develop a diagnostic test for the                        
              verification and validation of the origin of warm episodes in                  
              Earth's history. An isotopic approach will be applied to the                   
              Cenozoic record to understand the mechanisms responsible for                   
              changes in the polar temperatures. Latitudinal oxygen-isotopic                 
              profiles from planktonic foraminifera will provide independent                 
              tests for the validity of changes in deep-water circulation and/or             
              varying trace gas concentrations as mechanisms for the climatic                
              shifts from the warm Eocene to the glacial-interglacial cycles of              
              Plio-Pleistocene.
