Abstract    :
              The objectives of the proposed program are (1) to generate                     
              relatively monodispersed nanoparticles containing Fe and Cr by                 
              laser-induced gas-phase particle formation processes, (2) to                   
              effectively remove particles by a surface discharge/liquid                     
              nitrogen electrode assembly , (3) to consolidate nanoparticles                 
              into nanophase composites and measure their enhanced                           
              magnetocaloric effect under varying external magnetic field,                   
              and (4) to compare the experimental data with theory for                       
              maximum magnetocaloric refrigerating capacity.                                 
                                                                                             
              Three techniques are used for the generation of nanometer-                     
              sized particles:  laser ablation, photolytic dissociation, and                 
              pyrolysis.  For both the laser ablation and photolytic                         
              dissociation experiments, excimer lasers operating in the                      
              ultraviolet frequency range will be used.  The reaction                        
              chamber configuration, gas pressure and flow patterns will be                  
              optimized for controlled generation of monodispersed                           
              nanoparticles.  The photolytic pyrolysis technique using CO2                   
              lasers will be developed for the eventual scale-up production                  
              of nanocomposite at high rates.  Using CO2 laser-induced                       
              pyrolytic process, the proposed new nanocomposite material may                 
              be prepared in large quantities for the construction of                        
              prototype magnetic refrigerators operating near room                           
              temperature.                                                                   
                                                                                             
              The creation of nanocomposite refrigerant particles by gas-                    
              phase nucleation processes and their consolidation into                        
              superparamagnetic materials with enhanced magnetic moments                     
              will result in significant materials with increases of the                     
              magnetocaloric effect.
