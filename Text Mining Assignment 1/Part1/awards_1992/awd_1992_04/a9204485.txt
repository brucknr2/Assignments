Abstract    :
              Understanding the feedback between volcanic processes and fluid                
              migration requires a truly interdisciplinary effort.  To promote               
              discussion of these processes among diverse earth scientists, a                
              Geological Society of America Penrose Conference, "Fluid-Volcano               
              Interactions", will be held October 4-9, 1992.  Participants will              
              include volcanologists, hydrogeologists, geochemists,                          
              geomorphologists, geophysicists, and others united by an interest              
              in volcano-related physical and chemical processes.  This award                
              will provide travel funds for American graduate students to attend             
              the conference.
