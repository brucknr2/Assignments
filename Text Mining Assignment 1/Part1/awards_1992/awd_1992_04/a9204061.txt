Abstract    :
              Total internal-reflection microscopy (TIMR) is a technique                     
              developed by the P.I. and his co-authors to measure absolute                   
              distances between a submicron particle and a solid wall, the                   
              potential energy profiles and diffusion coefficients.  An                      
              improvement of TIMR performance is proposed by exerting                        
              radiation pressure on the microsphere in order to expand the                   
              area of application as well as the method efficiency.  The                     
              TIRM will be used to study the motion and corresponding forces                 
              (steric repulsion, bridging forces) of a single polymer coated                 
              microsphere in the proximity of a wall.  The proposed                          
              techniques complements the surface force measurement approach                  
              in a specific range of application for colloidal dispersions.                  
                                                                                             
              This project aims to an improved TIMR technique, which would                   
              allow to study fundamental interaction mechanisms and                          
              stability problems in colloidal systems.
