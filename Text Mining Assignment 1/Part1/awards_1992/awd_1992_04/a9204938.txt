Abstract    :
                   Research will continue in the areas of nonlinear filtering,               
              Markov chains, and branching processes.  In nonlinear filtering,               
              approximations will be studied and comparisons will be made                    
              between various approximations.  For Markov chains on a general                
              state space, consistent and asymptotically normal estimates of                 
              the transition function are to be sought.  Large deviations of                 
              the estimates of the population in a supercritical branching                   
              process will also be investigated.                                             
                   Research will be done on distinguishing between the original              
              signal and interference when a signal has been received.  In                   
              addition, attempts will be made to estimate the probability                    
              structure of certain types of randomly evolving processes.
