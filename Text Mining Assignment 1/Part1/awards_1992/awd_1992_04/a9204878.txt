Abstract    :
              The Department of Mathematics at the University of Southern                    
              California will purchase multiprocessing computation servers                   
              which will be dedicated to support research in the mathematical                
              sciences.  The equipment will be used for several research                     
              projects, including in particular: simulating biological neural                
              networks, computing homological invariants of moduli space,                    
              interacting particle systems as models of catalytic surface                    
              reactions, nonparametric estimation of probability distributions               
              from incomplete data.
