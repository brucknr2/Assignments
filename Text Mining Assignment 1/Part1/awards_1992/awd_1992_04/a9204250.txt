Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The goal of this research is to gain an understanding of the                   
              surface molecular characteristics of selected copolymer systems                
              based on poly(dimethylsiloxane).  Composition profiles away from               
              the surface and molecular orientation of the individual components             
              will be studied as a function of the bulk chemical composition,                
              molecular architecture, and molecular weight.  Fourier transform               
              infrared spectroscopy, employing attenuated total reflectance with             
              barrier-layers, will be used as the primary method.  The data will             
              be compared with recent theoretical predictions on the surface                 
              ordering of diblock copolymers and established theories dealing                
              with the ordering of copolymers in the bulk.  The result of this               
              research may lead to better theories in this field and have                    
              important implications in many practical aspects dealing with                  
              surface-related properties, such as adhesion and lubrication.
