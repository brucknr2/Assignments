Abstract    :
              It is recognized that soil-structure interaction during strong                 
              earthquake ground shaking alters the response characteristics of               
              a structural system.  However there are no strong-motion data                  
              from instrumented buildings to confirm the validity of the                     
              soil-structure interaction analysis methods and procedures; even               
              though the effects of this interaction are now included in                     
              various seismic codes (e.g. ATC-3, NEHRP-1985).  Workshops held                
              between 1978 and the present have repeatedly included the                      
              recommendation to instrument a building for soil-structure                     
              interaction studies.  Although there are over 100 structures in                
              the U.S. instrumented to measure the effects of strong earthquake              
              ground shaking, there are no instrumented structures that would                
              allow detailed calibration and/or confirmation of the validity of              
              soil-structure interaction analysis methods.  The objective of                 
              this workshop is to plan for and to design such an experiment,                 
              which is being undertaken by the U.S. Geological Survey.                       
                                                                                             
              This action is for support of this initiative by the National                  
              Science Foundation.  The purposes of this workshop are:  (a) to                
              bring together a panel of experts to reach a consensus on the                  
              benefits and feasibility of implementing a soil-structure                      
              interaction experiment by instrumenting a building in a                        
              seismically-active region of the U.S., and (b) to plan the                     
              details for such an experiment.
