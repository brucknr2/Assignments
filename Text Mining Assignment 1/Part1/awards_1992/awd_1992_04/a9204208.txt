Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  The goal of this project is to develop effective numerical                
              methods for solving complex nonlinear optimization problems.  The              
              algorithms to be developed and analyzed follow two distinct but                
              related approaches: (a) sequential quadratic programming (SQP)                 
              methods: and (b) barrier methods (i.e. interior methods).  This                
              research will concentrate on large-scale problems, direct treatment            
              of sparse linear and nonlinear constraints, and the guarantee of               
              superlinear convergence.  The research on SQP methods will extend              
              techniques based on linearly constrained subproblems and an                    
              augmented Largrangian merit function.  Topics to be considered                 
              include use of a reduced Hessian, use of exact second derivatives,             
              strategies for accepting inexact solutions of subproblems, and                 
              techniques for treating infeasible subproblems.                                
                   Work in barrier methods has already proved remarkably                     
              successful for linear programs.  Much research remains to improve              
              their reliability and to extend their application to large-scale               
              nonlinear (and convex) problems.  Research in barrier methods                  
              emphasizes matrix factorization rather than matrix updating, and               
              can utilize the substantial body of research on factorization                  
              methods for machines with parallel and vector architectures.                   
              Researchers will use both direct and iterative methods for solving             
              the indefinite systems involved.
