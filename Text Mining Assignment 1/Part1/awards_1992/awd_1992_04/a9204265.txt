Abstract    :
                   Professor Teitelbaum will work on the p-adic analytic theory              
              of modular curves and its arithmetic implications.  He will study              
              higher weight invariants of modular forms, the arithmetic of                   
              Shimura varieties and the arithmetic of Drinfeld modular curves.               
                   This project falls into the general area of arithmetic                    
              geometry - a subject that blends two of the oldest areas of                    
              mathematics: number theory and geometry.  This combination has                 
              proved extraordinarily fruitful - having recently solved problems              
              that withstood generations.  Among its many consequences are new               
              error correcting codes.  Such codes are essential for both modern              
              computers (hard disks) and compact disks.
