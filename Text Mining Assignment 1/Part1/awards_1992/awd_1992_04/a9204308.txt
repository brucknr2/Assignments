Abstract    :
                   This project includes research into a broad range of topics in            
              computability theory (recursion theory) and into logic applied to              
              various areas of computer science.  Included in the first area are             
              investigations of recursively enumerable sets, several structures              
              of degrees of complexity from Turing to polynomial time, and the               
              proof theoretic complexity of some mathematical theorems.  The                 
              second area of research includes the analysis and development of a             
              source in nonmonotonic logic, concurrent programming models,                   
              resource bounded logic, and applications of linear programming                 
              ideas and algorithms to data structures and logic programming.                 
                   Both theoretical computability questions and more practical               
              ones are addressed by this project.  The theoretical ones are the              
              ones in what is known as recursion theory, which deals with a model            
              of computability knowing no bounds on time or space.  Although                 
              answers to such questions have the ability to illuminate practical             
              questions, they are really practical only when their answers are               
              negative, for it is a very strong statement indeed to say that                 
              something cannot be computed even when one puts no limits on                   
              resources available for the purpose.  The finer structure of                   
              computability theory is even more relevant to actual computations,             
              and various aspects of that will also be considered.
