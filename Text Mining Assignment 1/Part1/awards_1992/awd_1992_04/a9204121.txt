Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The objectives of the study are the evaluation of magnetic seafloor            
              spreading axis from near-bottom magnetic (NBM) data and various                
              methods of reduction of NBM data, including the 3-D magnetic upward            
              continuation from uneven surface.  The study will optimize the                 
              high-resolution information obtained by NBM surveys.  Existing                 
              deeptow data from mid-Atlantic rift valley near 25 degrees N will              
              be utilized for the study.
