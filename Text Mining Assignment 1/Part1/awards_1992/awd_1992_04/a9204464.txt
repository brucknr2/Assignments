Abstract    :
                   An REU Site will be initiated, to focus on training and                   
              research in theoretical atomic and molecular physics.  The                     
              Site will be held at the Los Alamos Campus of the University                   
              of New Mexico, in conjunction with the Los Alamos National                     
              Laboratory.  This Site is unique among those in physics in                     
              concentrating on theoretical research.  It will help correct                   
              the current lack of those receiving advanced training in                       
              theoretical A&M physics.  The resources of LANL will be                        
              available to the attendees at this Site.
