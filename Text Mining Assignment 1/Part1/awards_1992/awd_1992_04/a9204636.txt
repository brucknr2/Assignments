Abstract    :
              The principal investigator will test the hypothesis that partial               
              melting in association with caldera collapse, and especially                   
              resurgent uplift, has a profound effect on the chemical evolution              
              of silicic magma chambers. To do so she will study the Minarets                
              caldera complex in the central Sierra Nevada, which is ideally                 
              suited to the goals of the study.
