Abstract    :
                   This research is concerned with the arithmetic of function                
              fields.  The principal investigator will study Heegner points on               
              modular curves with a view to proving an analog of the theorem of              
              Gross and Zagier.                                                              
                   This is research in the field of number theory.  Number                   
              theory starts with the whole numbers and questions such as the                 
              divisibility of one whole number by another.  It is among the                  
              oldest fields of mathematics and it was originally pursued for                 
              purely aesthetic reasons.  However, within the last half century,              
              it has become an essential tool in developing new algorithms for               
              computer science and new error correcting codes for electronics.
