Abstract    :
                   This award will support a series of regional mathematical                 
              conferences in Southern California.  The meetings will convene                 
              twice yearly rotating between University of California campuses                
              and the California Institute of Technology.  The research focus                
              of the conferences will be the interface of several complex                    
              variables and partial differential equations.  Initial funding                 
              for these conferences was provided by the organizers'                          
              institutions in 1989.                                                          
                   Funding will provide travel for speakers outside the                      
              geographical area and for graduate students.  Others will pay                  
              their own expenses.                                                            
                   The meetings are scheduled for weekends; the last one                     
              attracted about 80 participants
