Abstract    :
                   This grant covers experimental Elementary Particle                        
              Physics research by a group at the University of Cincinnati in                 
              collaboration with other NSF and DOE supported scientists.                     
              The group will study quark and lepton interactions in a series                 
              of experiments at Stanford, Fermilab, and other accelerator                    
              laboratories.  These studies have the potential for unique                     
              measurements in both electroweak and heavy quark physics.
