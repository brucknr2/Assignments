Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Experiments on liquid helium3 will be extended.  In the extreme                
              conditions of lmK temperature and 9T magnetic field, they shall                
              study magnetically driven superflow, wave propagation of the                   
              spin/entropy hybrid and spin-polarization by means of a spin                   
              filter, all in the "Al phase".  In addition, a) a systematic study,            
              using fourth-sound techniques, will be conducted on the effect of              
              He4 on the superfluidity of He3 confined in small pores; and b)                
              they shall measure velocity and attenuation of the pure entropy                
              second-sound wave in superfluid He3 using an improved Peshkov                  
              transducer technique.
