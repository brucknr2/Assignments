Abstract    :
                   This research project is devoted to various algebraic and                 
              geometric aspects of the equations of continuum mechanics and                  
              mathematical physics.  The principal areas of concentration                    
              include the equations of linear and nonlinear elasticity, Lie                  
              algebras and quasi-exactly solvable quantum problems, the Cartan               
              equivalence method, bi-Hamiltonian systems, solitary waves, and                
              nonlinear dissipation.  Specific applications include: 1.                      
              Conservation laws, symmetries, canonical forms and invariants for              
              the variational problems of linear and nonlinear elasticity,  2.               
              The classification of Lie algebras of differential operators and               
              quasi-exactly solvable Schrodinger operators,  3. Canonical                    
              forms and integrability of bi-Hamiltonian systems, 4. Nonlinear                
              dissipation and normal forms for both ordinary and partial                     
              differential equations,  5. Equivalence problems from the                      
              calculus of variations, and 6. Existence and non-existence of                  
              solitary wave solutions to higher order model evolution                        
              equations.                                                                     
                   These research topics are relevant to the studies of                      
              important problems arising from fluid mechanics, elasticity, and               
              quantum mechanics.  Particular problems to be addressed include                
              the investigation of solitary wave solutions to certain model                  
              equations for water waves, classification and application of a                 
              new and physically important class of quantum  mechanical                      
              systems, understanding dissipation (friction and viscosity) in                 
              mathematical models of nonlinear systems, and the analysis of                  
              symmetry and conservation laws for linear and nonlinear                        
              elasticity.
