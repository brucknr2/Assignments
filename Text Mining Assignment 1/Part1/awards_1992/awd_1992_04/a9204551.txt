Abstract    :
                   This award provides one-half the funding needed to acquire a              
              cryogenic magnetometer and to construct a magnetically shielded                
              room in which to operate it. The magnetometer will be installed and            
              operated in the Department of Geology and Geophysics at the                    
              University of Utah. The University of Utah is committed to                     
              providing the remaining funds necessary for this project.                      
                   The equipment will be used primarily in the research projects             
              of the Principal Investigator, which are aimed at explaining the               
              origins and meaning of rock magnetism. The high-sensitivity                    
              magnetometer will make it possible to measure magnetic moments of              
              individual mineral particles in magnetized rocks and to study the              
              development of magnetic remanence in rocks under conditions that               
              mimic natural settings.
