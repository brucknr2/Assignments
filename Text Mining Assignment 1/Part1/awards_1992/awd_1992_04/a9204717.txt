Abstract    :
                 Studies on the self assembly of viral capsid proteins have                  
              served as a model system for intermolecular interactions.  The                 
              major capsid protein of simian virus 40 (SV40) is synthesized in               
              the cytoplasm of infected cells and is transported to the nucleus              
              shortly after synthesis for viral assembly.  The protein forms the             
              pentameric capsomeres of the SV40 capsid.  Vp1 pentamers are                   
              detectable both in the cytoplasm of infected cells and in vitro.               
              The nature of the interactions involved in Vp1 capsomere formation,            
              as well as the residues involved, are not known.  Cytoplasmic Vp1              
              pentamer formation is not only the initial stage of SV40 assembly,             
              but may also have a role in the efficient nuclear transport of Vp1.            
              Here, we propose to examine the chemical nature and the amino acid             
              residues involved in Vp1 multimer formation in vitro.  Results from            
              the proposed experiments will later be used to study the role of               
              pentamer formation in the transport of Vp1 to the nucleus.                     
              %%%                                                                            
              Due to the relative simplicity of its gene structure, simian virus             
              40 has been used as a model system for studies of virus assembly,              
              structure, and function.  The virus assembles in the nucleus of the            
              host cell, and thus it is also an ideal model system for study of              
              nuclear localization and nuclear localization signals.  This                   
              project will take advantage of these features of SV40 to increase              
              our understanding of viral assembly and nucleocytoplasmic                      
              trafficking.  In addition, the project will provide an opportunity             
              and a vehicle for undergraduate student involvement in biological              
              research.
