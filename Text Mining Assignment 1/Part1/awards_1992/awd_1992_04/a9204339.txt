Abstract    :
              The theme of this project is designing a computer architecture and             
              operating system that will support the natural evolution of machine            
              code.  The primary computational objective is to experiment with a             
              large number of variations on the successful architecture in order to          
              find the optimal balance of computational power and evolvability.
