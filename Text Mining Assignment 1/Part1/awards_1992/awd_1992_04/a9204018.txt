Abstract    :
              This research group will develop methods for mapping the                       
              composition of cell membranes and organelles at 2nm-3nm                        
              resolution, with a 200kV field emission gun ?FEG!-equipped                     
              electron microscope interfaced with a parallel electron                        
              energy loss spectrometer (parallel EELS) and an X-ray                          
              detector.  Physicists and biologists will collaborate to                       
              develop the special techniques required for quantitative                       
              imaging of low-concentrations of elements (e.g., Ca, P, Gd)                    
              in biological cryosections.  The major obstacle to EELS, the                   
              large background due to the thickness of cryosections, will                    
              be overcome by the use of 200kV excitation and through                         
              theoretical and experimental development of optimal methods                    
              of spectral collection and data analysis.  EELS spectra                        
              collected at each scanned pixel will be multiple least                         
              squares fitted with algorithms that take into account the                      
              contributions of plural plasmon scattering and, in the                         
              higher loss region, the carbon energy loss and its fine                        
              structure, and L-edges (e.g. potassium)to the EELS                             
              background.  Electron optical components will be designed                      
              and added to an existing parallel EELS system to correct the                   
              gain variations that reduce detection sensitivities.  High                     
              resolution compositional mapping of Ca-bound to membranes or                   
              sequestered in organelles and of phosphorylation sites will                    
              have broad biological applications and will be explored.
