Abstract    :
              The principal investigator will investigate the hypothesis that a              
              correlation exists between the measured oxygen isotope                         
              fractionations among coexisting minerals in felsic igneous rocks               
              and cooling rate of the rocks as determined by 40Ar/39Ar studies.              
              Samples will be studied from both fast- and slow-cooling bodies.               
              If successful, the resulting data would also provide a valuable new            
              tool for the determination of cooling and uplift rates in orogenic             
              terranes.
