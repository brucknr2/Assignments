Abstract    :
              This project involves the analysis of number theoretic                         
              algorithms.  Specifically, the following three problems will                   
              be studied:                                                                    
                                                                                             
                o  Determined explicity bounds useful in the analysis of                     
                   certain number theoretic algorithms under the assumption                  
                   of the extended Riemann hypothesis.                                       
                                                                                             
                o  Determine and precisely analyze the worst-case and                        
                   average-case behavior of some algorithms for computing                    
                   greatest common divisors.                                                 
                                                                                             
                o  Precisely analyze and compare several prime number                        
                   sieves, including Pritchard's sublinear wheel sieve.                      
                                                                                             
              Undergraduate students will participate in this research by                    
              helping in the design and implementation of algorithms                         
              associated with the last two problems listed above.
