Abstract    :
              This research project, supported in the Analytical and Surface                 
              Chemistry Program, will address the lifetimes and energy                       
              transfer mechanisms of vibrationally excited molecular                         
              adsorbates on semiconductor and metallic surfaces.                             
              Well-defined adsorbate-surface systems will be prepared and                    
              characterized in ultra high vacuum and in solution, and                        
              selected vibrations of the adsorbates will be excited by                       
              ultrashort IR laser pulses.  Evolution of the vibrational                      
              excitation will be monitored with coherent time-resolved laser                 
              surface spectroscopy methods.  Mechanisms of inter-adsorbate,                  
              vibration-phonon, and vibration-electronic energy transfer will                
              be explored.  The work will concentrate initially on the study                 
              of energy transfer in the H/Si(111) and (100) adsorbate                        
              systems, as well as on molecular CO adsorbed at electrochemical                
              interfaces.                                                                    
              %%%                                                                            
              The dynamics of energy transfer between adsorbed molecules and                 
              solid surfaces controls reactivity in surface chemistry.  This                 
              research project will explore the details of adsorbate-surface                 
              energy transfer, with the goal of developing an understanding                  
              of this process and its relevance to semiconductor processing,                 
              electrochemical systems, and heterogeneous catalysis.  Powerful                
              laser spectroscopic methods will be used to study molecular                    
              adsorbates on well-characterized semiconductor and metallic                    
              surfaces.
