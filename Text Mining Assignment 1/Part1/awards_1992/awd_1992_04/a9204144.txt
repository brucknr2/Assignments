Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              That study will show if micritization takes place by                           
              recrystallization in shallow water sediments. Micritization of                 
              Halimeda from shallow water platforms off Belize a Bahamas will be             
              studies through observation of skeletal alteration by scanning                 
              electron microscope, x-ray diffraction, energy-dispersive x-ray                
              analysis and microprobe analysis. The result could be as important             
              as the discovery of submarine cementation in the 1960s.//
