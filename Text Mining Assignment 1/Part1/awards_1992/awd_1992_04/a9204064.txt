Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This project will provide a scanning transmission electron                     
              microscope (STEM) and computer interfaced microanalysis system for             
              fundamental characterizations of advanced materials, including                 
              steels, structural and electronic ceramics, welding materials, and             
              surface-modified alloy systems. The STEM will have a LaB6 filament,            
              200 kV maximum accelerating voltage, 0.14 nm lattice resolution, a             
              scanning system with backscattered and secondary electron                      
              detectors, and a high resolution Si(Li) x-ray detector.  This                  
              instrumentation will make possible high resolution definition of               
              fine structure in materials, fine-scale micro-diffraction of                   
              phases, and microchemical analysis of the distribution of elements             
              in the various phases of the complex material systems to be                    
              examined.  This information is essential to optimize the properties            
              and performance of existing structural and electronic material, and            
              to design new materials and processes.  The instrumentation will be            
              housed adjacent to the scanning electron microscope and                        
              transmission electron microscope already in place, and will be                 
              schedule and maintained by the electron microscope laboratory                  
              coordinator now on campus.
