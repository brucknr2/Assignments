Abstract    :
                   This award provides one-half the funding necessary to                     
              modernize four older generation mass spectrometers at the                      
              Department of Terrestrial Magnetism of the Carnegie Institution of             
              Washington (DTM-CIW). DTM-CIW is committed to providing the                    
              remaining funds needed for the upgrade.                                        
                   The Department of Terrestrial Magnetism carries out research              
              projects in isotope geochemistry of the Earth's crust and mantle               
              regions. The research is carried out by in-house geochemists and               
              through a program of visiting scientists and research students. The            
              improved performance of the upgraded mass spectrometers will                   
              enhance the capabilities of this user group to explore new                     
              analytical techniques in solid earth geochemistry.
