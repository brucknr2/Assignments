Abstract    :
              In this Experimental Physical Chemistry project, sponsored by                  
              the Chemistry Division, Profs. Cross and Saunders (Yale                        
              University) will study reaction dynamics of chemiionization                    
              using crossed molecular beams. These include Lewis acid/base,                  
              Bronsted acid/base, electron transfer, and SN2 reactions                       
              involving large molecules of general chemical interest. A novel                
              feature of the project is the catalytic absorption of photons                  
              by transition state species.

              Profs. Cross and Saunders (Yale University) will use molecular                 
              beams and ultraviolet radiation to measure the rates and                       
              elucidate the mechanisms of gas phase reactions of general                     
              chemical interest. Many of these reactions are well known in                   
              solution but proceed by quite different pathways in the gas,                   
              where no solvent is present. The nature of reactive                            
              intermediates in these reactions has been difficult to                         
              determine and has generated much controversy. The successful                   
              use of light to directly stimulate reactive intermediates is an                
              important advance because it removes a major source of                         
              ambiguity.
