Abstract    :
                   This award in mathematical physics supports basic                         
              research into the mathematical foundations of statistical                      
              mechanical systems, quantum field theories and fluid dynamics.                 
              Multiscale analysis or renormalization group techniques will                   
              be applied to study solutions of incompressible fluid                          
              dynamics, represented by the Navier-Stokes equations.  A long                  
              term goal is provide a rigorous basis for understanding                        
              turbulence phenomena.
