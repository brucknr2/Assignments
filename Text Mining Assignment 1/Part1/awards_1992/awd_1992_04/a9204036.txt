Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The U.S.-Japan Workshop on Bridge Engineering is a meeting between             
              American and Japanese bridge engineers, which is conducted under               
              the auspices of the U.S.-Japan Panel of Wind and Seismic effects               
              of the UJNR program.  This meeting includes a two-day workshop with            
              technical presentations of the participants related to recent                  
              advances of bridge engineering and a study tour of bridge                      
              structures and organizations.  Seven meetings have been conducted              
              so far, and all of them have been proven to be a very fruitful and             
              productive experience for the participants of both countries.  The             
              Workshop will be held in Illinois in May 1992.
