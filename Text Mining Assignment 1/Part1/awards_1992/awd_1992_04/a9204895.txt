Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Development and evolution of the nematode male tail fan will be                
              studied. The long term objective is to reconstruct the                         
              evolutionary pathway that has historically been followed to lead               
              to diverse nematode forms. The aim is to identify and describe in              
              molecular terms the genetic events that underlie the evolution of              
              developmental programs. Evolution of the tail fan developmental                
              program will be studied by comparing the cellular mechanisms of                
              fan development in C. elegans with that in four other free living              
              nematode species. The fan is chosen for these studies because its              
              morphology varies widely among nematode species. Cells                         
              responsible for making the fan will be identified by cell                      
              ablation experiments in C. elegans. Development of the fan will                
              be studied by tracing cell lineages, defining the positions of                 
              epidermal cells by indirect immunofluorescence staining with a                 
              monoclonal antibody to a cell junctional antigen, and by direct                
              light microscopic observation. Points of evolutionary divergence               
              will be identified in the various stages of fan differentiation.               
              A phylogenetic tree indicating the evolutionary relationships of               
              the nematode species studies will be constructed from sequences                
              of the small ribosomal subunit genes. In order to identify genes               
              that may have played a role in evolution of the fan, mutants of                
              C. elegans with abnormal fans will be analyzed. Existing                       
              mutations will be genetically mapped to place them into genes.                 
              Phenotypes of the mutations will be described following the same               
              criteria used to compare the different species. In this way, it                
              is hoped to identify genes acting at the same developmental                    
              stages where evolutionary divergence has occurred.
