Abstract    :
                   This award will support the research of two individuals in                
              the area of statistical sciences.  Dr. Nandram will develop                    
              bayesian methods for the analysis of categorical data from                     
              similar sources.  Dr. Guo will work on three different problems                
              in the analysis of non-linear time series.  Together, these two                
              projects represent interesting problems in modern statistics.

              similar sources.  One example of categorical data would be "yes"               
              or "no" responses in questionnaires.  Dr. Guo will work on three               
              different problems in the analysis of non-linear time series.                  
              Together, these two projects represent interesting problems in
