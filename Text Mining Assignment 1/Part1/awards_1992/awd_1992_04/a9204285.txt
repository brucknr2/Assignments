Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Fundamental research to investigate the formation of silicide and              
              silicide-germanide films on coherently strained Si and Si1-xGex                
              films will be conducted.  Special features of the research are                 
              the ability to alter film-substrate strain independently of                    
              film-substrate interfacial chemical composition; the direct                    
              correlation of strain, independent of chemical factors, with                   
              thermodynamic and electronic properties of the film-substrate                  
              couple; and, preliminary studies of the chemistry and physics of               
              formation of silicide or silicide-germanide compounds from                     
              deposited metals reacted with Si1-xGexsubstrates.

              This research is expected to provide deeper fundamental                        
              understanding of basic properties of  thin films and interfaces                
              critically important to the functionality of electronic/photonic               
              materials and particular compositional and structural                          
              combinations and configurations relevant to devices and circuits.              
              From an application point of view, understanding these properties              
              and their relationship to materials synthesis and processing is                
              highly beneficial to semiconductor device design and fabrication.              
              The results will be of importance in a general way to the                      
              technology of large scale, high speed integrated electronic and                
              photonic devices and circuits.
