Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              More accurate meteorological data is required for many of the                  
              research efforts planned as part of the World Ocean Circulation                
              Experiment (WOCE), which will begin field experiments in 1992.                 
              Although many sensors are available commercially, their accuracy               
              and calibration for ships and buoys had not been tested until                  
              recently.  Work completed in an initial grant to the PI's (OCE-87-             
              09614) quantified the performance characteristics of some buoy and             
              ship sensors, and cooperation between the PI's and manufacturers               
              resulted in improvements to these sensors.  Development of a data              
              logging system that is applicable to any sensor was also completed             
              and licensed to a commercial manufacturer.  The improved sensor                
              system is known as IMET, for Improved METeorological.  This grant              
              provides funding for the final documentation of the recently                   
              developed IMET sensor system.  This documentation will allow the               
              rest of the oceanographic community to install and maintain the                
              IMET system on a variety of research vessels.
