Abstract    :
                   This research is concerned with the homological aspects of                
              finite dimensional algebras.  The principal investigator will                  
              examine several dimensions which measure the homological                       
              complexity of an algebra in order to obtain precise structural                 
              descriptions of higher syzygies, and to describe and exploit                   
              repetitive homological behavior.  There will be a heavy emphasis               
              on crossconnections to related areas.  In particular, the                      
              principal investigator will seek replacements for the Tarsy                    
              conjecture on the global dimension of classical orders over                    
              discrete valuation domains.                                                    
                   This research is in the general area of ring theory.  A ring              
              is an algebraic object having both an addition and a                           
              multiplication defined on it.  Although the additive operation                 
              satisfies the commutative law, the multiplicative operation is                 
              not required to do so.  An example of a ring for which                         
              multiplication is not commutative is the collection of nxn                     
              matrices over the integers.  The study of noncommutative rings                 
              has become an important part of algebra because of its increasing              
              significance to other branches of mathematics and physics.
