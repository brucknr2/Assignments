Abstract    :
              The purpose of this research is to obtain in situ temperature and              
              freezing depth data at the Town of Hubbadston municipal waste                  
              landfill, in Hubbardston, Massachusetts. The temperature profiles              
              in the landfill cover as a function of depth, and thus the number              
              of insitu freeze/thaw cycles the cover experiences will be                     
              studied. Samples will be obtained from the cover to determine the              
              hydraulic conductivity. The insitu change in hydraulic                         
              conductivity will be compared can be compared to the laboratory                
              change in hydraulic conductivity due to freezing and thawing.                  
              Such data is not readily available and will be of great value in               
              geoenvironmental technology.
