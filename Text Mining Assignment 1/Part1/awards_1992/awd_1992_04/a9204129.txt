Abstract    :
                   This project will develop and test methods by which existing              
              domain knowledge can be combined with large amounts of training                
              data to yield high-performance classification systems.  The                    
              successful development of such methods would address fundamental               
              questions in machine learning and solve critical applications                  
              problems in science and engineering.  In particular, the methods               
              will be developed and tested in the domain of ecosystem modelling,             
              where they may be able to provide more reliable estimates of the               
              effect of increased atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) on the                    
              geographical distribution of plant ecosystems (biomes).  Two                   
              approaches will be investigated:  (a) a theory-centered approach,              
              in which a partial theory of plant physiology is refined so that it            
              can predict biome distribution, and (b) a rule-centered approach in            
              a standard machine learning algorithm is applied to discover biome             
              distribution rules.  The rule-centered approach will use the                   
              partial theory of plant physiology to suggest relevant features and            
              to rationalize the discovered rules.  Both approaches will entail              
              the development of new learning methods including (a) constraint               
              reasoning techniques for the interpretation of data and the                    
              refinement of the domain theory, (b) constructive induction                    
              techniques for defining candidate features, and (c) rationalization            
              techniques for ensuring the consistency of discovered rules with               
              the domain theory.//
