Abstract    :
              The principal investigator will study skarns and the related                   
              metamorphic rocks in deposits of both the United States and the                
              former Soviet Union. The study is designed to determine the role               
              of three alternative models of metasomatism, and to better                     
              understand the development of ore deposits.
