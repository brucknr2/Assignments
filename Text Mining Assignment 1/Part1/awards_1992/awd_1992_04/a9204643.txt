Abstract    :
                This research is to develop the theory and a computer code for               
              readily available personal computers to calculate earthquake                   
              ground response for sites on the surface of a sediment-filled                  
              valley or basin.  The fundamental objective is the theoretical                 
              determination of the eigenmodes (eigenfrequencies and                          
              eigenfunctions) of elastic waves in basins of arbitrary shape.                 
              With a judicious choice of approximations, this calculation could              
              be readily available to a wide spectrum of users whereas current               
              calculations require extensive codes and large computers for even              
              simple basin structures.  Applications are to site specific                    
              engineering and earthquake hazard estimations.  This research is               
              a component of the National Earthquake Hazard Reduction Program.
