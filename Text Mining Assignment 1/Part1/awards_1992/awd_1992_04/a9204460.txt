Abstract    :
                   The purpose of this project is to continue work on slow                   
              hydromagnetic waves in rotating geometries using multiple scale                
              asymptotic techniques, in particular, to extend this work to a                 
              parameter regime in which the primary force balance is                         
              magnetostrophic rather than geostrophic as previously assumed.                 
              These waves will also be studied for stability while incorporating             
              the effects of ohmic and viscous diffusion, buoyancy and                       
              differential rotation.
