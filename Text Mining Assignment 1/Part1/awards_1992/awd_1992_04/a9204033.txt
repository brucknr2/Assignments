Abstract    :
              In this Small Grant for Exploratory Research, we                               
              propose to develop an all solid-state laser system                             
              capable of generating light pulses of unprecedented                            
              short duration.  The technique of non-linear mode-                             
              locking can be used to generate femtosecond-duration                           
              pulses from a titanium-doped sapphire laser.  The                              
              major limitation on the minimum pulse width                                    
              obtainable from this laser is optical dispersion inside                        
              the laser cavity; i.e. different wavelengths of light take                     
              a varying time to complete a round-trip through the                            
              cavity of the laser.  Since an ultrashort laser pulse                          
              must have a wide spectral width, a short pulse will                            
              not stay short if there is substantial dispersion in the                       
              laser cavity.  By doing detailed calculations of                               
              dispersion, we have discovered a number of methods                             
              for minimizing it in this laser.  We have already                              
              produced pulses of 25 femtoseconds duration-- a                                
              record for ultrafast lasers.  We plan to expand upon                           
              this work to further advance the state-of-the-art in                           
              ultrafast laser technology.  By designing a new laser,                         
              we expect to be able to demonstrate a simple and                               
              reliable source of 15-20 fs pulses.  Our work promises                         
              to expand the utility of lasers for studying ultrafast                         
              processes in electronic materials and in chemical                              
              reactions.
