Abstract    :
              9204040  Richman  In this project, four principal investigators with support
              from  five separate institutions will study energy, momentum, and  vorticity
              budgets, and zonal volume and heat transport variability  in the Antarctic
              Circumpolar Current (ACC) south of Tasmania,  Australia.  A mix of moored
              current meters seafloor electric field  recorders, and inverted echo sounders
              will be used in collaboration  with similar resources from scientists in
              Hobart, Tasmania.  In  this component, the PI will oversee the preparation and
              deployment  of an array of conventional current meters for direct velocity and 
              temperature measurement.
