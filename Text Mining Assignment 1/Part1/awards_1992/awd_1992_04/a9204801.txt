Abstract    :
                   The Department of Mathematics at the University of Toledo                 
              will purchase graphics computer workstation equipment which will               
              be dedicated to the support of research in the mathematical                    
              sciences.  The equipment will be used for several research                     
              projects.  i) Differential geometry and soliton theory: liquid                 
              bridges; moduli spaces of integrable surfaces (such as minimal                 
              surfaces, Willmore surfaces), magnetic monopoles, and instantons;              
              spectral curves and their Jacobians; Kac-Moody algebras and the                
              Yang-Baxter equations.  ii) Mathematical Physics: quantization                 
              methods; domain characterization; quasicrystals with defects;                  
              nonlinear control problems; eigenvalue problems.  iii) Dynamical               
              systems: chaotic layers in perturbed systems; the three-body                   
              problem with collisions; integrability of two-dimensional                      
              connections.
