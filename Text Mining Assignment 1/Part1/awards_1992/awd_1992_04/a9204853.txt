Abstract    :
                   The Networked Resource Discovery Project of Colorado has                  
              investigated a number of issues concerned with allowing users of               
              the Internet to discover resources of interest in large                        
              administratively decentralized environments, including resources               
              such as documents, network services, and people.  Implicit in these            
              projects is the assumption that the Internet will continue to grow             
              and evolve as a medium for supporting wide area distributed                    
              applications.  In response to a number of well publicized problems             
              many sites have installed mechanisms to limit their exposure to                
              security intrusions.  While these measures are preferable to the               
              damage that could occur from security violations, taken to extremes            
              they could limit the capability of the Internet.  To understand the            
              evolution of this situation, the researchers propose to carry out              
              a longitudinal measurement study of changes in service-level                   
              reachability in the global TCP/IP Internet.  The data they gather              
              will uncover changes in how sites resolve the problem of supporting            
              open network usage while ensuring reasonable security.
