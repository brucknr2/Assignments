Abstract    :
              9204113  Luther  In this project, four principal investigators with support from
               five separate institutions will study energy, momentum, and  vorticity
              budgets, and zonal volume and heat transport variability  in the Antarctic
              Circumpolar Current (ACC) south of Tasmania,  Australia.  A mix of moored
              current meters seafloor electric field  recorders, and inverted echo sounders
              will be used in collaboration  with similar resources from scientists in
              Hobart, Tasmania.  In  this component, the PI will work with the University of
              Hawaii and  Scripps Institution of Oceanography to oversee the construction and
               deployment of the Bottom Pressure gauges and seafloor Horizontal  Electric
              Field (HEF) instruments for determining barotropic current  variability.
