Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This  project for instrument development will provide components               
              for a multichamber surface science system that will be attached to             
              an ultra-high vacuum high resolution electron microscope at                    
              Northwestern University for the fundamental study of material                  
              surfaces.  Unique studies of film growth, interactions of gases                
              with surfaces,  fundamental surface science, and buried interface              
              problems with a true marriage of traditional surface science and               
              high resolution electron microscopy will be capable with this                  
              instrument.  The basic idea is to change from a single, limited                
              transfer chamber to a set of interconnected chambers, each                     
              specializing in a different set of techniques.  The resulting                  
              system will consist of four chambers with a small airlock specimen             
              entry system and a central transfer vessel.  This project has                  
              several goals:  to store samples under UHV,  to have separate                  
              chambers where deposition or gas treatments can be performed, to               
              have small probe imaging equipment available, to have good chemical            
              analysis.   The project combines electron microscopy with surface              
              science and thin films technology.   Research projects will focus              
              on fundamental thin film research, surfaces and catalysis, and                 
              grain boundary studies, involving several groups at Northwestern,              
              collaborations with National Laboratories, and industry. //
