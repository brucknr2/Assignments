Abstract    :
              One of the classic model compounds for membrane ion channel                    
              permeation is Amphotericin B, although the structure of the channel            
              is still unknown.  This polyene macrolide is thought to form ion               
              permeable pores in lipid membranes by organizing into a barrel                 
              stave like arrangement of molecules with the polar polyol region in            
              the middle.  However, the size and nature of the channels seem to              
              vary depending upon which sterol, ergosterol or cholesterol, is                
              present in the phospholipid membrane.  The supramolecular structure            
              of such channels may be revealed by studying its ion permeation                
              properties, especially the selectivity sequence of related ions                
              (e.g. the alkali metal series).  The three basic goals for this                
              research are: 1)Obtain complete Group IA and IIA metal cation and              
              halide selectivity sequences for Amphotericin channels in different            
              phospholipid and sterol membrane environments, 2) Determine the                
              temperature dependence, aggregation state and molecularity of                  
              channel formation in these environments, 3) Using these data in                
              conjunction with electrostatic molecular modeling software, design             
              consistent models for Amphotericin channel structures.                         
              %%%                                                                            
              Biological membrane ion channels play a central role in many                   
              processes from neurotransmission to cystic fibrosis.  This research            
              should advance on knowledge of Amphotericin channels and ion                   
              channels in general.
