Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Electronic and magnetic correlations modulated by disorder provide             
              the basis for a wide variety of collective effects.  The proposed              
              research will probe the relative contributions and interplay of                
              these effects by introducing symmetry-breaking fields such as                  
              uniaxial stress and magnetic field in the low-temperature limit.               
                                                                                             
              Using this technique for separating different effects, one hopes to            
              achieve a clearer understanding of the basic properties of metals              
              at low temperatures.
