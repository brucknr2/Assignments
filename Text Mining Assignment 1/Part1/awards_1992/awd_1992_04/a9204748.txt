Abstract    :
                This research is to use long-period surface waves recorded at the            
              TERRAscope (the very-broadband seismic network recently installed              
              in southern California by the California Institute of Technology)              
              to determine phase velocities in southern California.  A well                  
              established method will be applied to these modern high-quality                
              data.  The period range of the previous measurements was limited               
              to 27 seconds because of the limited quality of data.  The new data            
              set will extend the period range to 150 seconds.  The increased                
              period is critically important for exploring deep structures, that             
              is, to a depth of 200 km.  A better knowledge of these deep                    
              structures in the upper mantle will help understand the dynamics               
              that controls the seismic activity and tectonic deformation                    
              presently taking place in southern California.  This research is               
              a component of the National Earthquake Hazard Reduction Program.
