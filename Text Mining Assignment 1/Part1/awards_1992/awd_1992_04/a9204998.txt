Abstract    :
              9204998  Klemperer    This research will measure the seismic velocity structure
              of the  Aleutian Arc and the Bering Sea Shelf in order to provide  constraints
              on continental growth and composition.  It is widely  believed that two-thirds
              of the continental crust forming today  does so at magmatic arcs, but,
              paradoxically, recent geological and  petrological estimates of island arc
              composition suggest that arcs  are substantially more mafic than average
              continental crust is  believed to be.  The best test of the composition of
              in-situ crust  is its seismic velocity, but though many measurements of 
              continental velocity have been made worldwide, very few data exist  for island
              arcs because of the logistic difficulties of working in  these areas.  This
              project is coordinated with two other NSF-funded  projects to collect seismic
              reflection data via the R/V Ewing under  a University of Delaware and
              Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory grant  and an ocean-bottom seismometer
              deployment under a Woods-Hole  Oceanographic Institution grant.  ***
