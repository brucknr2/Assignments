Abstract    :
              The focus of the research is on the marine natural product                     
              chemistry of coral reefs.  One highlight of the research will                  
              be to understand the relationship between green algal hosts and                
              sacoglossan mollusks that leads to the production of cyclic                    
              depsipeptides. Another project will attempt to discover the                    
              biosynthetic pathways in a verongid sponge that leads to                       
              terpenes and cyano compounds.  Also, new compounds will be                     
              sought from tunicates and bryozoa that are abundant in Hawaiian                
              waters but have received little study.

              With this award, the Synthetic Organic Program is supporting                   
              the research of Dr. Paul J. Scheuer of the Department of                       
              Chemistry at the University of Hawaii, Manoa.  Professor                       
              Scheuer will focus his work on elucidating coral reef phenomena                
              at the molecular level by discovering new natural products from                
              organisms or groups of organisms which reside in Hawaiian                      
              waters.
