Abstract    :
              Aquatic larvae of the midge, Chironomus, produce silk-like fibers              
              which are composite polymers of secretory proteins synthesized by              
              the larval salivary glands.  How these proteins assemble into                  
              water-insoluble fibers as they exit the gland through the salivary             
              duct is not known.  The special lobe of Chironomus thummi salivary             
              glands consists of four cells which synthesize a unique secretory              
              protein, ssp160.  The proximity of the special lobe to the salivary            
              duct implies that ssp160 may somehow be involved in the assembly               
              and processing of secretory proteins into supramolecular fibers as             
              they exit the gland via the duct.  The objectives of this proposal             
              are to learn:  1) the primary structure of ssp160 by cloning and               
              sequencing its cDNA, 2) determine the level at which its cell-                 
              specific synthesis is regulated by measuring in vivo rates of                  
              transcription and steady-state levels of mRNA and protein, and 3)              
              begin to dissect its involvement in Chironomid secretory protein               
              disassembly and reassembly in vitro.

              This project will enhance our understanding of the composition,                
              assembly and processing of a unique biomaterial, Chironomid silk.              
              Furthermore, the information gained will be applicable to the                  
              design of novel peptide-based biomolecular materials.
