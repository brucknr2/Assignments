Abstract    :
                   Research will continue on parallel programs in stochastic                 
              geometry and stochastic Lyapunov stability theory.  In the former              
              direction research will involve the recurrence of isotropic                    
              transport processes and a project on eigenfunction expansions,                 
              both in the context of Riemannian manifolds.  The work on                      
              Lyapunov stability will investigate nonlinear oscillations and                 
              wave equations with boundary conditions.  Continued support is                 
              also being provided for the Midwest Probability Colloquium, which              
              now functions as a major annual event in the field of probability              
              theory.                                                                        
                   Mathematical research in probability theory is used as a                  
              tool for modeling in both the physical and social sciences.  This              
              award will continue the development of these tools.  In addition               
              it will provide support for a meeting which has been very                      
              successful in bringing together research workers from many                     
              specialty areas.
