Abstract    :
                   The island of Taiwan is undergoing active deformation and                 
              uplift as a result of subduction of the Philippine Sea plate under             
              the Eurasian plate, and provides a natural laboratory to study the             
              kinematics of collision.  This project will focus on the kinematic             
              history of the hinterland region of central Taiwan, taking                     
              advantage of the southward propagation of the arc-continent                    
              collision to proxy sequential development of deformation features.             
              A variety of strain and kinematic indicators will be studied and               
              the results will be applied to several major hypotheses of                     
              collision tectonics including whether the hinterland is shortening             
              with a consistent transport direction or involves two oppositely               
              verging transport directions and the relative importance of                    
              tectonic denudation and erosion during unroofing of the hinterland.
