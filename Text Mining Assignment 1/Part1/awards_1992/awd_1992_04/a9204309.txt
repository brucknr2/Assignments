Abstract    :
              The proposed research is concerned                                             
              with control design for systems                                                
              with uncertainties.  For parametric                                            
              uncertainties the investigation                                                
              will focus on both stability and                                               
              performance issues with the purpose                                            
              of reducing the computational

              investigation will include, the                                                
              problem of designing adaptive

              systems is not available, and the                                              
              performance requirements encounter                                             
              many parametric obstacles.
