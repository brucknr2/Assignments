Abstract    :
                   The principal investigator will study circle packings and                 
              quasiconformal mappings. One main problem to be studied is the                 
              Koeba uniformization conjecture which states that any domain in                
              the extended complex plane is conformally homeomorphic to a                    
              circle domain in the extended plane. The techniques to be used in              
              this study are closely related to the theory of quasiconformal                 
              maps.                                                                          
                   This award will support research in the general area of                   
              differential geometry and global analysis. Differential geometry               
              is the study of the relationship between the geometry of a space               
              and analytic concepts defined on the space. Global analysis is                 
              the study of the overall geometric and topological properties of               
              a space by piecing together local information. Applications of                 
              these areas of mathematics in other sciences include the                       
              structure of complicated molecules, liquid-gas boundaries, and                 
              the large scale structure of the universe.
