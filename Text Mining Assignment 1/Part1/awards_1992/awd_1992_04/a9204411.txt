Abstract    :
              This three-year award supports U.S.-Ireland cooperative research in            
              theoretical physics between Robert F. O'Connell of Louisiana State             
              University and J.T. Lewis of the Dublin Institute of Advanced                  
              Studies.  The investigators will study stochastic processes in                 
              quantum systems with special emphasis on systems in quantum                    
              optics and lasers, atomic and condensed matter physics which                   
              involve the presence of a heat bath as an integral element.  They              
              will address the spin-boson problem where a two-level system                   
              interacts with a radiation field, and problems on blackbody                    
              radiation heat-bath and dissipative quantum tunneling.  The                    
              investigators will apply their results and methodology to study the            
              effects of quantum dissipation in systems that exhibit the                     
              phenomenon of chaos.  The U.S. group are experts in the                        
              theoretical aspects of quantum stochastic processes.  The Irish                
              investigators bring complementary expertise in the theoretical and             
              experimental aspects of chaos in semiconductor lasers.                         
                                                                                             
              Research in quantum stochastic processes have wide implications                
              for a variety of systems in physics.  This research will advance our           
              understanding of quantum electrodynamics, condensed-matter                     
              physics, laser physics and atomic physics.
