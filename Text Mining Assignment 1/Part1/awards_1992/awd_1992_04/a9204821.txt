Abstract    :
              This award will support travel to the 12th International Conference on         
              Distributed Computing Systems to be held in Yokohama, Japan June 9-12,         
              1992.  Without this funding it is unlikely that there will be as               
              significant a US presence at the conference.  This funding will enable         
              12 young researchers in this field to attend the conference.  A                
              special subcommittee will decide who will be funded to attend the              
              conference.  Also since only partial funding is requested, the                 
              participants who are chosen will still have to provide substantial             
              funding of their own in order to attend the conference.
