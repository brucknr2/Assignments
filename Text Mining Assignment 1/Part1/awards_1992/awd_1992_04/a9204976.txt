Abstract    :
                   This award supports a feasibility study to test a new system              
              for the quantitative release of oxygen from the surfaces of thick              
              sections of silicate rocks or minerals by use of a pulsed excimer              
              laser emitting in the ultraviolet (193 nm). The system will be                 
              designed to release molecules from the surface by breaking bonds               
              without heating the sample significantly. The released molecules               
              then are reacted with fluorine gas to liberate oxygen which is fed             
              to a mass spectrometer in the form of CO2 gas. The system is                   
              expected to improve existing laser sources for stable isotope mass             
              spectrometry which use longer wave length lasers that melt the                 
              sample before releasing oxygen-containing molecules, thereby                   
              causing spurious isotope fractionation and a degradation of the                
              spatial resolution of the method.
