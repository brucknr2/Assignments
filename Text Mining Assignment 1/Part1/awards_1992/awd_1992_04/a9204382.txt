Abstract    :
                   The rational elliptic genus has been refined to an elliptic               
              genus with values in a ring of level-2 modular forms over the                  
              coefficient ring of real K-theory.  The refined genus retains at               
              least some of the properties of the rational genus (e.g.,                      
              modularity, integrality).  Other properties, such as rigidity,                 
              can be proven in special cases (e.g., for circle actions).  The                
              project suggests a systematic study of the refined genus, its                  
              connections with Lie group theory, Riemannian geometry, and index              
              theory on the free loop space.                                                 
                   The rational elliptic genus was introduced by the principal               
              investigator in connection with a physics inspired question of E.              
              Witten.  Both the rigidity and modularity have an interpretation               
              in Quantum Field Theory, which probably provides the best                      
              "explanation" for them.  There are indications that the torsion                
              invariants derived from the refined elliptic genus also have a                 
              physics interpretation.  The interplay between theoretical                     
              physics and topology is one of the main attractions of the                     
              subject.
