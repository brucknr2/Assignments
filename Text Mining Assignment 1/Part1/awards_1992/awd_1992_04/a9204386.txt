Abstract    :
                This research is to utilize a theoretical method developed by                
              the Principal Investigator, the partitioned waveform method, to                
              digital and analog seismograms to investigate the S velocity in                
              the upper mantle of the North American plate, with special                     
              emphasis on the lithosphere/asthenosphere structure beneath the                
              continent.  The major goal of this study will be to provide a                  
              structural interpretation of the upper mantle beneath the                      
              continents with a resolution of a few hundred km or better that                
              is sufficiently well balanced geographically and that extends                  
              deep enough to serve as a framework for the interpretation of                  
              gravity anomalies, heat flow and stress patterns, and to study                 
              the evolution of the continent.
