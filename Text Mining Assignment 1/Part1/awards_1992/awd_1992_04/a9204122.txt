Abstract    :
              This is a one year cooperative research project proposed by Dr.                
              Albert Tung, San Jose State University and Professor Weiling                   
              Chiang, National Central University, supported by the AIT (U.S.)               
              - CCNAA (Taiwan) Cooperative Science Program.  This project plans              
              to develop a non-parametric earthquake intensity forecast model                
              for prediction of spatial distribution of seismic intensity.                   
              This model can be used for seismic risk and damage assessment and              
              represents an improvement over currently used risk/damage                      
              assessment procedures.  Taiwan is one of the major earthquake                  
              areas.  The additional data from Taiwan will provide information               
              on seismic conditions not available in the U.S.  The result is an              
              improvement in scope and accuracy of the earthquake intensity                  
              forecast.
