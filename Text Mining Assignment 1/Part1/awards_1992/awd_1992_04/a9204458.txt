Abstract    :
              This project is for the continuation and extension of research on              
              the structure and dynamics of disordering in silicate liquids,                 
              glasses, and crystals, using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)                  
              spectroscopy.  The major objective of this work is to better                   
              understand the fundamentals of the thermodynamic and transport                 
              properties of disordered materials, particularly configurational               
              entropy, density, viscosity, and diffusivity, in order to more                 
              accurately extrapolate to conditions of pressure, temperature, and             
              time found in nature.  NMR will be used to study the local and                 
              intermediate range structure around geochemically significant                  
              cations, and the anion O, in liquids at high temperature and in                
              their glassy equivalents.  Particular attention will be paid to                
              the effects of temperature and pressure on coordination numbers of             
              Si, Al, and O.  Continue studies of crystalline solids will be used            
              to help calibrate and understand observations in glasses and                   
              liquids.
