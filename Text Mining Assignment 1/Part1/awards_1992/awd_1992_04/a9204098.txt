Abstract    :
                   This project will explore the dynamics of a small neural                  
              network.  There are three major aspects to the project:                        
              1. modelling the neural network as a system of nonlinear                       
              differential equations with explicit representation of ion                     
              channels for each neuron within the network                                    
              2. experiments on the pyloric circuit of the stomatogastric                    
              ganglion of spiny lobsters that will be used to provide input                  
              data for parameter values of the models and to test                            
                 predictions of the models                                                   
              3. mathematical research to develop algorithms that will lead to               
               tools for the explicit computation of geometric features                      
              within the models                                                              
                   A mathematical software package called dstool, developed at               
              Cornell for the exploration of dynamical systems, will be used,                
              and will incorporate algorithmic advances into this environment.               
              The initial emphasis will be the pacemaker neuron within the                   
              circuit.  Guckenheimer will investigate how its response depends               
              upon multiparameter variations of its environment that come from               
              application of channel blockers and neuromodulators and from                   
              changes in extracellular ionic concentrations.  Data from                      
              previous studies of synaptic efficacy and their dependencies upon              
              amines will be used in modelling the interactions of neurons                   
              within the network.
