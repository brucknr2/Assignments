Abstract    :
              The research focuses on obtaining a better understanding of the                
              behavior of waste remediation systems that may be difficult to                 
              visualize using traditional deterministic method. Concepts such                
              as redundancy, weakest link, robustness and complexity of the                  
              system are explicitly addressed. The objective is to improve the               
              design of those systems coast-effectively to achieve a desired                 
              level of the system performance. The approach requires the                     
              formulation of a reliability model relating the waste remediation              
              system performance and the system parameters.
