Abstract    :
                   The principal investigator will study geometric rigidity and              
              related problems from harmonic maps. The Kodaira-Bochner formulae              
              on submanifolds will be related to the formulae on the ambient                 
              manifold. In addition the principal investigator will continue                 
              his work on compactification of Kahler manifolds that satisfy                  
              certain curvature conditions.                                                  
                   This award will support research in the general area of                   
              differential geometry and global analysis. Differential geometry               
              is the study of the relationship between the geometry of a space               
              and analytic concepts defined on the space. Global analysis is                 
              the study of the overall geometric and topological properties of               
              a space by piecing together local information. Applications of                 
              these areas of mathematics in other sciences include the                       
              structure of complicated molecules, liquid-gas boundaries, and                 
              the large scale structure of the universe.
