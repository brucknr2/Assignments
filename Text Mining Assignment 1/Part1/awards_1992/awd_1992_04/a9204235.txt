Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  This project will bring together an interdisciplinary team in             
              theoretical hydrology to address the problem of defining rigorously            
              the relation between macroscopic, catchment-scale parameters                   
              describing runoff generation, net recharge, or groundwater flow                
              through scaling procedures applied to the non-linear mathematical              
              description of the underlying, local-scale physics.  The project               
              objectives are:  (1) To drive, using rigorous methods in the                   
              analysis of spatial data, a catchment-scale, process-based model               
              of streamflow generation in systems that are highly variable at the            
              local scale.  (2) To develop improved methods of conditioning                  
              stochastic models of catchment-scale spatial variability.  (3) To              
              investigate the general consequences of scale-invariance in the                
              local-scale velocity field for predictive models of subsurface                 
              water flows in heterogenous media.                                             
                   The results obtained will contribute to understanding the                 
              scale dependence and scale invariance of fundamental hydrologic                
              processes as they are resolved from the field plot experiment to               
              the regional or drainage-basin response.//
