Abstract    :
              The objective of the Graduate Engineering Education (GEE) Workshop             
              at Georgia Tech is to evaluate the GEE program in terms of program             
              content, management, and overall success in achieving the program's            
              goals.  In addition the workshop will provide recommendations for              
              improving the participation of women, minorities, and persons with             
              disabilities in doctoral programs.  Representatives of the 24                  
              participating universities and students will be invited.
