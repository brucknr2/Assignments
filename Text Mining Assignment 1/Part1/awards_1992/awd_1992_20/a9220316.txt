Abstract    :
              This grant provides partial support for long-duration balloon (LDB)            
              balloon flights and analysis of passive cosmic ray composition                 
              measurements.  The experiment will be done by a collaboration known            
              as JACEE (Japanese American Cosmic-ray Emulsion-chamber Experiment)            
              which includes nearly 35 senior scientists at 11 institutions from             
              the U.S., Japan and Poland.                                                    
                                                                                             
              The experimental aims are to measure the cosmic ray energy spectrum            
              and composition at ultra high energies (approaching 1015 eV) and               
              also to study nuclear interactions at these energies, beyond the               
              capabilities of any accelerator.  No other known technique can make            
              similar measurements.  It is the expectation of the JACEE group to             
              make 20 such LDB flights over the next 10 years.                               
                                                                                             
              This project is jointly supported by NSF, NASA and sister agencies             
              in Japan and Poland.
