Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This U.S.-Poland Research project between Drs. Wojbor A.                       
              Woyczynski and Robert Simha of the Center of Stochastic and                    
              Chaotic Processes in Science & Technology and the Departments of

              Western Reserve, and Professors Alexsander E. Weron, K. Weron,                 
              and A. Janicki of the H. Steinhaus Center for Stochastic

              is on "Stochastic Models of Relaxation Phenomena in Polymers and               
              Dielectrics."  The researchers will pursue four lines of                       
              research: (1) Probabilistic methods in the statistical mechanics               
              of systems occurring in surface chemistry; (2) Random graph and                
              statistical mechanical models of polymerization; (3) Foundational              
              problems related to the theory of stochastic integration; and (4)              
              Roughness of surfaces (a topic which keeps cropping up in a huge               
              variety of scientific problems from surface chemistry and the                  
              theory of liquid crystals, to analysis of oceanic flows over                   
              bottoms with rough topography).                                                
                                                                                             
              This project in mathematics and statistics fulfills the program                
              objective of advancing scientific knowledge by enabling leading                
              experts in Poland and the United States to combine complementary               
              talents and pool resources in areas of strong mutual interest and              
              competence.
