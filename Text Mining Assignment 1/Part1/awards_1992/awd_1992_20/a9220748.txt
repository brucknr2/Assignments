Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Many insects, including butterflies, use evasive flight as a means             
              of avoiding potential predators like birds and spiders. Many                   
              aspects of wing size and shape, body size and shape, and flight                
              behavior are correlated with successful predator avoidance, but it             
              is not clear what specific aspects of size and shape actually                  
              determine evasive flight ability and escape from predation. IN the             
              proposed research, we shall experimentally manipulate wing size and            
              body mass in Western White butterflies to test two competing                   
              hypotheses about the morphological determinants of predator-                   
              evasion: wing-loading (the ratio of body mass to wing area) and                
              flight muscle ratio (the ratio of flight muscle mass to total body             
              mass). By doing these manipulations in both the lab and the field,             
              we shall determine how wing-loading and flight muscle ratio affect             
              flight performance, predation rates, and survival and reproduction.
