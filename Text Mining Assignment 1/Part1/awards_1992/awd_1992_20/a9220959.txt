Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The primary objective of this US-Czech Joint Fund                              
              research project between Dr. Jan Pilar, the                                    
              Institute of Macromolecular Chemistry, Czech                                   
              Academy of Science and Dr. Shulamith Schlick,                                  
              University of Detroit, is to gain a better                                     
              understanding of segmental dynamics and phase                                  
              structure of polymers and their complexes in                                   
              dilute solutions and solid polymer blends by                                   
              means of Spin Label Electron Spin Resonance (ESR)                              
              and Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC).  The                              
              information on dynamics will be obtained by                                    
              analyzing line shapes of ESR spectra of spin                                   
              labels and/or spin probes incorporated in the                                  
              polymer systems; the phase structure will be                                   
              characterized by both ESR and DSC data.  An ESR                                
              imaging system will be used to gain a spatial                                  
              resolution of ESR data.                                                        
                                                                                             
              This research in materials research fulfills the                               
              program objective of advancing scientific                                      
              knowledge by enabling leading experts in the U.S.                              
              and Czech Republic to combine complementary                                    
              talents and pool research resources in areas of                                
              strong mutual interest and competence.  Funds for                              
              the project are awarded through the US-Czech                                   
              Joint Fund, Prague, in accordance with                                         
              established guidelines.
