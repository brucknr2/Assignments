Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This award provides travel support for Dr. Carol Bender of                     
              Oklahoma State University to conduct collaborative research                    
              with Dr. Robin Mitchell at the Mt. Albert Research Center in                   
              New Zealand on coronatine synthesis in P. syringae.  The                       
              phytotoxin coronatine is an important virulence factor in several              
              diseases caused by Pseudomonas syringae. The proposed work                     
              focuses on coupling activity, a step which catalyzes amide bond                
              formation between the nonphytotoxic precursors coronafacic and                 
              coronamic acid, resulting in the synthesis of coronatine. The                  
              research will produce a structural characterization of the                     
              coupling activity,    will attempt to identify the coupling                    
              promoter, and will identify factors which regulate the activity.               
              The investigators plan to study the kinetics and the specificity               
              of the coupling activity using a cell-free assay and C14-labeled               
              precursors to obtain information on coronatine biosynthesis.                   
                                                                                             
              This research is closely related to the objectives of                          
              Dr. Bender's NSF award 89-02561 on the genetics of coronatine                  
              synthesis in P. syringae. This award combines the expertise                    
              of the two investigators in molecular genetics and organic                     
              chemistry and provides Dr. Bender exposure to the radiotracer                  
              work in Dr. Mitchell's laboratory.
