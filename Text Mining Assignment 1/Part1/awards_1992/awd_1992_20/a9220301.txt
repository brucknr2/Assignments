Abstract    :
                   This is a "Tie" project between the University of Iowa and the            
              University of California at Berkeley.  The Berkeley I/UCRC for                 
              Sensors and Actuators is fabricating micromechanical devices for               
              precision instrument applications with structural nonlinear                    
              behavior.  To support analysis of micromechanical instruments, it              
              is important to develop a numerically efficient structure dynamic              
              response simulation capability that accounts for geometric                     
              nonlinearity.  The I/UCRC for Simulation Center for Mechanical                 
              System at the University of Iowa has established very strong                   
              research base in simulation software for dynamics of mechanical                
              systems.                                                                       
                   This project meets the requirements of NSF I/UCRC Program                 
              "Tie" project award.  The Program Director recommends the                      
              University of Iowa be awarded $50,000 for a two year "Tie" project
