Abstract    :
                   Dr. James and his colleagues will undertake a comprehensive               
              experimental investigation of the electron impact excitation of                
              the Lyman and Balmer series of atomic hydrogen.  Excitation of                 
              atomic hydrogen by electron impact remains the key testing ground              
              for the development of fundamental theories electron-particle                  
              interactions and these experiments will confront theory with                   
              direct measurements.
