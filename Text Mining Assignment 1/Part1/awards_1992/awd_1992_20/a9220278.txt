Abstract    :
              In this project in the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program                 
              of the Chemistry Division, James Kinsey of Rice University will                
              develop new picosecond laser techniques for studying reaction                  
              dynamics of excited electronic states.  Particular attention                   
              will be paid to the Raman excitation profile, which arises from                
              the small fraction of excited molecules which emit photons at                  
              some point during their decomposition.  Theoretical analyses of                
              these profiles provides a unique source of information about                   
              the earliest stages of photodecomposition.                                     
              %%%                                                                            
              Photochemical decompositions are among the most fundamental and                
              important of chemical processes.  For example, a detailed                      
              elucidation of how sunlight leads to ozone decomposition is                    
              essential if we hope to alter the environmental consequences of                
              ozone layer depletion.  The early stages of such photochemical                 
              reactions are very hard to study in the laboratory since they                  
              are over in less time than light takes to travel 0.001 inches.                 
              Prof. Kinsey's studies of photochemical decomposition of ozone                 
              and other molecules will provide powerful new tools for gaining                
              insight into reactions on this ultrafast timescale.
