Abstract    :
                   Burning of fossil fuel, deforestation, and other activities               
              of modern civilization are increasing the level of carbon dioxide              
              (CO2) in the air.  Unfortunately, CO2 is one of the gases that may             
              cause global warming in the future.  Additionally, CO2 affects how             
              plants grow, and how groups of plants interact in ecosystems.                  
              Therefore, it is important for scientists to understand the factors            
              that influence the production and movement of CO2 in the earth and             
              atmosphere.  This knowledge will help people and their governments             
              prevent undesirable environmental changes.                                     
                   Some of the CO2 in the air comes from the soil.  Plant roots              
              and soil microorganisms produce CO2 gas during an important                    
              biological process called "soil respiration".  The CO2 gas then                
              percolates up out of the soil into the atmosphere.  Scientists in              
              Kansas will use special instruments to measure soil respiration                
              from a tallgrass prairie.  Big tent-like chambers are used to                  
              fumigate the air above the prairie with CO2 in order to                        
              artificially create a high CO2 environment.  By measuring soil                 
              respiration inside the CO2 tents, the scientists will be able to               
              predict if more or less CO2 will come form the soil in the future.             
              This information will also help other scientists who are studying              
              global warming and other environmental problems.
