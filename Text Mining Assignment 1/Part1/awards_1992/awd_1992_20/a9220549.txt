Abstract    :
              Pomeranz         This research is on finding procedures to derive compact or 
              small test sets that cover a comprehensive set of modeled faults,  required to
              achieve high reliability of manufactured VLSI chips.   A fault model that
              allows uniform representation of various fault  models is being explored as the
              basis for generating small, yet  comprehensive test sets.  A set of tools to
              deal with different  aspects of testing quality for combinational and fully
              scanned  sequential circuits is being built.  These are:  1.     generation of
              small test sets for a comprehensive set of  faults, including efficient
              treatment of path delay faults;  2.     design for testability to allow faults
              undetectable in the  original to be detected in a modified circuit; and  3.    
              built in test pattern generation based on the test sets  produced when stored
              pattern tests cannot be used.
