Abstract    :
              An autoclave (sterilizer) will be used for a wide range of                     
              biological studies, from plant tissue culture to the in vitro                  
              culture of mammalian cells.  All of the research is to be                      
              conducted in the Carver Research Foundation Laboratory building                
              by a team of fourteen researchers from several areas of the                    
              Tuskegee University campus.  The single autoclave that served the              
              researchers in the CRFL was 25 years old and had been repaired                 
              numerous times; it finally became inoperable.  There is a small                
              autoclave nest door in a science building, but it was too small                
              for some projects, its major use was for classes, and it was                   
              often non-functioning.  Therefore, a new autoclave was                         
              desperately needed to carry out research efficiently in CRFL.
