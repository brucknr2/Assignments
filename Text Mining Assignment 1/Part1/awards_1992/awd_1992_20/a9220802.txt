Abstract    :
              9220802  Campbell    This three-year award supports U.S.-France cooperative
              research  between Stephen L. Campbell of North Carolina State University  and
              Francois Deleecque of INRIA (French National Institute for  Research in
              Computer Science and Applied Mathematics),  Rocquencourt, France.  Ramine
              Nikoukhah, Jean Pierre Quadrat,  also from INRIA Rocquencourt, will participate
              in the project.   The objective of their research is to develop optimal control
               algorithms for constrained mechanical systems, numerical methods  and
              solutions for differential equations, and a computer  environment employing
              symbolic, graphic and numerical software.    Differential-algebraic equations
              (DAEs), which the investigators  will utilize in their research, are found to
              be extremely useful  for expressing and modeling optimal control of mechnical
              systems.   DAEs have advantages over ordinary differential equations in that 
              one can easily vary design parameters in an implicit model, a  particular
              system structure can be better exploited, and less  mathematical expertise is
              required on the part of the designer.   The proposed research in numerical
              solution of DAEs is important  for work in singular systems, which appear, for
              example, in  circuits and power systems.  Research results may include new and 
              more efficient algorithms and design procedures that are  applicable to a wide
              variety of engineering systems.  The project  takes advantage of the
              complementary background of the U.S. and  French investigators in many
              different areas, including control  and mechanics, numerical solutions of DAES,
              and computer  software.  ***
