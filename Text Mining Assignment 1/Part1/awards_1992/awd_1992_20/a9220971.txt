Abstract    :
              This award is the starter grant increment of Dr. Ellman's                      
              Postdoctoral Fellowship in Chemistry. The work will develop                    
              methods of combinatorial synthesis of organic compounds which                  
              may have physiological activity. The approach of combinatorial                 
              sythesis is important because it can lead to very many more                    
              compounds than the current "one at a time" methods. This                       
              becomes particularly useful when systematically related                        
              derivatives are desired. The work to be done will lead to                      
              benzodiazepines from the acylation or alkylation of amino                      
              benzophenones in microtiter plates. Methods will be developed                  
              to produce libraries of more complex products.                                 
              %%%                                                                            
              Currently, synthetic methods are limited by the fact that they                 
              produce one compound at a time. This work will lead to the                     
              simultaneous production of many related compounds. Development                 
              of the methods to be studied can lead to much more efficient                   
              and less expensive approaches to important drugs for human                     
              diseases.
