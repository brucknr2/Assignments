Abstract    :
                   This award covers experimental Elementary Particle                        
              Physics Research by a group at the University of Washington in                 
              collaboration with other NSF and DOE supported scientists.                     
              The group will continue studying pi and K-meson production and                 
              decay and Mu-meson scattering at Fermilab.  They also will                     
              study the properties of proton-proton collisions at the                        
              highest attainable energies at the Superconducting Super                       
              Collider.
