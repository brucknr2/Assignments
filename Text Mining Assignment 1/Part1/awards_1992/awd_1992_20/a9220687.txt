Abstract    :
              A Workshop on new developments and techniques in polarized gas                 
              targets and polarized electron and ion sources will be held.                   
              Such devices are central to new thrusts in nuclear and elementary              
              particle physics, worldwide.  This workshop is part of a long                  
              series of meetings held roughly every 3-4 years, has been                      
              sanctioned by IUPAP and will have strong international                         
              participation.
