Abstract    :
              The most important group of organisms able to control potential                
              insect pest populations are parasitic wasps that parasitize the                
              eggs, larvae, or pupae of their host.  These parasitic wasps are               
              the mainstay of classical biological control which has enormous                
              potential to impact agriculture and reduce the use of pesticides               
              worldwide.  Parasitic wasps have a vast array of life histories and            
              a unique ability to control the sex ratio of their progeny.  Sex               
              ratio biasing has a critical impact on the demography of wasp                  
              populations and their ability to compare with other wasp species               
              and regulate host populations.  This study involves developing a               
              model of a parasitic wasp Diadegma insulare on diamondback moth                
              which is a pest in cruciferous crops (cabbage, cauliflower,etc.)               
              world wide. The study focuses on the influence of the quality of               
              plants on the quality of diamondback moth larvae and how the                   
              quality of these larvae influences the demography of Diadegma,                 
              especially in terms of sex ratio biasing.  The challenge of the                
              study is to obtain a realistic model that integrates genetic and               
              environmental components associated with sex ratio biasing in a 3-             
              trophic level ecological interaction, and to use the model to help             
              interpret data obtained from field and laboratory experiments.  The            
              knowledge gained could help in promoting biological control of                 
              diamondback moth.//
