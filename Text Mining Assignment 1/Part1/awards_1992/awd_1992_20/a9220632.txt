Abstract    :
              9220632  Basar  This proposal describes a two-year research collaboration
              between  the Coordinated Science Laboratory of the University of Illinois at 
              Urbana-Champaign (UIUC) and the Sophia-Antipolis Center of INRIA  (FRANCE),
              within the scope of an already existing initiative  between NSF and INRIA.  The
              principal investigator who is a  Professor of Electrical and Computer
              Engineering, and at INRIA his  counterpart will be the Director of the
              Sophia-Antipolis Center.   Two research teams (comprised of Ph.D. students and
              post-doctoral  fellows) led by these two investigators in the two countries
              will  collaborate on research projects with the common theme of dynamic  game
              theory, with applications in robust controller designs.  ***
