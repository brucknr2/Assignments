Abstract    :
              This is a unit of DOE/NSF/USDA Collaborative Research in Plant                 
              Biology Program.                                                               
                                                                                             
              The theme of this research training group is plant-insect                      
              interaction.  Insects play important roles, both beneficial and                
              detrimental, in plant growth and development.  One of major                    
              challenges of biotechnology research has been how to minimize                  
              detrimental effects of insects on plants.  Efforts to date suggest             
              that creative interfacing within and between many disciplines is               
              needed in order to meet the challenge.  The aim of this research               
              group is to build these interfaces.  The members plan to develop a             
              center of excellence in the genetic engineering of plants, guided              
              by a combination of research skills including expertise in insect              
              ethology, physiology and ecology.  The research training group                 
              award will provide opportunities for interdisciplinary research to             
              17 faculty members, and support postdoctoral and graduate students,            
              as well as selected undergraduate students who will be exposed to              
              a broad range of scientific research as related to plant-insect                
              interaction.
