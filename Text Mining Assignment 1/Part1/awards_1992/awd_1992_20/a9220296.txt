Abstract    :
              This publication subsidy will partially offset the anticipated                 
              cost (and loss) of publishing the first taxonomic volume of the                
              Flora of the Venezuelan Guayana.  The Flora, planned to comprise               
              9 volumes, has 170 contributors, and treats 9300 species, of                   
              which more than half will be illustrated with line drawing.                    
              Research for the Flora was supported by two NSF research awards.               
              Missouri Botanical Garden, the PI institution, will provide 50                 
              copies to Latin American institutions that would otherwise not be              
              able to purchase the volume.  The Venezuelan government will                   
              50 copies to distribute to botanical institutions and government               
              agencies.  This 650 page volume is the beginning of a major flora              
              of Venezuela which will enhance our understanding of Latin                     
              American floral diversity and have a significant impact on                     
              research and education in Latin American botanical disciplines.
