Abstract    :
                   This award provides one-half the funds for the acquisition of             
              an X-ray fluorescence (XRF) spectrometer system to be installed and            
              operated in the Department of Geology at Syracuse University. The              
              University is committed to providing the remaining funds necessary             
              for this acquisition.                                                          
                   The XRF system will provide a capability for rapid and                    
              accurate chemical analysis of rocks and mineral samples required               
              for the research projects of the principal investigator, colleagues            
              and graduate students at Syracuse. The instrument will also serve              
              the teaching needs of the Department of Geology, as well as the                
              research and teaching needs of Chemistry, Chemical Engineering, and            
              Mechanical Engineering departments at Syracuse. The new XRF                    
              laboratory is to be made available also to other university and                
              college groups on a regional basis.
