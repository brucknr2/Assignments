Abstract    :
              The principal goals of this research are to investigate Re-                    
              Os systematics in the upper mantle and the nature of                           
              processes that produce Os isotopic variations in the mantle.                   
              To achieve these goals, the P.I.s will implement a two-phase                   
              research program.  First, they will expand the                                 
              characterization of Os isotope ratios in OIBs by analyzing                     
              selected basalts from Iceland, Hawaii, St. Helena and the                      
              Canary Islands.  Second, they will investigate the extent to                   
              which assimilation of altered crust may be important in                        
              determining the Os isotopic composition of OIBs by comparing                   
              Re-Os systematics in differentiated and undifferentiated                       
              basalts, and by direct characterization of altered submarine                   
              basalt sections.
