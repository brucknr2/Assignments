Abstract    :
              The proposed studies address the chemical mechanism of the                     
              excitatory serotonin type-3 receptor as expressed in NIE-115 cells.            
              Two rapid kinetic approaches will be employed: (1) a cell-flow                 
              method, and (2) laser-pulse photolysis of labile serotonin cage                
              species.  Transmembrane channel behavior will be investigated over             
              wide ranges of time and serotonin concentration.  The effects of               
              inhibitors will be explored.

              Neurotransmitter receptor-mediated reactions in specific cells of              
              the nervous system account for the initiation, regulation, and                 
              modulation of signal transmission.  These processes are all                    
              required for nervous system function.  The studies proposed are                
              aimed at developing a complete kinetic understanding of the                    
              interaction between a ligand (serotonin) and its receptor in                   
              selected cell membranes.  Depending on whether serotonin is bound              
              to the receptor and for how long, the receptor forms transient ion-            
              conducting transmembrane channels which provide the fundamental                
              signal transmission event.  Careful time-dependence studies are                
              required in order to develop useful models of signal transmission.             
              Development of such basic information is fundamental to progress in            
              understanding the nature of nervous system function and                        
              integration.
