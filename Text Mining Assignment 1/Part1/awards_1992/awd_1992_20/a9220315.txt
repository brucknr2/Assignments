Abstract    :
                   Several recent reports converge on the need for a National                
              Center for Ecological Synthesis and Analysis.  The PIs will run a              
              workshop, sponsored jointly by the Ecological Society of America               
              and the Association of Ecosystem Research Centers, to assess and               
              summarize the ideas of ecologists about such a center.  The                    
              workshop is designed to sample a broad spectrum of ecologists                  
              anddeliver a summary report to NSF in timely fashion.  Major                   
              goals are to (1) identify the kinds of questions that can only or              
              best be addressed by such a center, questions that are impossible              
              or very difficult to solve under extant mechanisms; and (2)                    
              identify and assess possible alternative administrative                        
              structures for such a center.
