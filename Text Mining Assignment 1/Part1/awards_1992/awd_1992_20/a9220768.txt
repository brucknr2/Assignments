Abstract    :
              This is the first year of a three year continuing award.  The                  
              research explores a theory of visual analysis of movement for use              
              in computer vision.  This theory deals with use of motion                      
              information for object recognition and addresses segmentation of               
              motion trajectories into groups of individual objects, such that               
              all trajectories in a given group are consistent with a single set             
              of 3D motion parameters; detection of cyclic motion and its use in             
              the trajectory matching;  study of relative motions for articulated            
              objects, and its use in modeling and detection of fundamental                  
              movements; discovery of the invariant relations between 2D and 3D              
              motion and their use in recognition; recognition of motion using               
              temporal and spatial information, including the matching of motion             
              trajectories of unequal length, using time warping.
