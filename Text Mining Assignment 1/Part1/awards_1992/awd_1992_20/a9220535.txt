Abstract    :
              The aim of the proposed studies is to identify amino acids involved            
              in base-specific contacts in the yeast DNA-binding protein RAP1.               
              The RAP1 protein is essential for viability in yeast and functions             
              in both regulation of transcription (as either a repressor or                  
              activator) and maintenance of telomere structure.  The DNA-binding             
              domain of RAP1 (A central 250 amino acid region) has no similarity             
              to known DNA binding motifs and thus may represent a novel class of            
              DNA binding proteins.                                                          
              The proposed research builds upon a genetic selection in yeast,                
              based on the ability of RAP1 to activate transcription, to isolate             
              mutant proteins with altered DNA binding specificity (ABS mutants).            
              Such mutants are identified as dominant suppressors that allow a               
              non-consensus (mutant) binding site to function as an activation               
              element.  Mutant proteins whose function is specific to changes in             
              only one position in the binding site will then be characterized               
              biochemically to determine precisely their sequence specificity of             
              binding.  Inferences from initial suppression studies will be                  
              extended by alanine substitution mutagenesis of small segments of              
              the DNA-binding domain (-10-15 amino acids) in a systematic search             
              for "missing contact" mutants.  Results from these experiments will            
              be used in saturation mutagenesis experiments designed to obtain               
              further quantitative information concerning specific amino acid-               
              base contacts.                                                                 
              %%%                                                                            
              Regulation of transcription in eukaryotics is of fundamental                   
              importance in both development and in an organism's response to its            
              environment.  This study relates to the role of sequence - specific            
              DNA binding regulating proteins in transcriptional regulation.
