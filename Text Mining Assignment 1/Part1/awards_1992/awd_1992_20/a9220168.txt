Abstract    :
              Accurate and efficient processing of primary transcription products            
              is absolutely required for normal gene expression in eukaryotic                
              cells.  Integration and coordination among the individual reactions            
              which constitute a functional RNA processing pathway are the                   
              subjects of this research.  Splicing and transport of tRNA                     
              transcripts in yeast and in Xenopus have been chosen as                        
              experimental models based on the availability of a large number of             
              tRNA genes for analysis detailed information regarding both tRNA               
              structure and mechanisms for tRNA processing, and the development              
              of a range of assay systems for measuring splicing and transport               
              reactions.  Quantitative microinjection of synthetic RNA substrates            
              into oocyte nuclei is used to measure both splicing and transport.             
              Experiments are proposed in two areas.  The first is a systematic              
              mutational analysis of tRNA gene mutations affecting IVS + and IVS-            
              tRNA transport.  The second is an analysis of the distinct  yeast-             
              like and vertebrate tRNA splicing pathways and their function in               
              oocytes.  Injection of splicing intermediates and coinjection of               
              yeast tRNA ligase will be used in this second experimental area.               
              Long term goals include analyses of potential regulation through               
              the use of alternate processing pathways and mechanisms for                    
              coupling of the splicing and transport steps.                                  
              %%%                                                                            
              Precursor transfer RNA molecules undergo shortening before they                
              become mature molecules that can function in ribosomal protein                 
              synthesis.  They must also be transported out of the nucleus of                
              eukaryotic cells.  These important steps in the gene expression of             
              functional tRNAs is the subject of this research.
