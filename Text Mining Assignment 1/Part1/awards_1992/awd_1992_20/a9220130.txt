Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The quantitative role of bacteriophages in the biogeochemical                  
              cycles of the marine environment is a most urgent question.  At                
              present, there is no direct method to measure phage production,                
              only indirect estimates of phage production based on measures of               
              phage decay rates by Norwegians scientists.  This project will                 
              develop urgently needed and innovative techniques for measuring                
              phage production in seawater.  Two radiotracer approaches will be              
              attempted to specifically measure DNA and RNA phage production.                
              The approach is risky because the strategy is to metabolically                 
              label bacteria and secondarily the phage DNA and RNA.  The methods             
              will be calibrated and field tested to assess whether or not phage             
              proliferation is an important process in marine ecosystems.
