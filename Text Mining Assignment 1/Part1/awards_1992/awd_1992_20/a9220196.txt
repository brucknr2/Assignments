Abstract    :
              CTS-9220196  University of Massachusetts  Ka M. Ng    ABSTRACT    Research in
              this project focuses on establishing basic steps for the separation of two- and
              three-solute mixtures by crystallization.  Tetrahedral phase diagrams for a
              three-solute system include 3 vertices for the pure solute compositions and a
              fourth for the solvent.  These diagrams can be used to design separations
              processes based on crystallization in which eutectic surfaces are crossed by
              solvent addition, removal, or stream combination.  Experimental work on model
              and industrially important systems is to confirm new separation schemes,
              determine optimum operating conditions, and establish guidelines for solvent
              selection.  Combination of extractive crystallization with other techniques
              will also be explored.    Half or more of the cost of producing pharmaceutical
              drugs and other important chemicals is often attributed to separation and
              purification.  New strategies for crystallization can improve product quality
              and lower cost for the consumer.  196  University of Massachusetts  Ka M. Ng
