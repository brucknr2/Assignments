Abstract    :
              Lev-Ari         This research aims to develop efficient model-based  techniques
              for non-stationary signal analysis and spectral  estimation, with a particular
              emphasis on Burg's maximum-entropy  approach and the order-recursive
              realization of linear  predictors.  The ultimate objectives are:  1.     to
              construct numerically-robust adaptive algorithms for  estimating the parameters
              of such models;  2.     to establish the statistical properties (e.g., rate of 
              convergence, tracking capability and steady-state error) of such  algorithms
              when applied to both persistent and transient non-  stationary signals; and  3.
                  to obtain simple procedures for recovering spectral  characterizations,
              such as the Wigner-Ville distribution or the  cyclic spectrum from the
              estimated model parameters.         Adaptive algorithms that efficiently
              estimate periodically-  varying model parameters associated with
              cyclostationary signals  have been constructed.   The ultimate goal is to
              extend these  results to a broader family of signals, including stationary, 
              cyclostationary, harmonizable, and asymptotically-mean-stationary  signals.  In
              particular,  multiresolution wavelet basis functions  are used to characterize
              the dynamics of time-varying model  parameters, leading to the construction of
              adaptive estimation  algorithms that are recursive in time, order and
              resolution.
