Abstract    :
                   Collision between India and Asia over the past 40 to 50                   
              million years has produced the Tibetan plateau, the largest                    
              and highest in the world.  To the north, the plateau ends at                   
              the southern rim of the Tarim Basin.  Across the Tarim Basin                   
              the Tian Shan mountain range also are due to the India-Asia                    
              collision, but how the stresses were transmitted across the                    
              basin are unclear.  This project involves structural,                          
              magnetostratigraphic, thermochronologic and sedimentological                   
              studies aimed at developing the evolutionary history of the                    
              southern Tian Shan and northern Tibetan Plateau.  Results                      
              will provide initial constraints on fault kinematics,                          
              cooling histories and magnitude and rate of shortening along                   
              the southern rim of the Tian Shan and the Plateau.
