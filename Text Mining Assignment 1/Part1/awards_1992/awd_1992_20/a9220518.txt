Abstract    :
                    Trichomycetes are commensalistic fungi that live obligately in           
              the guts of various insects, crustaceans, and millipedes.  The                 
              variety of host and habitats, the worldwide occurrence of all                  
              families, and the intercontinental distribution of some genera of              
              these fungi indicate that the relationship with arthropods is very             
              ancient.  Dr. Robert Lichtwardt of the University of Kansas seeks              
              to understand how and when trichomycetes evolved and became                    
              geographically distributed with their arthropod hosts.  Data from              
              Australia and New Zealand suggest that some fungal taxa may have               
              had common ancestors on Gondwana at least 70-80 million years ago.             
              Evidence to support the Gondwanan origin of austral trichomycetes              
              will be sought in southern South America.  Studies of other gut                
              fungi in marine, terrestrial, and freshwater arthropods may provide            
              evidence of how long certain species have been radiating with their            
              hosts, and the roles of dispersal and vicariance in allopatric                 
              distributions.  Phylogenetic analysis of trichomycete genera will              
              assist in understanding their evolution and biogeography, and                  
              isozyme phenotypes of cultured isolates from different geographical            
              regions of the world will provide some information on species                  
              variability.  Harpellales, whose species grow only in larval stages            
              of aquatic insects, will be studied to see whether or not their                
              propagules can disperse phoretically with adults.
