Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This project will provide support for shipboard scientific                     
              support equipment for the NSF.owned research vessels WECOMA,                   
              OCEANUS and ENDEAVOR which are dedicated to use in support of                  
              ocean science research.                                                        
                                                                                             
              The Shipboard Scientific Support Equipment Program provides funds              
              for ship equipment deemed essential to the proper and safe                     
              conduct of ocean science research. This Program provides support               
              for such items as deck equipment including winch systems for the               
              deployment and retrieval of scientific instruments, navigational               
              equipment such as radars, gyroscopes and earth satellite                       
              receivers to pin point the location of research sites,                         
              communication equipment including radio transceivers and                       
              satellite transceivers for voice and scientific data                           
              communications and other equipment such as motorized workboats                 
              for transporting scientists to and from data retrieval sites.                  
                                                                                             
              The Project Director, Kennard Palfrey is fully qualified to                    
              direct this project having had considerable experience in                      
              overseeing the acquisition and installation of shipboard                       
              equipment.                                                                     
                                                                                             
              The project will allow the institution to acquire a ship.set of                
              spare parts for the bow thruster on the WECOMA.  The spares will               
              be housed at the Oregon State University in preparation for use                
              as required for the WECOMA or its two sister ships, the OCEANUS                
              and ENDEAVOR.
