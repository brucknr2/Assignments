Abstract    :
              This proposal is for partial support of a conference entitled,                 
              "Solar System Plasma Physics:  Resolution of Processes in Space                
              and Time."  An equal amount of support is being requested from                 
              NASA.  The support is for organization and clerical expenses, on-              
              site logistical expenses, student travel grants and advertising                
              costs.  The purpose of the conference is to examine temporally                 
              and spatially varying phenomena within the solar-terrestrial                   
              environment and to discuss the current and future role of theory               
              and experiment in resolving their important aspects.
