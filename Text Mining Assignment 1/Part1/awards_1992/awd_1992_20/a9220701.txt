Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This grant examines the mechanism of stress corrosion cracking in              
              metal alloys.  The corrosion-assisted cleavage (CAC) model for                 
              transgranular stress corrosion cracking is tested for oriented                 
              single crystal copper-gold alloys.  Experiments involve monitoring             
              transient effects on load, extension, current, and acoustic                    
              emission during crack propagation.  Effects of dealloying are                  
              noted.  Film-forming systems, e.g. alpha brass and stainless steel,            
              are examined to determine the appropriate model for this behavior.             
              Intergranular stress corrosion is considered for oriented                      
              bicrystals of copper-gold alloys and alpha brass.

              This research explores stress corrosion cracking, an important                 
              failure problem in structural metal alloys.  Understanding the                 
              mechanism of fracture can lead to appropriate corrective measures.
