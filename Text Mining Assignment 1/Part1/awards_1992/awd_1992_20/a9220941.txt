Abstract    :
                   This interdisciplinary effort will examine geologic                       
              processes, such as hydrogeologic processes of coupled fracture                 
              growth and fluid flow, that are directly influenced by the                     
              spatial structure and evolution of rack fractures.  Modelling                  
              will incorporate physical models of fracture formation and                     
              stochastic process models.                                                     
                   This award supports the cross-disciplinary efforts and the                
              development of a research collaboration involving quantitative                 
              modelling in the geosciences.  In particular, the mathematician                
              statistician and the geoscientists will focus their attention on               
              developing a physically-based stochastic model for rock                        
              fractures.  This will meld probabilistic ideas with geologic                   
              understanding to address the phenomena of rock fractures and                   
              fluid flow through them.
