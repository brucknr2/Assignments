Abstract    :
              This award in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic                  
              Chemistry Program will provide partial travel support for eight                
              U.S. participants in an international workshop on                              
              polyoxometalates to be held in Germany in summer 1992.  The                    
              topic of the workshop is "Polyoxometalates: from Platonic                      
              Solids to Anti-Retroviral Activity."  The title recognizes that                
              applications of these materials have undergone recent, rapid                   
              growth and now include areas ranging from catalysis to                         
              medicinal.  An edited volume with a chapter from each of the                   
              twenty-four invited speakers will be produced.  Participants                   
              from nine countries are expected.  The U.S. organizer is Dr.                   
              Michael T. Pope of Georgetown University.
