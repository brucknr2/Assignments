Abstract    :
              The manner and rate of deformation of the Earth's major ice                    
              sheets depend on a complex interplay of their geographical and                 
              climatic setting, as well as their internal dynamics.  In the West             
              Antarctic Ice Sheet, it is known that rapidly moving ice streams               
              alternate with large areas of stagnant ice, and that the transition            
              between streaming and non-streaming flow can be be quite narrow.               
              In these lateral shear margins it is thought that the physical                 
              controls on ice stream dynamics must show significant differences.             
                                                                                             
              This study will examine the geophysical differences between an                 
              ice stream and a stagnant ridge along the Siple Coast in West                  
              Antarctica.  The ice will be probed with electromagnetic and                   
              seismic waves to infer the internal temperature and the crystalline            
              structure of the ice, as well as the proportion of old (Wisconsin              
              Ice Age) ice, since it is known that ice flow laws depend                      
              exponentially on temperature, that ice crystals are much less                  
              resistant to deformation in the plane of their hexagonal faces than            
              in other directions, and that old ice may deform much more readily             
              than ice of more recent geological age.  Measurement of radar                  
              diffraction patterns and the analysis of the records of micro-                 
              earthquakes can be used to show whether the base of the ice sheet              
              is frozen to the underlying bedrock.
