Abstract    :
              The focus of this research is the preparation and synthetic use                
              of allenylmetallic reagents of tin, boron, titanium and                        
              chromium.  Particular attention will center on SE' additions to                
              aldehydes as a route to enantioenriched propargylic and allenic                
              carbinols. Among the issues to be addressed include: the                       
              configurational and regiochemical stability of chiral allenyl                  
              and propargyl organometallics, the stereochemistry and                         
              regiochemistry of the SE' additions of these reagents, the                     
              effect of chiral ligands on the enantioselectivity of the SE'                  
              process, and possible applications of these reagents in natural                
              product synthesis.

              With this Renewal award, the Synthetic Organic Program is                      
              supporting the research of Dr. James A. Marshall of the                        
              Department of Chemistry at the University of South Carolina.                   
              Professor Marshall will focus his work on developing optically                 
              active organometallic reagents for possible use in the                         
              synthesis of a variety of natural products.
