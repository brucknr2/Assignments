Abstract    :
                   This award provides 70% of the funds required to purchase                 
              equipment for the upgrade of the experimental petrology and                    
              geochemistry laboratory in the Department of Earth and                         
              Environmental Sciences at the Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute. The            
              institution is committed to providing the remaining 30% of the                 
              funding required.                                                              
                   The equipment consists of high-pressure vessels, high-                    
              temperature furnaces and a cathodoluminescence microscope system.              
              The RPI laboratory is engaged in research projects investigating               
              the rates of geologic processes such as diffusion in minerals,                 
              melting and the transport of melts in the Earth's lower crust, all             
              of which require the equipment upgrade in this award.
