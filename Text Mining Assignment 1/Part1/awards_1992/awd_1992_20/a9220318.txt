Abstract    :
              This grant if for support of the operation of the University of                
              Rochester's Nuclear Structure Research Laboratory for the                      
              calendar years 1993-94.  The research exploits heavy-ion beams                 
              from the upgraded MP tandem Van de Graaff accelerator and a                    
              powerful arsenal of equipment such as the Recoil Mass                          
              Spectrometer, split-pole magnetic spectrometer, gamma-ray                      
              detector array and accelerator mass spectrometry system, for a                 
              broad program in nuclear science.  The investigations of nuclear               
              structure at high spin and isospin involve measurements of                     
              nuclear shapes, pairing correlations, spectroscopy of normal and               
              superdeformed states, and nuclear moments.  The nuclear reaction               
              programs involve studies of breakup, pre-equilibrium processes,                
              and transfer in heavy-ion reactions.  A study of electron-                     
              positron emission in heavy-ion collisions is another major thrust              
              of the program.  The accelerator mass spectrometry program                     
              encompasses a wide range of science with important applications                
              to environmental science.
