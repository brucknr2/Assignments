Abstract    :
              9220061  Parmentier         The studies will explore the physics of high
              Rayleigh number,  3D thermal convection in an infinite Prandtl number fluid
              based on  numerical experiments.  Numerical experiments completed thus far  for
              a volumetrically heated fluid cooled from above show that fluid  below the
              thermal boundary layer at the top boundary is  substantially non-adiabatic,
              contrary to the usual assumptions  about the structure of thermal convection at
              high Ra.  The  structure of the flow consists of nearly axisymmetric plumes
              that  are fed by the cold boundary layer.  Linear structures, that would 
              presumably represent subduction zones in the convecting mantle,  appear only
              infrequently.  The PI will carry out further numerical  experiments that
              include heating from below as well as volumetric   heating.  The principal
              innovation is a multigrid iterative solver  for buoyant viscous flow that is an
              order of magnitude or more  faster than the FFT methods that have frequently
              been used in 3D  convection problems.  The PI will extend development of
              multigrid  solvers to buoyant fiscous flow with variable viscosity.  This will 
              be carried out by solving equations formulated in primitive  variable
              (pressures and velocity components) rather than in vector  streamfunction and
              vorticity or some other potential function  formulation.  The first application
              of this new methodology will  be to understand how temperature and depth
              dependent viscosity  modify results of the constant viscosity, high Rayleigh
              number  numerical experiments.  ***
