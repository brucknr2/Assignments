Abstract    :
              In condensed matter systems there are a large number of degrees of             
              freedom which interact strongly with each other.  Many phemonena,              
              however, can be understood on the basis of a small number of                   
              degrees of freedom interacting on a single scale not significantly             
              larger than the atomic length scale.  A self-consistent one-                   
              particle theory can adequately describe these phenomena.  In                   
              contrast, there are many instances in which it is impossible to                
              guess the qualitative behavior of the system from a theory based on            
              a few degrees of freedom.  The aim of the present proposal is to               
              examine correlation effects in these strongly interacting systems.             
              In particular, theoretical research will be conducted on novel                 
              correlations in quantum antiferromagnets, on magnetic correlations             
              in high temperature cuprate superconductors, and on electronic                 
              correlation effects in newly discovered superconductors made by                
              doping fullerine molecular solids with alkali atoms.

              The theoretical research will focus on the physics of various                  
              materials which cannot be understood using conventional models and             
              techniques.  These materials include the copper-based high                     
              temperature superconductors, magnetic materials and the newly                  
              discovered superconducting materials based on the new form of                  
              carbon, Buckminsterfullerine.  New theoretical techniques will be              
              developed to understand these complex systems.
