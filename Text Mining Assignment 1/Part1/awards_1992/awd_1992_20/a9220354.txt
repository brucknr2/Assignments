Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The goal of this research is to gain an understanding of the                   
              social nature of Japanese quality control circles by examining                 
              the objectives, motivations, and attitudes of workers who                      
              participate in these circles.  Such circles group workers who are              
              responsible for the manufacture of a variety of items in a                     
              factory setting.  Their purpose is to provide management with                  
              suggestions to improve the quality and efficiency of production.               
              Previous studies have focused on how management organized such                 
              circles and the goals they established.  However, this study                   
              looks at such circles from the point of view of the workers and                
              therefore seeks to determine whether worker goal's are in                      
              conflict with management and how management and workers negotiate              
              mutually beneficial relationships in the pursuit of commons                    
              goals.                                                                         
                                                                                             
              The research will provide valuable training in developing                      
              ethnographic research skills in Japan.
