Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This three-year award supports ongoing U.S-France collaboration                
              in computer science between Jorge Nocedal of Northwestern                      
              University and Jean Charles Gilbert of INRIA (The French National              
              Institute for Research in Computer Science and Applied                         
              Mathematics).  The investigators worked previously on algorithms               
              for unconstrained optimization as applied to assimilation                      
              problems in meteorology.  They propose to extend their research                
              to solving large-scale constrained optimization problems                       
              involving a large number of variables.  The objective is to                    
              develop faster and more flexible algorithms and software than is               
              currently available.                                                           
                                                                                             
              The investigators selected an important nonlinear problem with an              
              arbitrarily large number of variables - the optimization of the                
              trajectory of a space shuttle as it re-enters the atmosphere.                  
              They will apply sequential quadratic programming methods to this               
              problem.  The proposal takes advantage of complementary                        
              expertise.  The U.S. investigator brings to this collaboration                 
              extensive experience in the development of software for large                  
              scale optimization.  This is complemented by the French                        
              investigator's expertise in solutions of optimal control problems              
              and recent studies of control of the space shuttle.  The project               
              may lead to practical applications, but will advance the use of                
              algorithms and software which may useful in engineering and                    
              scientific problems with large numbers of variables.
