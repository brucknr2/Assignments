Abstract    :
                   This award will support research aimed at improving the level             
              of accuracy attainable in the quantitative analysis of elements via            
              the electron microprobe. The electron microprobe is a very widely              
              used instrument capable of chemically analyzing for major, minor               
              and trace elements in solid samples with a spatial resolution of               
              one micrometer on polished sample surfaces. The analytical method              
              for determining the concentration of elements depends on the                   
              generation of characteristic X-radiation from atoms near the                   
              surface due to collisions with a finely focused beam of electrons.             
              The complicated interactions of electrons and photons that                     
              determine the intensity of the emerging X-radiation are the key to             
              correcting raw intensity data into accurate quantitative analyses.             
              The staff of the electron microprobe laboratory in the Department              
              of Geological and Planetary Sciences at Caltech, under the                     
              direction of the Principal Investigator, have extensive experience             
              the electron microprobe technique and its application to the                   
              quantitative analysis of geological samples. This project will                 
              produce improvements in the procedures for quantitative analysis               
              that will be disseminated throughout the interested scientific                 
              research
