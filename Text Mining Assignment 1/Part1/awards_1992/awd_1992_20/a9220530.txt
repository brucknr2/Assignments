Abstract    :
                   Resonant-mass detectors of gravitational radiation have                   
              been developed that are reliably operating at liquid helium                    
              temperature (4.2K) with sensitivities h ~ 6x10-19, where h is                  
              the dimensionless strain amplitude of the waves.  At this                      
              sensitivity level we do not expect to detect gravitational                     
              wave signals from anything but the rarest astrophysical                        
              events.  For the past several years the Stanford group has                     
              been designing and constructing an ultralow temperature (50mK)                 
              detector.  It is expected to have an initial sensitivity of at                 
              least h=10-19 and eventually less than 10-20, sufficient to                    
              detect gravitational radiation from plausible but rare                         
              astrophysical events that could occur in our galaxy or its                     
              immediate vicinity.                                                            
                   Success in this endeavour could bring direct confirmation                 
              of an important prediction of Einstein's General Theory of                     
              Relativity and also open an entirely new window on our                         
              universe that will yield information not available from                        
              optical, radio, infrared, x-ray, or gamma-ray astronomy.

                        output with other electromagnetic (e.g., gamma-ray                   
                        burst) and neutrino burst detectors,
