Abstract    :
              9220108  Stith    A new pathway for the induction of meiotic cell division was 
              suggested when a phorbol ester was found to induce meiosis in  Xenopus oocytes.
               It is known that phorbols act through protein  kinase C, but the pathway to
              cell division beyond protein kinase C  is not known.  Protein kinase C is also
              believed to be involved in  the proliferative pathway of ras p21, insulin,
              insulin-like growth  factor-1 (IGF-1) and some other growth factors.  Since
              phorbols,  ras p21, insulin and IGF-1 initiate meiotic cell division in 
              Xenopus laevis oocytes, we will examine whether PKC acts through  regulation of
              one or more of four different cell cycle regulatory  proteins.  With both in
              vivo and in vitro studies, the  phosphorylation, amount and activity of ras
              p21, mos, cyclin, and  p34cdc2 will be examined as a function of protein kinase
              C  activity.  It may be found that only one isozymic form of PKC is  central to
              the regulation of proliferation and that PKC induces  cell division through
              regulation of specific protein(s).  This  research should elucidate heretofore
              uncharacterized steps in the  pathway to cell division.  %%%  Certain plant
              products, phorbol esters, induce cell division in  animal cells.  These
              chemicals activate an enzyme known as protein  kinase C (PKC).  The function of
              protein kinase C is to transfer   phosphate groups onto other proteins.  Much
              evidence suggests that  growth hormones such as insulin, insulin-like growth
              factor 1 and  epidermal growth factor induce cell division by activating
              protein  kinase C.  The steps beyond activation of protein kinase C which  lead
              to cell division are not known.  A separate line of research  over the past
              five years has been the search for genes and proteins  important to cell
              division.  Some of the newly discovered proteins  are called mos, cyclin,
              p34cdc2 and ras p21.  The goals of this  research are: (a) to determine whether
              protein kinase C can  transfer phosphate to these proteins in a test tube or in
              living  cells, (b) if i t does, to locate the site of phosphate addition to 
              these proteins, and (c) determine whether these important cell  division
              proteins are turned on or off by the addition of  phosphate.  The results of
              this research should define new steps in  the sequence of events that leads to
              induction of cell division by  growth factors.  Since this research will be
              carried out at an  undergraduate institution with the participation of
              students, it  will also contribute to training a future generation of
              scientists.  ***
