Abstract    :
                   The northern Sierra terrane of California contains                        
              extensive exposures of a Jurassic volcano-plutonic                             
              assemblage that formed on the Pacific margin of north                          
              American.  If offers the possibility  of placing tight                         
              limits on the timing of tectonic events including arc                          
              magmatism, metamorphism and deformation associated with                        
              building of the arc and its subsequent development and final                   
              destruction.  The work involves using fossil ages and                          
              extensive radiometric age determinations from various phases                   
              of the plutonic assemblage.  When integrated with other                        
              data, the detailed chronology of structural and magmatic                       
              events established for the study area will allow rigorous                      
              comparison with other mid-Mesozoic terranes in the Sierra                      
              and will help evaluate regional tectonic models.
