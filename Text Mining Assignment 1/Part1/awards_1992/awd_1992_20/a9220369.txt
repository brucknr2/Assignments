Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  Fast local motions will be studied by molecular dynamics                  
              simulations.  The results will be incorporated into the dynamic                
              rotational isomeric state formalism in order to extend the time                
              scale and the size of the systems examined.  Two types of systems              
              will be studied.  The first type consists of polymeric hydrocarbons            
              severely constrained by channels.  Here the project will focus on              
              the influence of torsional oscillations on the orientation                     
              autocorrelation functions, and the creation, lifetimes, migration,             
              and destruction of conformational defects arising from independent,            
              or correlated, conformational transitions.  The second type of                 
              system consists of polyesters with a variety of spacers between                
              aromatic units, and aromatic units that have fluorescence lifetimes            
              shorter than, or longer than, the time scales of the molecular                 
              dynamics simulations.  Fluorescence measurements will be performed             
              for the polyesters under conditions where the internal dynamics is             
              important.  The overall objective is to increases the time scales,             
              and the sizes of systems, susceptible to attack by atom-based                  
              studies of the internal dynamics.                                              
                                                                                             
              Polyesters are important industrial materials, and this research               
              seeks to relate the motions of the molecules to the observed                   
              properties.  Both computer modeling and critical experiments will              
              be part of the investigation.
