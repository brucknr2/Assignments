Abstract    :
              Recent discoveries of gold and platinum group (PGE)                            
              mineralization in Eocene layered gabbros of East Greenland                     
              demonstrate that physical and chemical processes associated                    
              with the transition from continental to oceanic rifting can                    
              concentrate precious metals in the Earth's crust.  One of                      
              these gabbros, the Kap Edvard Holm Complex, exhibits an                        
              unusual combination of features related to stratiform                          
              precious metal mineralization.  An understanding of these                      
              processes requires detailed field, petrologic, isotopic, and                   
              chemical analyses, combined with theoretical analysis of the                   
              thermodynamic and transport characteristics of magma-                          
              hydrothermal systems. The long-term plans for this research                    
              program involve using these techniques to provide new                          
              insights into the nature of processes controlling:  1)                         
              precious metal concentration during gabbro crystallization;                    
              and 2) precious metal transport and deposition in gabbro-                      
              hosted hydrothermal systems.  A specific objective of the                      
              research will be evaluation of various hypotheses that may                     
              explain the unusually high ratio of precious metal to                          
              sulfide that is characteristic of this deposit.                                
              Investigation of the processes responsible for                                 
              mineralization in the East Greenland gabbros is potentially                    
              of great importance to understanding the global distribution                   
              of precious metals and to formulating future mineral                           
              exploration strategies.
