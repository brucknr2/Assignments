Abstract    :
              Theoretical research will be conducted on various aspects of                   
              systems which have topological quantum numbers.  Research on the               
              quantum Hall effect will be continued and the question of where the            
              current is generated in a Hall device should be clarified.  Work on            
              the analogy between the quantum Hall effect in a two-dimensionally             
              modulated system and the theory of phase transitions will also be              
              continued.  New work on the motion of quantized vortices in                    
              superfluid helium at very low temperatures is being started.  A                
              comprehensive review of topological quantum numbers will be                    
              written.                                                                       
              %%%                                                                            
              Theoretical research will be conducted on the meaning and cause of             
              various quantum effects.  Systems to be investigated include the               
              two-dimensional electron gas and its manifestation through the                 
              quantum Hall effect and superfluid helium.  The influence of                   
              various defect structures, such as vortices, will be the focus of              
              this work.
