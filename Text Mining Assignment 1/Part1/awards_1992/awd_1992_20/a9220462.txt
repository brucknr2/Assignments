Abstract    :
              9220462  THOMPSON  This award supports the U.S. portion of a joint U.S. - New
              Zealand  seismic investigation of the sediment stratigraphy beneath the East 
              Antarctic Ice Sheet from the Transantarctic Mountains into the  Wilkes
              Subglacial Basin.  The scientific objectives are:  1) to test, and provide
              constraints for, uplift models of the  Transantarctic Mountains by imaging the
              stratigraphic structure of  the west side of the Transantarctic Mountains, 2)
              to  constrain models of the origin of Ferrar magmas by determining the 
              geographic extent of this unit under the East Antarctic Ice Sheet  so that
              models of magmatism, involving mantle plume activity versus  melting in
              response to regional rifting, can be evaluated,  and 3) to help resolve the
              debate about the climatic conditions and  size of the East Antarctic Ice Sheet
              in the late Cenozoic by  determining if the Wilkes Basin contains marine
              sediments that  could have been a source of material for the Sirius Formation,
              a  till containing Pliocene diatoms which is located at many high  altitude
              locations in the Transantarctic Mountains.  ***
