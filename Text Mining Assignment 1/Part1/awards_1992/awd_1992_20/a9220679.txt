Abstract    :
              The focus of this research will be on intramolecular 3+2 and                   
              4+3 cycloaddition recations of allyl cations with dienes.                      
              Alkoxyallylic alcohols, cyclopropane hemiacetals and allylic                   
              sulfoxides will be used as progenitors of allylic cations.  A                  
              detailed study of regioselectivity and relative stereochemistry                
              will be made in the context of the synthesis of fused 6,7 and                  
              6,5 bicyclic ring systems.

              With this Renewal award, the Synthetic Organic Program is                      
              supporting the research of Professor Michael Harmata of the                    
              Department of Chem,istry at the University of Missouri,                        
              Columbia.  Dr. Harmata will focus his work on developing a                     
              class of reactions known as cycloadditions for the purpose of                  
              constructing compounds containing 5,6 and 7-membered rings,                    
              structures often occuring in important natural products.
