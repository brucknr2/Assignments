Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Over the past decade, considerable experience has accumulated in               
              using the tools of national research management, including                     
              strategic planning, technology assessment, and performance                     
              evaluation. As an essential element of this set, retrospective                 
              research assessment at the program level, has received increasing              
              attention among decision makers and managers in most industrialized            
              nations--except perhaps the United States.                                     
                                                                                             
              Research assessment is  likely to be of greater interest in the                
              United States in the years ahead and this project will provide a               
              systematic overview of past assessment studies, plus an examination            
              of the uses to which past assessment results have been put.  The               
              project will proceed in two phases: first, a codification of                   
              approaches taken in past studies, and second, an evaluation of                 
              those approaches with suggestions for improvement to fit the U.S.              
              context.  The second stage will culminate in a colloquium, to be               
              held in Washington, D.C., involving decision makers, analysts,                 
              research managers, and assessment experts.
