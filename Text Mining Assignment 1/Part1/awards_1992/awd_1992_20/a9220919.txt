Abstract    :
                   Little knowledge exists about the role of antibiotics in                  
              fungal life cycles an activities.  One hypothesis is that                      
              antibiotics are important determinants of competitive                          
              interactions among fungi; experimental evidence to support this                
              hypothesis, however is lacking.  A freshwater fungal community on              
              wood will be used experimentally determine: (1) the degree to                  
              which competition occurs among fungal species; (2) how the                     
              competitive ability of initial colonizers influences the                       
              development of fungal communities over time; and (3) whether the               
              ability of fungi to produce antifungal antibiotics confers a                   
              competitive advantage.  Competition will be assessed by pre-                   
              colonizing wood in the laboratory with pairs of species                        
              (antibiotic producers and non-producers) in various proportions                
              at different densities and then submerging the wood in a stream.               
              Species reproduction over time will be measured as an indicator                
              of species success.                                                            
              %%%                                                                            
              Results should demonstrate the degree to which competition                     
              occurs, the role of competition in organizing fungal communities,              
              how well species interaction in culture predict species                        
              interactions in the field, the relative importance of antibiotic               
              production in fungal species interactions, and the process and                 
              pattern of fungal colonization of submerged wood.  This knowledge              
              will contribute to understanding the role of competition, the                  
              evolutionary significance of antibiotic production, and life                   
              strategies of saprophytic organisms.
