Abstract    :
              High Pressure Liquid Chromatography allows the quantitative                    
              analysis of many biologically important materials like                         
              derivatized amino acids, oligopeptides, phenolics, polar                       
              terpenoids, and coumarin allelochemicals that are too heavy                    
              for gas chromatographic separation.  The proposed HPLC                         
              system will support the research of at least five faculty                      
              lab groups in the new University of Minnesota Ecology                          
              Building, including investigations of plant/herbivore                          
              interactions and plant secondary products.
