Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The goal of the proposed work is to gain a detailed understanding              
              of the biochemical processes by which a product from the ovary                 
              initiates sex pheromone production in the common housefly. The                 
              housefly sex pheromone is a chemical attractant produced by the                
              female to attract males for mating. A better understanding of sex              
              pheromone production is needed to take advantage of this essential             
              form of chemical communication in insects. The regulation of sex               
              pheromone production in insects occurs via a brain factor in                   
              Lepidoptera, by juvenile hormones in cockroaches and beetles and by            
              ecdysteroids in the housefly and perhaps in other Diptera. In none             
              of these systems is it clearly understood which enzyme activities              
              are affected to control sex pheromone production. The work proposed            
              here is designed to gain a clear understanding of the enzymes                  
              influenced by ecdysone which result in sex pheromone production and            
              to provide the basic information necessary to develop insect                   
              control strategies based on inhibiting sex pheromone production.
