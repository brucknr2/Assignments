Abstract    :
                   Many human diseases and also many biologically interesting                
              and economically important traits in higher organisms and farm                 
              animals and plants are controlled by multiple genes.  Genetic                  
              dissection and mapping of these genes on chromosomes have always               
              been an important aim of quantitative genetics as it could lead                
              to a better understanding of the structure of polygenic systems                
              and also to identification of major chromosome regions for                     
              further genetic study, genetic engineering or selection.  To map               
              quantitative trait loci (QTLs) accurately, a complete linkage map              
              is necessary and is now made possible with the rapid advance of                
              recombinant DNA technology.                                                    
                   There have been many statistical methods proposed for                     
              mapping QTLs, notably the interval mapping method proposed by                  
              Lander and Botstein, but none of them has taken a full use of                  
              complete linkage map information on mapping QTLs.  This project                
              proposes to study an alternative mapping strategy which combines               
              the interval mapping with an interval test.  This method will be               
              able to test for a QTL on a marker interval independent of the                 
              effects of QTLs at other regions of chromosomes and thus will be               
              asymptotically unbiased.  Also by using a general linear model,                
              the whole map information will be used simultaneously in making                
              statistical inferences about locations and effects of QTLs and                 
              the efficiency of the test will be increased.                                  
                   This project also proposes to study a more general polygenic              
              mutation model for the study of evolution of quantitative traits.              
              With this model the expected genetic variances within and between              
              finite populations and the response of populations to selection                
              with reference to molecular evolution will be studied.//
