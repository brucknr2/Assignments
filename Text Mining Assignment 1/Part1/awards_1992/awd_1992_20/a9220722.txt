Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This grant will support the participation of junior investigators              
              and students in the FASEB summer research conference on Lymphocytes            
              and Antibodies.  This will be a small meeting with a strong                    
              scientific program covering a number of selected topics of intense             
              current interest and activity in basic immunobiology.  The small               
              size and residential arrangements of the meeting allows extensive              
              discussion among the participants who share a multidisciplinary                
              interest in problems of specific recognition and regulation in                 
              immune function.
