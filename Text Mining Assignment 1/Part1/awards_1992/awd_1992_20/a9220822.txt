Abstract    :
                   This research evaluates how attached aquatic microflora                   
              (periphyton) regulate (1) the rates of deposition of organic                   
              carbon that is imported from upland areas or synthesized by                    
              aquatic plants and algae in these regions , and (2) the retention              
              or loss rates of organic carbon.  The microbiota accomplish this               
              regulation by a combination of intensive  decomposition of                     
              dissolved organic carbon to CO2 and methane and by burying a                   
              significant portion of microbial biomass that does not decompose.              
              High metabolism and growth results from intensive recycling of                 
              nutrients within the communities.  The research program will                   
              examine natural communities under replicated experimental                      
              conditions for:  (1) Metabolic and community carbon retention and              
              decomposition to CO2 and methane in response to substratum.  (2)               
              Resistance to nutrient limitations of phosphorus and nitrogen and              
              the effects on carbon losses.  (3) Effects of different types of               
              dissolved organic compounds on metabolic recycling and carbon                  
              losses.  (4) Determination of lateral microscale fluxes of                     
              nutrients within these attached communities.

              Wetland/ littoral and floodplain land-water interface regions of               
              lake and river ecosystems are being recognized as major                        
              depositional areas for organic carbon.  Organic carbon storage                 
              versus evolution of metabolized carbon in the form of CO2 and                  
              methane is important because these 'greenhouse' gases are                      
              critical to global climate change evaluations. ***//
