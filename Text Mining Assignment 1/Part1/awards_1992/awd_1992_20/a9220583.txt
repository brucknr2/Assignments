Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  Small strongly flying insects need not fly at high, narrow                
              body temperatures, in terms of the balance of their heat gain or               
              loss. Yet in fact they do so, and even have a variety of complex               
              adaptations for actively regulating body temperature to high and               
              narrow ranges. We will complete the study of how this thermal                  
              regulation works during flight itself, and how body temperature                
              variation affects actual flight performance. To do this, we will               
              first complete the construction of a computerized wind tunnel in               
              which to carry out our experiments. Experimental use of this tool              
              to examine a variety of specific issues in the heat-transfer                   
              biophysics and the temperature-dependence of flight lift and thrust            
              will follow. We will also test an entirely new concept of  why it              
              is that intense animal activity, such as insect flight, is so                  
              invariably limited in its range of effective temperatures.                     
                   This work will be important to a number of issues in basic                
              biology, all revolving around the reasons why animals regulate                 
              their body temperatures, the range of ways in which they can do so,            
              and their adaptations for making strenuous and demanding activity              
              more efficient. It may also be extremely important to considering              
              the possible damaging effects of global climate change, especially             
              global warming, which may alter the thermal environments of such               
              sensitive animals on a time scale much shorter than that of their              
              ability to adjust.
