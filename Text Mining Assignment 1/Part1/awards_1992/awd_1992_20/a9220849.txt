Abstract    :
                   This study will examine the environmentally-induced                       
              flexibility in the life history of the sailfin molly.  It is                   
              obvious that almost any animal's life history is malleable by                  
              environmental effects such as temperature or food level.                       
              However, two aspects of that malleability are not well                         
              understood.  First, there is increasing evidence that the pattern              
              of environmental sensitivity varies among different populations                
              of the same species.  Second, it is unclear whether natural                    
              selection has molded those different patterns of sensitivity and,              
              if it has, how it has done so.  These two basic questions will be              
              addressed by this research.                                                    
                   There are several ways in which the lessons from this study               
              may be applied to other problems.  First, conservation biology is              
              focusing increasingly on how to restore viable populations of a                
              species to an area from which it has been extirpated.  This work               
              will help document how "interchangeable" are individuals from                  
              different populations of the same species and thereby whether it               
              is ever advisable to draw colonists from a population elsewhere                
              in the species' range.  Second, one of the major aspects of life               
              history of this fish is its accrual and use of fat stores.  This               
              work will examine the genetic and environmental control of fat                 
              accrual and may lead to the use of fish models instead of mice as              
              a less expensive system for studying some aspects of the control               
              of fat metabolism.//
