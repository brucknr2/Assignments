Abstract    :
              The extreme environment of Antarctica provides a unique                        
              opportunity to study adaptation of organisms to cold as well as                
              dry conditions.  This research will focus on an Antarctic yeast                
              (Leucosporidium  sp.) as a model system to study cellular                      
              function and regulation at the molecular level through the                     
              isolation of genes required for cold adaptation.  Before genes                 
              necessary to examine these processes will be cloned, a                         
              transformational system, including a mechanism for the recovery                
              of isolated DNA, will be developed for Leucosporidium.                         
              Antibiotic resistance markers on plasmid or cosmid vectors will                
              be utilized to follow the introduction of exogenous DNA into this              
              system and plasmid or cosmid DNA will be re-isolated from the                  
              transformed yeast to insure replication fidelity after                         
              transformation.  This project will lead to the application of the              
              techniques of RNA subtraction and complementation of induced                   
              mutations to isolate those genes which are either constitutively               
              regulated by life in the cold or variably regulated for                        
              adaptation to a changing cold environment.
