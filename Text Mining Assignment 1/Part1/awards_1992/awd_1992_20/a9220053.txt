Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Prediction from ungauged basins (PUB) is a classic unsolved problem            
              in river basin hydrology which has increasingly important                      
              implications for making regional hydrologic predictions due to                 
              global climate change. The basic approach towards a solution of                
              this problem requires a deep understanding of empirical and                    
              theoretical issues surrounding scaling in hydrologic fluxes, the               
              network geometry and their interretionships, and constitutes the               
              main focus of the research proposed here.  The three broad but                 
              specific objectives of the proposed research are to develop and                
              test scaling theories of spatial variability, (i) in hydrologic                
              fluxes in river basins, (ii) in link based descriptions of three-              
              dimensional channel network geometry, and (iii)  to establish and              
              employ appropriate data bases for a few select basins for testing              
              theoretical hypotheses and predictions.  A portion of this total               
              project was funded in part for three years by NASA beginning July              
              1991.  This is shown in Appendix IV.  The budget for NSF                       
              complements the fund provided by NASA.
