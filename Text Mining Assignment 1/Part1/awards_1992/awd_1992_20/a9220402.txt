Abstract    :
                   This grant covers two Northeastern groups formerly funded                 
              under separate grants who have combined on this grant,                         
              continuing a trend toward consolidation begun in 1989.  Group                  
              members participate in D0 at the Tevatron, L3 at LEP - both                    
              taking data, E706 at FNAL whose run has ended, and SMC at CERN                 
              that will run again next year as well as in SDC for the SSC.                   
              They also are engaged in R&D studies on fiber tracking.
