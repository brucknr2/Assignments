Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              A long-term study of tree populations in tropical and                          
              subtropical rain forest in Australia has been carried                          
              on for 29.5 years.  The objective is to elucidate the                          
              mechanisms that are responsible for the high diversity                         
              of species as well as the variety of population                                
              structures (age and size distributions, spatial                                
              patterns, life histories) seem in these forests.                               
              Trees, saplings and seedlings were identified, tagged                          
              and mapped in 1963-65.  In subsequent censuses between                         
              1963 and 1992 the growth and mortality of tagged plants                        
              were determined, and newly recruited tree seedlings                            
              recorded.  These data yield rates of recruitment,                              
              growth and mortality of all sizes of all species of                            
              trees.  Other measurements included the timing and                             
              location of tree-falls and light gaps and the structure                        
              of the overstory canopy.                                                       
                                                                                             
              It is planned to continue this study for at least                              
              another 2 decades, for the following reasons: 1) to                            
              increase the probability of measuring the effects of                           
              rate important events (e.g. extremes of weather,                               
              population explosions of different species), or of                             
              detecting gradual trends, which require long records;                          
              2) to gather information on short-term changes that                            
              will help to interpret long-term findings; 3) to obtain                        
              information over larger spatial scales to assess the                           
              generality off findings.  The significance of this                             
              research is that it should increase knowledge of the                           
              dynamics of rain forest, one of the most complex and                           
              diverse ecological communities known, which contains a                         
              high proportion of the world's terrestrial species.
