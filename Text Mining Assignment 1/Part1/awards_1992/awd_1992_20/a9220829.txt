Abstract    :
                   This project is part of an ongoing study of the function of               
              the large material donation or spermatophore transferred by male               
              monarch butterflies (Danaus plexippus) during mating.  Because                 
              there will often be a tradeoff between investment in present and               
              future matings, investment by males in more resources than are                 
              necessary to ensure fertilization in a single mating is of                     
              theoretical interest.  Two possible, but not mutually exclusive,               
              hypotheses are the focus of the project.  These are that the                   
              spermatophore provides nutrients to be used by the female in                   
              offspring production (paternal investment), or that it delays                  
              remating by the female, increasing the time during which the                   
              donating male's sperm are used to fertilize eggs (mating effort).              
              Studies of sperm competition and mating frequencies of wild                    
              butterflies will allow estimation of the portion of a male's                   
              investment that is available to his own offspring, and relative                
              fitness gains from the nutrient and delayed remating effects of                
              spermatophores.***//
