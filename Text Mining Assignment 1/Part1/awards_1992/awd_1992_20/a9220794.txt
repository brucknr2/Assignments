Abstract    :
              This research consists of four separate, but related empirical                 
              projects aimed at increasing our understanding of altruistic                   
              behavior and household saving.  The projects examine the                       
              relationship between monetary charitable contributions and                     
              volunteer labor supply; the degree to which private intrafamily                
              transfers are affected by public transfers; the effects on                     
              household saving of the 1986 changes in the tax treatment of                   
              Individual Retirement Accounts; and the effects of borrowing                   
              constraints on household saving and the consumption of durables.               
                                                                                             
              The first study develops a theoretical model of household                      
              charitable behavior that yields several important empirical                    
              propositions.  These will be examined using data from both the                 
              1986 Survey of Consumer Finances (SCF) and a new dataset on                    
              volunteerism.  The study of intrafamily transfers will be the                  
              first to examine existing theoretical models and the                           
              responsiveness of intrafamily transfers using data from the Panel              
              Study on Income Dynamics.  The third study will use the three-way              
              SCF panel to analyze the effects of statutory changes in                       
              deductible IRA contribution limits.  It will extend the authors'               
              previous work in this area.  The last project will investigate                 
              the duration of borrowing constraints and the effects of these                 
              constraints on household saving and the consumption of durables                
              using the SCF panel.
