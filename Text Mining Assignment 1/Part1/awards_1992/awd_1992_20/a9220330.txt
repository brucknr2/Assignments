Abstract    :
              This is a unit of DOE/NSF/USDA Collaborative Research in Plant                 
              Biology Program.                                                               
                                                                                             
              The theme of the interdisciplinary research training group is root             
              biology, and is designed to nurture a group of innovative and                  
              creative scientists capable of developing and utilizing an                     
              interdisciplinary team approach to plant biology.  The three major             
              focus areas include root ecology, root biochemistry and                        
              root/organism interactions.  The group involves 13 faculty members             
              all interested in various aspects of root biology from root growth,            
              plant nutrition and nitrogen fixation to soil chemistry/physics.               
              Research training involves training of graduate students, postdocs,            
              a seminar series, retreats, an international symposium, and                    
              internships in private and government facilities.  Outreach                    
              activities include mentoring gifted high school students and                   
              professional improvement of high school teachers.  The                         
              investigators hope to develop this group into a inter-departmental             
              center for root biology at Penn State University.
