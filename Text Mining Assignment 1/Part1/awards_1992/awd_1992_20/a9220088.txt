Abstract    :
                   This award will provide 32% of the funds required to equip a              
              workstation-based seismic reflection data-processing facility in               
              the Department of Geology at Syracuse University. Syracuse                     
              University has committed the necessary remaining funds.                        
                   The computer facility will be used primarily by the Principal             
              Investigator and students in the analysis of seismic reflection                
              data and their interpretation of large-scale structures of the                 
              Earth's continental lithosphere regions.
