Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The symbiosis that develops between the sepiolid squid, Euprymna               
              scolopes, and the marine luminous bacterium, Vibrio fischeri, has              
              proven to be an effective model system with which to examine the               
              development of an animal/bacterial mutualism.  The initiation and              
              maintenance of a bacterial infection in the juveniile squid that               
              subsequently results in the complex light-emitting organ of the                
              mature squid provides a rare opportunity to discover the                       
              significance of interspecies interactions in the control of organ              
              morphogenesis, immunological response, bacterial/host recognition,             
              and the consequences of other developmentally regulated signal                 
              processes.  It exhibits strain level specificity, presents the                 
              accessibility of molecular genetics, includes a raped and complex              
              program of developmental events in the host and symbiont, and                  
              allows comparisons between axenic and symbiotic juvenile tissue                
              differentiation. This proposal will focus specifically upon: 1) the            
              temporal characteristics of symbiosis induced morphogenesis; 2) the            
              cellular basis for morphological change of the light organ; 3) the             
              expression and symbiotic roles of indicator proteins; 4) the                   
              identification of specificity determinants and colonziation                    
              factors; 5) bacterial stress response as signal for symbiotic                  
              differentiation; and 6) the temporal and spatial patterns of                   
              symbiont gene expression within the developing light organ.
