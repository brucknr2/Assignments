Abstract    :
                   This grant is for a workshop to examine the current state                 
              of understanding of the properties of the Tau lepton.  The                     
              reports will be presented by experimenters and theorists from                  
              institutions around the world.  It is the second workshop on                   
              the subject, the first having taken place in 1990 in Orsay,                    
              France.  The organizers expect an attendance of about 120                      
              physicists.
