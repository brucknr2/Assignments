Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  The goal of this work is to understand the origin of                      
              luminescence in porous silicon, and to explore the relationship                
              between luminescence and surface chemistry of this material.  The              
              first goal will be achieved by testing the three current hypotheses            
              explaining photoluminescence in porous silicon.  The second goal               
              will be achieved by observing the changes that occur in emission               
              intensity, wavelength, and lifetimes on exposure of the materials              
              to various chemical reagents such as Lewis acids or bases,                     
              electron, hole, or energy transfer agents, and polar or polarizable            
              species.  The mechanism of luminescence quenching of porous silicon            
              by gas phase species will be studied.  The silicon surface                     
              chemistry will by developed by tuning the quenching response for               
              specific adsorbates.                                                           
                                                                                             
              The unique ability of porous silicon to change its fluorescence                
              color and intensity in the presence of chemical adsorbates opens up            
              a range of possible application for gas, liquid, and biological                
              sensors.  In addition, an understanding of the fundamental                     
              photophysics of porous silicon under these conditions may lead to              
              the development of full-color flat panel electroluminescence                   
              displays.  these potential development can build on well-                      
              established silicon processing technology.  The key contribution of            
              the proposed work is that it will define the chemical and                      
              photochemical reactivity patterns of luminescent porous silicon,               
              providing the design rules for the development of such                         
              applications.
