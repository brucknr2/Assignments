Abstract    :
                   This research is the third major effort in a collaborative                
              research program on the anatomy of ray-finned fishes                           
              (actinopterygians), a group containing about half of living                    
              vertebrates.  This project concerns detailed comparative                       
              descriptions of the early embryology of a cluster of four organ                
              systems that develop at the rostral tip of the head including the              
              hypophysis (pituitary), nose, adhesive and hatching glands.  The               
              adenohypophysis has been stressed because it is both central to                
              interpreting the development and history of the vertebrate head and            
              unites studies of comparative anatomy, embryology, and                         
              endocrinology.                                                                 
              %%%                                                                            
              For approximately 50 years comparative embryology of ray-finned                
              fishes have been neglected.  The use of scanning electron                      
              microscopy and modern histology to study comprehensive series of               
              embryos of several primitive ray-finned fish will help to resolve              
              many century-old controversies.  In addition, fishes are better                
              suited for detailed embryological and developmental studies of                 
              organ systems, and the data produced from these comparative data               
              will provide valuable information that will allow one to interpret             
              patterns of development of the vertebrate head and its many organ              
              systems.
