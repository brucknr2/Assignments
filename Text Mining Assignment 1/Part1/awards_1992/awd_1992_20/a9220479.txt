Abstract    :
                   This award will provide 73% of the cost of acquiring a noble              
              gas mass spectrometer system to be installed and operated in the               
              Department of Marine Chemistry and Geochemistry at the Woods Hole              
              Oceanographic Institution. The Institution is committed to                     
              providing the remaining funds necessary for the equipment                      
              acquisition and installation.                                                  
                   The new mass spectrometer system will allow significant                   
              advances in the study of the geochemistry of noble gases in the                
              Earth's mantle, and in the application of cosmic ray surface                   
              exposure dating in Quaternary geology. The mantle studies will                 
              focus on neon, argon, and xenon isotope studies and will allow                 
              characterization of mantle sources of ocean island and ocean ridge             
              volcanism.
