Abstract    :
              Professor Stuart A. Rice is supported by a grant from the                      
              Theoretical and Computational Chemistry Program to continue his                
              studies involving liquid-liquid, and liquid-vapor interfaces.                  
              Rice will use a combination of theory and experiment to perform                
              studies of: 1) the molecular packing and properties of several                 
              phases of liquid supported monolayers; 2) the influence of a                   
              monolayer on the structure of the adjacent region of the                       
              supporting liquid; 3) the influence of the monolayer on the                    
              distribution of solutes in the adjacent region of the                          
              supporting liquid; and 4) the structural consequences of                       
              segregation of the components in a liquid-vapor interface of a                 
              metallic mixture.  Experimental studies will involve the use of                
              grazing incidence X-ray diffraction and Fourier transform                      
              infrared spectroscopy.  Simulations will involve the use of                    
              Molecular Dynamics and Monte Carlo techniques as well as                       
              Car-Parinello theory.                                                          
              %%%                                                                            
              Very little is known about the sturcture of the interface                      
              between two immiscible phases.  Many chemical and biological                   
              phenomena depend on the nature of this interface.  For example,                
              the interface between long chain amphiphiles and water is a                    
              model for biological membranes which occur in the cell wall.                   
              Professor Rice is using a combination of theoretical and                       
              experimental methods which have only recently become available                 
              to explore the detailed structure of these phase boundaries and                
              the factors which influence this structure.
