Abstract    :
              This award is the starter grant increment of Dr. Truong's                      
              Postdoctoral Fellowship in Chemistry. The research will develop                
              and apply theoretical and computational methods to study the                   
              reactive dynamics of chemical reactions in different                           
              environments. Classical dynamics and quantum dynamics will be                  
              applied to proton and hydride transfer in biological systems.                  
              Semiempirical molecular orbital methods will be modified to                    
              treat reactions in solution. New methods for describing                        
              marcromolecules on metallic surfaces will also be developed                    
              using a variational transition state theory for the purpose of                 
              probing the details of reactive dynamics in these systems.

              The theoretical prediction of environment effects on chemical                  
              reactions is important because it can result in the better                     
              understanding of the rate at which reactions occur under                       
              environmental conditions.
