Abstract    :
                9220230  Kempf  The purchase of a laser, scanning, confocal microscope is
              proposed with  a 50% cost-share by Auburn University. The microscope will be
              utilized  for research concerned with vitellogenesis and endocytosis, 
              neurodevelopment, receptor-ligand binding, the role of  compartmentalization of
              kinase and substrate during nervous system  differentiation, physiological
              function of Na/K ATPase and carbonic  anhydrace in water balance, neural
              network modeling, hypervelocity  micrometeoroid impacts, tissue cyst formation
              by parasites, high  temperature radiator technology, and the hormonal control
              of  reproductive organ differentiation. This research will use a variety of 
              techniques including 3-dimensional reconstruction, topographic imaging, 
              analysis of metabolic function via the use of vital fluorescent dyes,  and
              analysis of calcium distribution and flux. The microscope will  serve the needs
              of many faculty at Auburn University whose research  programs require the
              unique capabilities of this instrument. This  includes a number of
              investigators whose research efforts are hampered  by having to travel a
              considerable distance to University of Georgia,  Athens to gain the use of such
              a microscope. The proposed  instrumentation will be housed in the Auburn
              University Cell Science  Center where it will be readily available for use by
              the PIs submitting  this proposal, as well as by other faculty and students.
              Investigators  that have need of a confocal microscope are from a number of
              different  departments and represent diverse disciplines including
              Protozoology,  Developmental Biology, Cell Biology, Physiology, Molecular
              Biology,  Parasitology, and Electrical Engineering
