Abstract    :
              This is a multi-institutional collaborative study of selected                  
              sequences of fresh basalt flows recovered from 3 to 5-km deep drill            
              core sections from the western and eastern continental margins and             
              offshore India, and also the samples from an -800-m drill core                 
              (Jamali Well                                                                   
              Deccan volcanism.  These studies include (a) 40Ar/39Ar dating of               
              whole rock and plagioclase separates (incremental heating                      
              technique) and (b) major, minor, and trace element (XRF, INAA) and             
              Sr, Nd, and Pb isotopic analyses.  The data obtained on these                  
              unique drill core basalts will be integrated with the existing                 
              database of surface flows to generate a comprehensive model of                 
              temporal and chemical evolution for the entire Deccan province, but            
              especially for the initial phases of flood basalt activity.
