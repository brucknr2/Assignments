Abstract    :
                   This award establishes a prototype Internet connection for                
              Cooperative Extension Service (CES) offices in Arkansas.  The                  
              installation includes a router, line, modem bank and modems for six            
              extension offices.  The extension offices will reach the Internet              
              connection over toll-free lines.  This initial installation allows             
              testing of the hardware and software, as well as determination of              
              the training and support requirements.   Future phases will expand             
              the network to the almost three hundred CES agents in the State,               
              who will use the Internet connection to access databases and other             
              information resources to allow them to respond more quickly to                 
              their clients' information requests.
