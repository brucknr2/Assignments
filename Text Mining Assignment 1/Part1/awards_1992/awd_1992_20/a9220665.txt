Abstract    :
                   Laboratory experiments using Protists will test two alternate             
              ideas about the limits to food chain length:  dynamic fragility of             
              longer chains versus interactions between productivity and the                 
              efficiency of energy transfer between trophic levels.  A second                
              series of experiments will test the contributions of environmental             
              variation and storage effects to the maintenance of high ciliate               
              diversity in ephemeral rain pools and their laboratory                         
              counterparts.  A third set of experiments will explore the role of             
              coevolution in producing observed temporal patterns of population              
              dynamics, and will examine whether the presence or absence of                  
              sexual reproduction affects rates of coevolution.  Other                       
              experiments will continue our ongoing investigations of the effects            
              of omnivores and species richness on web dynamics.  These                      
              experiments assemble replicated food webs of protozoans that differ            
              in the number of trophic levels, productivity, omnivory, or species            
              richness, and then evaluate the persistence and temporal                       
              variability in the abundance of each species in unmanipulated                  
              control communities and similar communities and similar communities            
              subjected to small perturbations in nutrient levels.

              This research will test food web theory which predicts relations               
              between the structure of food webs and the dynamics of their                   
              component populations.  Such information is valuable for                       
              understanding and predicting human impacts on complex aquatic                  
              communities.
