Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This U.S.-Czechoslovakia research project between Dr. Eric J.                  
              Amis of the University of Southern California and Dr. Marian                   
              Sedlak of the Institute of Experimental Physics, Slovak Academy of             
              Sciences, Kosice will examine the properties of polyelectrolytes in            
              solution without added salt.  Unscreened electrostatic interactions            
              influence polyelectrolyte behavior in complex and specific ways.               
              In this work, the researchers combine two proven methods for                   
              investigating polymer dynamics: dynamic light scattering and                   
              dynamic viscoelasticity.  The combination, with overlapping time               
              windows and unique sensitivities, should reduce the difficulties of            
              interpreting either experiment alone.  The researchers will also               
              study the   mechanism of formation of multichain domains in                    
              polyelectrolytes, with emphasis on the dependence of                           
              polyelectrolyte structure and dynamics on concentration, molecular             
              weight, charge density, electrostatic screening, chain conformation,           
              and solvent dielectric permitivities.                                          
                                                                                             
              This project in polymer research fulfills the program objective of             
              advancing scientific knowledge by enabling leading experts in                  
              Eastern Europe and the United States to combine complementary                  
              talents and pool resources in areas of strong mutual interest and              
              competence.
