Abstract    :
                   This award provides one-half the funding necessary for the                
              acquisition of a triaxial testing device to be installed and                   
              operated in the Department of Earth, Atmospheric, and Planetary                
              Sciences at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. MIT is                  
              committed to providing the remaining funds needed.                             
                   Understanding the physical properties of fluid-saturated rocks            
              at high pressures and temperatures (such as acoustic wave velocity,            
              permeability to fluids, electrical resistivity, and mechanical                 
              strength) will be made possible with the new generation testing                
              device.
