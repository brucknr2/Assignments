Abstract    :
              This is a continuation of a project to develop and operate air                 
              Cherenkov telescopes at South Pole Station for the purpose of                  
              studying discreet astrophysical sources of very high energy (VHE)              
              gamma rays.  The project is called Gamma-ray Astronomy at South                
              Pole (GASP).  The primary instrument consists of an array of                   
              parabolic mirrors, with photomultiplier tubes at their foci, which             
              can detect light from VHE interactions in a small volume of the                
              atmosphere.  The experiment is expected to shed light on the origin            
              of cosmic rays and possibly on sources of exotic radiation, if such            
              radiation exists.                                                              
                                                                                             
              GASP complements the pre-existing South Pole Air Shower Experiment             
              (SPASE), which is operated by the Bartol Research Institute of the             
              University of Delaware and Leeds University (UK), and extends                  
              downward by two to three orders of magnitude the energy threshold              
              of SPASE.  SPASE can survey most of the southern sky, and GASP will            
              be able to focus on small regions of suspected activity.                       
                                                                                             
              The location at South Pole allows GASP to view a single object for             
              extended periods (weeks to months) through a constant thickness of             
              atmosphere, while mid-latitude locations allow only a few hours of             
              viewing at a time of a given object.  The Polar location also means            
              that the very interesting high declination southern sky is always              
              within view, which gives GASP a great advantage over any mid-                  
              latitude observatory.                                                          
                                                                                             
              The project is a collaboration of the University of Wisconsin,                 
              Purdue University and the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory.               
              It is jointly funded by NSF's Office of Polar Programs and the                 
              Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory.
