Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Plant morphogenesis relies on the continued proliferation and                  
              differentiation of cells derived from the shoot apical meristem. In            
              response to a variety of signals, cells in the shoot apical                    
              meristem convert from vegetative to floral growth. This switch is              
              accompanied by a number of morphological and biochemical changes,              
              resulting in a change in the pattern of organ initiation and the               
              type of organ that is formed. In addition, intercellular signals               
              appear to be required for establishing the floral pattern. Dr.                 
              Irish proposes to investigate these processes in Arabidopsis by                
              characterizing some of the key genes required for establishing both            
              the floral pattern of organogenesis and specific tissue identities.            
              She will take two approaches to address these problems. By using               
              both molecular and genetic techniques, she hopes to clarify the                
              pathway(s) involved in establishing the floral pattern by defining             
              new genes required to specify the first steps in floral                        
              morphogenesis. In addition she proposes clonal analysis experiments            
              aimed at testing the cellular autonomy of previously characterized             
              mutations, which allow her to define the gene products involved in             
              cell-cell signalling mechanisms required for the development of the            
              floral pattern.
