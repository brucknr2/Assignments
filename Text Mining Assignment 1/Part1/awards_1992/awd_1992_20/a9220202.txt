Abstract    :
              9220202  Bloomer         This project includes a field program to geophysically
              and  geologically sample the two largest transfrom fault zones on the 
              Pacific-Antarctic plate boundary.  The principal objectives are:  (1) to
              understand the structures and tectonics of long, fast-  slipping transfrom
              faults; (2) to test structureal inferences based  largely on remotely sensed
              seismicity and satellite altimetry; (3)  to the geologic composition of the
              crustal rocks exposed in the  transforms, and (4) to exploit known outcrops of
              lower crustal and  upper mantle rocks that the usually inaccessible to dredging
              on  fast-spreading ridges.  ***August 13, 1993
