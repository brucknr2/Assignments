Abstract    :
                   The goal of the Principal Investigator is to create a                     
              hospitable environment for mathematical computation.  The word                 
              "environment" in the following sense:  It is a place where                     
              programs and people live and interact together.  As such it needs              
              the following:  Commonality.  There needs to be a rich protocol                
              that allows programs to communicate with one another and to share              
              resources.  Heterogeneity.  Programs needn't be structurally                   
              similar to one another in order to be capable of communicating.                
              Law and Order.  Programs should be protected from one another:                 
              if one acts irrationally the rest should be protected from it.                 
              Portability.  The environment should be independent of the                     
              underlying hardware, which could be a single computer or a                     
              network of such.  Flexibility.  People using one program or set                
              of programs should not be hindered by the existense of other                   
              people with other goals.  Seeds.  The environment should come                  
              populated with seedlings of useful programs.  If the environment               
              is fertile (only time can tell) these will develop into ever                   
              bigger and more fruitful things.                                               
                   This award will encourage exploratory research in this                    
              important area.
