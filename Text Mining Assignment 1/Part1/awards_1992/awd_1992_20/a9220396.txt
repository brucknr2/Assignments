Abstract    :
              The Principal Investigator (PI)                                                
              proposes to study gas mass transfer                                            
              from microbubbles.  Microbubbles,                                              
              also known as colloidal gas aphrons,                                           
              are surfactant-stabilized bubbles                                              
              about 50 microns in diameter that                                              
              are formed using a spinning-disk                                               
              apparatus.  Predictive models of                                               
              microbubble mass transfer and                                                  
              coalescence are to be developed, and                                           
              rates of gas mass transfer and                                                 
              bubble coalescence are to be                                                   
              measured for a range of surfactant                                             
              types.  The utility of microbubble                                             
              dispersions for synthesis-gas                                                  
              fermentations is also to be studied.                                           
              Fermentation productivities using                                              
              conventional gas sparging and                                                  
              microbubble sparging will be                                                   
              compared.  Productivities of these                                             
              fermentations is currently limited                                             
              by the slow rate of gas mass                                                   
              transfer.
