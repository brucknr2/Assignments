Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The goal of this project is to understand the nature of communal               
              resource management in Indonesian villages in Aceh Province,                   
              Sumatra.  It will provide a detailed focus on a small scale                    
              cattle production system that is expanding due to increasing                   
              external market demand for beef.  The effect of this intensified               
              demand will be analyzed in terms of changes in the communal land               
              tenure system and consequences for environmental quality.  Aside               
              from addressing scientific concerns of the stability of communal               
              resource systems and the mechanisms (e.g., indigenous knowledge                
              and household participation) that regulate such systems in the                 
              face of external market forces, the information gained should                  
              provide useful information for development planners.
