Abstract    :
                   Little is known about the frequency and outcome of genetic                
              recombination in natural populations of single-celled organisms.               
              In one group of single-celled organisms, the ciliated protists,                
              genetic recombination occurs by means of conjugation.  Unlike                  
              genetic recombination in plants and animals, conjugation is                    
              disconnected from reproduction, which occurs by simple binary                  
              fission.  Conjugation is a rejuvenating event that initiates a new             
              life cycle.                                                                    
                   This research combines field and laboratory studies of                    
              conjugation and multiple mating types in the ciliate Tetrahymena               
              thermophila.  This species, which has seven mating types, is widely            
              used in molecular biology but its ecology is poorly known.  We will            
              test two hypotheses:  first, that conjugation occurs frequently in             
              natural populations, and second, that the frequencies of the mating            
              types are determined by both genotype and by the temperature of the            
              environment.  The results will provide increased understanding of              
              an ecologically important group of protists, and will be relevant              
              to the ongoing debate over the origin and implications of sexual               
              reproduction and genetic recombination.//
