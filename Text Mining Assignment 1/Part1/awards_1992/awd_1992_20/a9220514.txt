Abstract    :
              This application is a request for partial support of a conference              
              entitled "Anaerobic Dehalogenation and Its Environmental                       
              Implications" to be held at the Georgia Continuing Education                   
              Center, University of Georgia, Athens, GA.  The tentative dates of             
              the conference are Aug. 30 to Sept 4, 1992.  Additional support for            
              the conference is being request from the Environment Protection                
              Agency, the Department of Energy, the National Institute for                   
              Environmental Health Sciences, and General Electric Company,                   
              Corporate Research and Development.  The Co-Chairs of the                      
              conference are Dr. John Rogers, EPA, and Dr. Dan Abramowicz,                   
              General Electric.  The Organizing Committee of the conference                  
              consists of Drs. Hugh Russell, EPA, Joe Suflita, Univ. Oklahoma,               
              Lily Young, NYU Medical Center, and Alexander Zehnder, Wageningen.

              Recent exciting developments in microbial mediated dehalogenation              
              of toxic contaminants and interest in biomediation as a strategy               
              for environmental clean-up underscore a need for an international              
              conference on these new developments.  This conference will focus              
              specifically on microbial dehalogenation processes with the aim of             
              integrating and advancing our understanding on this process.
