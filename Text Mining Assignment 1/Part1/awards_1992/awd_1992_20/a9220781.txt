Abstract    :
              This is a proposal to purchase equipment for animal behavior                   
              studies.  The equipment to be obtained includes video                          
              cameras, monitors, video tracking systems, computers and                       
              additional image processing and storage devices.   The                         
              equipment will allow the Department of Ecology, Evolution                      
              and Behavior to pursue new controlled laboratory studies                       
              that had not been possible before.  Research will focus on                     
              circadian rhythms,  cooperative behavior, mate choice, and                     
              movement patterns.  The instrumentation will enable                            
              automated monitoring of physiology, activity and coloration.                   
              Image grabbers will also be used to catalogue representative                   
              examples of behavior that can then be used to train students                   
              in classifying behavior and to ensure interobserver                            
              reliability.  The University of Minnesota sponsors two                         
              programs that encourage undergraduate research:  the                           
              Undergraduate Research Opportunity Program and a research                      
              oriented honors.
