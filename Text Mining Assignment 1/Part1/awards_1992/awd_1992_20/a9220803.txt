Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This U.S.-Czechoslovakia Joint Fund Research on "Energetic                     
              Particles Inside and Outside the Magnetosphere" is between Dr.                 
              Karel Kudela of the Institute of Experimental Physics, Slovak                  
              Academy of Sciences, and Drs. David Sibeck and A.T.Y. Lui of                   
              the Applied Physics Laboratory, Johns Hopkins University.  The                 
              Czechoslovak Institute of Experimental Physics ?IEP! will prepare              
              measurements of energetic particles in space on the high apogee                
              satellites of the Prognoz type in the frame of international space             
              physics projects.  IEP has measurements from Prognoz-8 and 10                  
              satellites and it is preparing the devices and the program of                  
              measurements for the satellites Interball and Relict-2.  The Johns             
              Hopkins University participants, very experienced in the study of              
              the magnetosphere, will provide the energetic particle data from the           
              existing satellites IMP, CCE, IRM and the GEOTAIL project now                  
              in preparation.  The researchers will (1) compare IMP-8 and CCE                
              particle data with those of Prognoz-10 (for 1992 and partly 1993);             
              and (2) compare measurements of energetic particles in GEOTAIL                 
              and on Interball (1993 and 1994).  The results should contribute to            
              understanding dynamic processes in the magnetosphere of the Earth              
              and beyond.                                                                    
                                                                                             
              This research in experimental physics fulfills the program objective           
              of advancing science by enabling leading experts in the United                 
              States and Czechoslovakia to combine complementary talents and                 
              pool research resources in areas of strong mutual interest and                 
              competence.
