Abstract    :
              The high resolution structures of several positive-sense RNA                   
              viruses, both rod-shaped and iscosahedral, have now been                       
              determined, and the molecular events in the assembly of rod-                   
              shaped RNA viruses have been characterized in great detail                     
              through the study of tobacco mosaic virus (TMV).  By                           
              comparison, relatively little is known about the protein: RNA                  
              and protein: protein interactions which direct the assembly of the             
              icosahedral RNA viruses.  The experiments proposed here are                    
              designed to determine the RNA sequence and structure of the                    
              southern bean mosaic virus SBMV coat protein-binding site, and to              
              characterize the rp-complex.  The results will provide a detailed              
              picture of the specific interaction between RNA and protein in the             
              initiation event of icosahedral virus assembly, and they will also             
              be relevant to the study of RNA: protein interactions in general.              
              In addition, the proposed experiments will directly test the models            
              for icosahedral virus assembly and will allow comparisons to be                
              made between SBMV assembly and the assembly of another small RNA               
              virus, turnip crinkle virus (TVC), with the PI has worked as a                 
              postdoctoral fellow.                                                           
              %%%                                                                            
              Viral assembly is a key component in virus-host interactions.  This            
              project will contribute toward our understanding the host range and            
              symptom severity of this group of plant virus and the economically             
              important plant disease they cause.       //
