Abstract    :
              The F1 ATPase is large, membrane-associated protein which                      
              links an equilibrium reaction between the two adenine                          
              nucleotides, adenosine triphosphate and adenosine                              
              diphosphate, and the translocation of protons across the                       
              membrane.  Thus, with a suitable proton electrochemical                        
              potential difference across the membrane it can drive the net                  
              synthesis of adenosine triphosphate.  This system will be                      
              studied by phosphorous solid state nuclear magnetic                            
              resonance.  Attempts will be made to detect intermediates in the               
              reaction and to measure rates of reaction.  Attempts will also be              
              made to determine distances between a bound metal ion required                 
              for reactions (manganese will be substituted for                               
              magnesium) and the phosphate groups of the nucleotide.

              The overall goal of this work is to define the structure and                   
              kinetics of the active site of the enzyme in situ; previous                    
              studies have relied on extraction techniques which may not                     
              reflect the true concentrations of reactants on the enzyme                     
              itself.  Longer term aims of this study are to extend the NMR                  
              experiments and measure the proximity of specific amino acid                   
              residues on the protein to the bound adenine nucleotides.
