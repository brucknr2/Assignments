Abstract    :
                   The award is for theoretical studies important for the                    
              interpretation and understanding of experimental data on                       
              cosmic-ray extensive air showers and neutrino fluxes.  The group               
              of two senior faculty, together with a post-doctoral associate                 
              focus on calculations of neutrino interaction rates in the                     
              various detectors, further development of a model to calculate                 
              particle interactions at high energies and determination of the                
              primary composition of cosmic-rays at . 1014 eV.  That last is to              
              be compared with expectations based on hypothesized acceleration               
              mechanisms.
