Abstract    :
              The proposed research utilizes a variety of accelerators in the                
              U.S., Canada and Europe to study intermediate and high energy                  
              nuclear reactions.  These studies examine both the dynamics of                 
              the nuclear reactions and the degrees of freedom required to                   
              describe the structure of the nuclear states.  The major emphasis              
              of the program will involve studies of electromagnetic processes.              
              In particular with the expected completion of CEBAF accelerator                
              in 1994, much of the effort will be directed toward the                        
              experiments associated with the CEBAF.  An additional project                  
              involves the construction of a recoil neutron polarimeter (HARP)               
              which will be used at NIKHEF and CEBAF.  The proposed                          
              experiments, at CEBAF as well as NIKHEF and MIT-Bates, address                 
              physics questions ranging from the determination of nuclear                    
              structure functions to nucleon-nucleon correlations in nuclei to               
              the underlying quark structure of baryon resonances.  An                       
              experiment at even higher energy to measure J/Psi production in                
              nuclei is being contemplated. Hadron-induced studies at other                  
              facilities will tend to emphasize the measurement of polarization              
              observable, either with polarized incident particles, polarized                
              nuclear targets, or both.  Such measurements provide additional                
              constraints and information on the medium corrections to the                   
              interactions and the role of relativity in the processes.
