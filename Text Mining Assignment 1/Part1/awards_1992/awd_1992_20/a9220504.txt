Abstract    :
              9220504  Thompson    A laser guided adaptive optics system will be installed at
              the Mt.  Wilson 2.5-meter (100-inch) telescope.  In its final configuration, 
              this system will allow the telescope to work at an angular  resolution close to
              the telescope's diffraction limit for all  wavelengths between 500nm and 3
              micros (resolution = 0.050 arcsec  at 500nm).  One unique feature of the
              optical system will be its  ability to simultaneously image at both visual and
              IR wavelenghts.   Another unique feature will be its use of the "conjugate
              adaptive  optics" concept in which two adaptive mirrors will be operated in 
              series, each mirror being placed at a point in the optical system  that is
              conjugate to a strongly turbulent layer in the atmosphere.   The adaptive
              optics system will be built from components similar to  (and for some
              components, identical  with) working adaptive optics  systems developed by
              Thermo-Trex Corp. for use by the U.S.  military.  The laser guide star system
              will be based on an excimer  laser already available and tested at Mt. Laguna
              Observatory.  ***
