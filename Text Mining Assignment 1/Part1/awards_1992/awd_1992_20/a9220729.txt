Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The program focuses on the thermodynamic properties of films (one              
              to several layers thick) of the so-called "quantum fluids and                  
              solids" (molecular hydrogens; atomic heliums and their mixtures),              
              formed on the solid surface of clean, very well characterized                  
              substrates.  Specific topics addressed include solidification of               
              molecular hydrogen in a monolayer, to search for a low-temperature             
              liquid phase and possible superfluidity; liquid condensation of                
              helium 4 adsorbed on hydrogen in a monolayer; fluid behavior of                
              helium 3 on a substrate of square symmetry; interfacial melting in             
              porous media; and the development of new substrates.                           
              %%%                                                                            
              This program studies the phenomenon of adsorption as it applies to             
              quantum fluids and the modification of the fluid properties                    
              occasioned by constraining them to thin layers.  Beyond advancing              
              their understanding of these very unusual fluids, the work offers              
              the possibility of discovering new phenomena in the area of                    
              superfluids.
