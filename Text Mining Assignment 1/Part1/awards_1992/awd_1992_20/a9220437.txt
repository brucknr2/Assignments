Abstract    :
              In cooperation with the National Academy of Sciences, the                      
              Earthquake Engineering Research Institute will convene a two and               
              a half day conference in the San Francisco Bay Area focusing on                
              the application of lessons learned from the 1989 Loma Prieta                   
              earthquake.  The conference will be opened to the public and                   
              information developed through prepared papers will be widely                   
              distributed to funding agencies, participants, others in the                   
              professional community, and government officials.  It is expected              
              that the conference will provide NSF and other federal agencies                
              with valuable observations on unresolved problems and serve to                 
              stimulate future research studies on high priority areas in                    
              engineering, the geosciences, and the social sciences.
