Abstract    :
              9220545  Kebabian       Carbon monoxide and nitrous oxide are important
              tropospheric  trace gases whose concentrations in the atmosphere are increasing
               annually.  High precision, simultaneous, measurements of carbon  monoxide and
              nitrous oxide can be used as a tracer for urban  activity within an air mass at
              remote locations.  This project will  attempt to develop a high resolution
              monitor for both carbon  monoxide and nitrous oxide using infrared absorption
              form a neutral  xenon laser light source.  The pulsed laser, operating on the 
              4.54um xenon line, can be zeeman split with a magnetic field of  2700 + 100
              gauss to be coincident with strong absorption lines of  both molecules.  A
              reduced pressure multipass absorption cell  coupled with this light source will
              provide sensitivity to carbon  monoxide of 0.6 ppb and nitrous oxide of 0.12ppb
              for continuous  sampling with a few seconds response time.  The final
              instrument  would be useful in tropospheric photochemical studies and long term
               monitoring applications of carbon monoxide and nitrous oxide.  ***
