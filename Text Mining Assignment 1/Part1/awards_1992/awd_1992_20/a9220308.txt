Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The Serpukhov Institute for High-Energy Physics                                
              in Protvino, outside of Moscow, has developed                                  
              plans to construct UNK, a proton-proton colliding                              
              beam accelerator at an energy intermediate                                     
              between those of the existing Tevatron collider                                
              at Fermilab and the planned next generation of                                 
              machines.  However, due to resource limitations                                
              and recent developments in Russia, the project                                 
              has become moribund.  Recent results from the                                  
              NSF-supported experiment P238, run at the CERN                                 
              SPS-Collider, suggest that the UNK asymmetric                                  
              collider project could be an important                                         
              international facility for the study of the                                    
              physics of particles which contain B or Beauty                                 
              quarks and, in particular, for the study of CP                                 
              violation.                                                                     
                                                                                             
              A team of five scientists led by Dr. Peter                                     
              Schlein of UCLA will travel to Protvino in July                                
              1992 to evaluate the status of the UNK project.                                
              In addition, a potential CP-Violation                                          
              experimental program will be discussed, and                                    
              discussions will be held on other possible                                     
              smaller scale collaborations.
