Abstract    :
              9220342  Platnick   To increase the availability to systematic biologists of one
              of the world's greatest entomological and arachnlogical collections in the
              world, funds will be used (1) to hire two assistants to help curate the
              Hymenoptera and Isoptera collections and complete a computerized database of
              primary type holdings; (2) to hire two preparators to process specimens newly
              acquired through an NSF-supported survey of insect and arachnid Biodiversity in
              southern South America, along with relevant backlog material; (3) to support
              half the costs of two-year curatorial/research appointments of specialists on
              the large beetle families Chrysomelidae and Curculionidae; (4) to purchase
              standard-sized insect storage cases, along with drawers and unit trays, to be
              installed on two levels of a newly renovated, climate-controlled,
              compactor-equipped collection facility; and (5) to purchase insect storage
              cases to accommodate large drawers currently housing Lepidoptera under less
              than desirable conditions.  ***
