Abstract    :
              A number of adhesive proteins have been found on the surfaces of               
              cells.  Understanding how these adhesive proteins work will help us            
              understand the basis of certain cell-cell interactions.  One of the            
              best studied cell adhesion molecules is the neural cell adhesion               
              molecule or N-CAM which is found on the surfaces of many nerve                 
              cells.  N-CAM was originally shown to bind directly to other N-CAM             
              molecules.  More recent work from this laboratory and others has               
              altered our picture of N-CAM-mediated adhesion by suggesting that              
              N-CAM can also bind to target molecules other that N-CAM.  This                
              would greatly broaden the range of interactions in which this                  
              molecule could participate.  Other than N-CAM itself, the                      
              identities of the molecules that are targets for N-CAM binding are             
              not yet known.  The goal of this project is to identify these                  
              target molecules and to define the chemical and cellular properties            
              of adhesion to them.  The first aim of the study will be to test               
              whether a  particular group of molecules found on cell surfaces and            
              in the extracellular matrix, namely heparan sulfate proteoglycans,             
              can act as the target for cell adhesion brought about by N-CAM.                
              These molecules have been implicated in other adhesive systems, but            
              their direct role as an adhesive target for N-CAM has not been                 
              demonstrated.  The second aim of the study will be to identify and             
              purify from cell surfaces as-yet undiscovered proteins that act as             
              targets for N-CAM binding.  This information could transform our               
              understanding of the normal and abnormal functions of N-CAM and of             
              the cellular interactions in which it is involved.***//
