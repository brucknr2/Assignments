Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  This award will continue the administrative and logistical                
              support of the U.S. Continental Scientific Drilling Program.  The              
              specific functions supported include:  (1) continued maintenance               
              and operation of the DOSECC (Drilling, Observation, and Sampling               
              of Earth's Continental Crust) drilling office at Texas A&M                     
              University, (2) maintenance and continued development of the                   
              scientific and engineering databases, (3) continued support for                
              DOSECC operations, (4) continued support of the Forum for                      
              Continental Scientific Drilling, and (5) continued support for the             
              preparation, publication and distribution of the CSD News - a                  
              newsletter.                                                                    
                   These operations are essential to ensure a coordinated U.S.               
              scientific drilling program.  Funding for CSD comes from three                 
              separate agencies, DOE, USGS and NSF.  DOSECC represents the                   
              interests of 44 Universities and 2 National Laboratories and serves            
              a central coordinating and facilitating function.
