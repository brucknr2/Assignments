Abstract    :
                   An experimental laboratory investigation of two interrelated              
              physical properties of partially molten upper mantle rocks,                    
              permeability and rheology, is proposed.  For both of these                     
              phenomena, the effects of grain-scale melt distribution, melt                  
              fraction, grain size and temperature will be studied.  Experiments             
              will be carried out on samples of olivine + basalt + clinopyroxene.            
              The permeability experiments will focus on quantifying the rate of             
              melt migration in response to capillary forces or to a temperature             
              gradient.  These experiments will yield the dependence of                      
              permeability on melt fraction and will provide constraints on the              
              permeability of rocks crystallizing in a thermal gradient.  The                
              high-temperature creep (rheology) experiments will be carried out              
              at high confining pressures in both the dislocation and diffusional            
              creep regimes, with emphasis on the former.  These measurements                
              will concentrate on the development of constitutive equations,                 
              which can be used to extrapolate from laboratory to upper mantle               
              conditions.  This experimental program will provide permeabilities             
              and rheologies for dunite, harzburgite and lherzolite.
