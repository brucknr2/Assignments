Abstract    :
                   The National Distance Learning Center (NDLC) at Owensboro                 
              Community College is establishing a connection to NSFNET via an                
              existing 1.544 million bits per second line through the University             
              of Kentucky and the SURANET mid-level network.  The connection                 
              enables the research and education community to access the NDLC                
              database over the Internet as well as by modem, as is done now.                
              Owensboro's faculty and students will also be able to communicate              
              and collaborate with the international scientific and educational              
              community, and to access network resources such as libraries,                  
              databases and supercomputers.  This award funds part of the costs              
              for two years.
