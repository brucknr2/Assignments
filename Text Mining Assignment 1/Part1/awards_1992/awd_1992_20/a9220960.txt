Abstract    :
                   The quest for a flexible and efficient knowledge                          
              representation mechanism is one of the key research problems in                
              Artificial Intelligence (AI).  Instantaneous matching of a complex             
              object description to a large set of predefined objects is a key               
              computational primitive in many intelligent systems.  This function            
              of memory based reasoning manifests itself in different activities             
              such as pattern recognition tasks in computer vision, language                 
              understanding or general problem solving.  Simultaneous                        
              satisfaction of many possibly conflicting constraints is another               
              very important functional requirement in intelligent systems, which            
              is critical for learning, planning and general problem solving.  It            
              is generally believed that humans perform such tasks efficiently               
              (i.e., in almost constant time) by exploiting massive parallelism              
              in the brain.  This research is aimed at deriving a precise                    
              characterization of the utility of parallelism in fundamental AI               
              problems such as constraint solving and matching.  The ultimate                
              goal of the research is to produce a computational framework for               
              parallel intelligent systems.  Specific research objectives are                
              design of efficient parallel algorithms for constraint networks,               
              development of methods to integrate multiple constraint solving                
              activities, and applications of generalized matching and constraint            
              solving to reactive planning, resource allocation and analysis of              
              scientific data.//
