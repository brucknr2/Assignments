Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The long-term goal of the proposed research is to understand the               
              roles of microtubule-based components of the cytoskeleton in plant             
              development.  Morphogenesis in plants is controlled primarily by               
              processes that establish the planes of cell divisions and the axes             
              of cell elongations, and three microtubule arrays unique to plant              
              cells play central roles in these morphogenetic processes.                     
              Furthermore, the absence of centrioles in plant cells makes the                
              potential role of gamma-tubulin in the nucleation of microtubules              
              of particular interest in plants.  These investigations focus on               
              the genetic control of microtubule-based processes in the model                
              plant Arabidopsis thaliana, which contains 15 characterized alpha              
              and beta-tubulin genes and at least one gamma-tubulin gene.  The               
              specific objectives of the proposed investigations are (1) to use              
              immunofluorescence or immunogold microscopy and gamma-tubulin-                 
              specific antibodies to localize gamma tubulin within cells                     
              throughout the cell cycle, (2) to characterize spatial and temporal            
              patterns of expression of the gamma tubulin gene(s) and selected               
              beta-tubulin genes, and (3) to investigate the utilization and                 
              function of the pollen-localized alpha 1-isoform by means of                   
              immunolocalization with our alpha 1-tubulin-specific antibody and              
              by analysis of transgenic plants harboring "antisense RNA" chimeric            
              genes.
