Abstract    :
                   This award will support the development of high-temperature               
              capability for a rotary direct shear rock deformation system. The              
              primary research focus is to gain knowledge of faulting/fracture               
              at depth where the ambient temperature is high. High-temperature               
              capability will also allow ductile rock deformation studies of                 
              direct shear, permitting investigations of rheological properties              
              and the development of deformation textures in rocks at very large             
              strains. Three principal areas will be addressed to add high-                  
              temperature capabilities: modification of the sample jacket,                   
              modification of the sample grips to allow space for a furnace,                 
              construction of a furnace.
