Abstract    :
              9220206  Durkovic    How does the nervous system code the results of experience
              in order  to produce adaptive changes in behavior? This is one of the most 
              fascinating questions in neuroscience research. With this NSF  grant, Dr.
              Durkovic will use sophisticated new molecular and  cellular techniques to study
              this problem in a unique model system  in the spinal cord. Traditionally, the
              spinal cord has not been  considered to be a fruitful place to study plastic
              changes. Dr.  Durkovic, however, has accumulated substantial evidence for a 
              differential response to experience by spinal flexor reflexes.  During the
              project period he will compare two different types of  reflex changes in terms
              of their synaptic connectivity and the  transmitters involved. The results of
              the proposed studies will aid  in understanding the mechanisms underlying a
              family of synaptic  facilitatory phenomena that occur as a result of
              activity-dependent  phenomena throughout the nervous system.  The findings will
              also  provide basic data relevant to the understanding of plasticity in  the
              spinal cord and the possibility of rehabilitation after injury.  ***
