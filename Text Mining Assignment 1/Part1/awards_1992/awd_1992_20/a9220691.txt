Abstract    :
                   This award will provide 52% of the funds required to acquire              
              and install a gas source isotope ratio mass spectrometer in the                
              Department of Earth and Environmental Sciences at Lehigh                       
              University. Lehigh University is committed to providing the                    
              remaining funds needed.                                                        
                   The mass spectrometer system is necessary to carry out the                
              PI's research program supported in part by the National Science                
              Foundation. The main thrust of this research is a study of the                 
              processes of crustal mass and energy transfer using field                      
              observations integrated with analytical data on the distribution               
              of the stable isotopes of carbon, oxygen, hydrogen, sulfur and                 
              nitrogen. Emphasis will be placed on the distribution of nitrogen              
              in metamorphic rocks of the Earth's crust, an area of research                 
              pioneered by the Principal Investigator. The stable isotope                    
              analytical capabilities of the new instrument will also be used in             
              biochemical and environmental studies programs at Lehigh.
