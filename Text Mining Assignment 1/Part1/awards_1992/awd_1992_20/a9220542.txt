Abstract    :
                   This award provides approximately one-half the funding                    
              required for the acquisition of an electron microprobe to be                   
              installed and operated in the Department of Geology and Geophysics             
              at the University of Minnesota. The University is committed to                 
              providing the remaining funds necessary.                                       
                   The new electron microprobe will provide state-of-the-art                 
              capabilities in quantitative chemical analysis of geological                   
              samples with spatial resolution on the order of a micrometer. A                
              group of eight faculty research groups in the Department of Geology            
              and Geophysics are actively pursuing research projects requiring               
              such capability. In addition, the instrument will be made available            
              regionally to staff/students at the Minnesota Geological Survey,               
              the Duluth campus of the University of Minnesota, the 3M Company,              
              and Honeywell.
