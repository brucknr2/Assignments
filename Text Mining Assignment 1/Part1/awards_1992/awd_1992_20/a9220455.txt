Abstract    :
              This research concerns electronic transport in ultra-small metallic            
              structures.  These are structures in which one or more dimensions              
              are of order 1000  or less.  Fundamental questions concerning                 
              electron motion in disordered systems will be investigated.  These             
              structures will also be used as tools for the study of fundamental             
              physical phenomena.  Topics which will be investigated include the             
              effects of reduced dimensionality on the behavior of magnetic                  
              impurities (Kondo effect), nonlinear behavior in the presence of               
              microwave fields,  magnetization reversal through quantum tunneling            
              in individual 100  particles, and superconductivity in one                    
              dimension.                                                                     
              %%%                                                                            
              Ultra-small metallic structures form the basis of all current                  
              microelectronic devices.  The small size of these devices is                   
              central to their high performance and low cost, and thus there is              
              a continuing desire to develop ever smaller devices.  The purpose              
              of this research is two-fold.  First, to study the fundamental                 
              properties of metallic structures with sizes below 100 nanometers.             
              While this is considerably smaller than currently available                    
              commercial devices, structures in this size range will be of great             
              importance in future generations of devices.  It is important to               
              understand the behavior of these structures, particularly since                
              they will likely exhibit new properties which are not found in                 
              larger structures.  Second, these structures will be used as tools             
              in the study of fundamental phenomena.  In many cases these                    
              structures can be used to probe effects which are not accessible               
              with larger structures.  Examples include superconductivity in one             
              dimension, and the effect of confinement on magnetic ions in                   
              metals.
