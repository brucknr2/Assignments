Abstract    :
              This award supports an integrated seismic, sedimentologic, and                 
              paleontologic investigation of glacio-marine stratigraphy of the               
              Ross Sea continental shelf.  The purpose of this work is to                    
              acquire seismic images and sediment cores of the glacial                       
              sediments toward a better understanding of the Cenozoic history                
              of glaciation in the Ross Sea region.  This investigation will                 
              utilize high resolution seismic profiling data to locate regions               
              where the Pleistocene glacial till is thin or perhaps absent.                  
              Piston coring at these locations, if the till is penetrated, will              
              provide sedimentary records of Cenozoic depositional environments              
              and could provide important clues to fluctuations of the                       
              Antarctic Ice Sheets.  The seismic profiling will provide a                    
              direct record of the grounding history of the Ross Ice Shelf                   
              during the Pleistocene and it will also allow first order                      
              correlations of Cenozoic sedimentary units that are represented                
              by sediments recovered in the piston cores.  This work will                    
              provide important proxy records of the history of both the West                
              Antarctic Ice Sheet and the East Antarctic Ice Sheet and this, in              
              turn, will provide important constraints to climate models.
