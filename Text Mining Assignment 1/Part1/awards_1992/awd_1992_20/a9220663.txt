Abstract    :
              The purpose of this project is to                                              
              develop a computational procedure                                              
              for the adaptive control of                                                    
              hazardous releases, either of water                                            
              or toxic substances.  In                                                       
              particular, the control strategy is                                            
              aimed at deliberate releases from                                              
              man-made storage or process

              catastrophic results.  The                                                     
              procedure consists of combining                                                
              two-dimensional transient models                                               
              that simulate the dynamics of the                                              
              release and its subsequent fate in                                             
              the environment and an adaptive
