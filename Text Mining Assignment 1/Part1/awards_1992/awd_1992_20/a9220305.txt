Abstract    :
              The central question addressed in this proposal is the effect of               
              pesticides on the ground water system, beyond the unsaturated                  
              zone horizon.  This will accomplished by formally linking the                  
              PRZM model with a 3-D ground water model, and will involve a                   
              spatial integration of the 1-D PRZM results to the horizontal                  
              spatial dimensions, using the PC-based GWT-Platform.  This is a                
              prototype integrated groundwater simulation environment, written               
              for the MS Windows-3.  It manages the collection and use of all                
              geographic, physical, and chemical information of the                          
              application, which is entered in graphical mode on the screen.                 
              Relational data bases are formed and, automatically used for                   
              actual simulation, monitored on the screen in real time, with                  
              quasi-instantaneous graphical output.
