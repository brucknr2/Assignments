Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Self-incompatible Petunia inflata and a self-compatible cultivar of            
              Petunia hybrida will be used as model systems in an ongoing study              
              of the molecular, biochemical, and genetic bases of gametophytic               
              self-incompatibility. The first objective is to provide direct                 
              evidence for the role of the S-gene (the gene encoding the pistil              
              S-protein) in the recognition and rejection of self pollen. Two                
              approaches will be taken: a) transgenic P. inflata plants obtained             
              by introducing S1-gene into S3S3 genotype, and S3-gene into S1S1               
              genotype, will be tested to see whether the ability to reject                  
              pollen bearing S1-allele and S3-allele respectively has been                   
              conferred by the transgenes; b) antisense S1-gene will be                      
              introduced into P. inflata plants with S1S3 genotype to see whether            
              the ability to reject S1-bearing pollen is annulled in the                     
              transgenic plants. The second objective is to determine the                    
              regulatory sequences for the pistil-specific expression of the S-              
              gene and rnx2 gene (encoding RNase X2) by examining the expression             
              of a series of promoter-GUS constructs via transient assays and in             
              stable transformants. The third objective is to identify and                   
              characterize other components that participate in self-                        
              incompatibility interactions. PCR techniques will be used to                   
              investigate whether the S-gene is expressed in pollen during its               
              growth in situ. Chromosome walking experiments will be used to                 
              identify sequences linked to the S-gene that might encode other                
              components of the self-incompatibility system. An approach based on            
              immunoprecipitation will be used to examine whether pollinated                 
              pistils contain any proteins that interact with S-proteins. These              
              experiments may lead to identification of the long sought pollen               
              component of the S-locus. The fourth and final objective is to                 
              determine the genetic basis for the breakdown of self-                         
              incompatibility in the self-compatible cultivar of P. hybrida.                 
              Genetic crosses have been designed to test a model implicating a               
              modifier locus in the modulation of S-alleles activity in self-                
              incompatibility interactions.
