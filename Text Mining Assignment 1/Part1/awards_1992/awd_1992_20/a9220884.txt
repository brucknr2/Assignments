Abstract    :
                   The research investigates the specific aspects of algal food              
              quality that affect feeding and fecundity of herbivores.  While the            
              physiological condition of the algae is a critical factor                      
              influencing ingestion rates and reproduction, biochemical                      
              components of the algae are frequently not characterized or                    
              controlled.  To test the hypothesis that the major cellular                    
              constituents of algae vary with different limiting resources (N,               
              P, Si, light), the PIs will assess patterns of biochemical                     
              components over a range of growth rates in three species of algae              
              grown in continuous cultures, under various resource limitations.              
              To test whether algal biochemical composition affects the feeding              
              and reproductive rates of herbivores, the PIs will measure                     
              fecundity of Daphnia pulicaria with the various diets.  To assess              
              if seasonal variation in lipid production reflects changes in the              
              quality of phytoplankton, the PIs will monitor seasonal                        
              fluctuations of lipids in algae and zooplankton in three lakes                 
              across a trophic gradient.  Food quality in aquatic ecosystems is              
              highly dynamic.  The aim is to identify the general patterns of                
              accommodation of algae and herbivores to the variable resource                 
              base.
