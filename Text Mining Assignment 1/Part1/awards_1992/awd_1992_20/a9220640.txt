Abstract    :
                    The Metazoa includes all of the diverse groups of animals on             
              Earth.  An understanding of the manner in which these groups have              
              diversified in form and habitat is hampered by the lack of                     
              information concerning their precise relationships.  The sequence              
              of bases in the mitochondrial DNA molecule and the arrangements of             
              the genes encoded by it will be determined for a representative of             
              each major group included in this study.  These data will be                   
              combined with published sequence data for the mitochondrial DNAs of            
              members of other groups, and then analyzed with the goal of                    
              achieving a better understanding of the genetic relationships among            
              the various groups of animals.  The use of data from, two different            
              molecular levels (DNA base sequence and gene arrangement), provides            
              an internal check for consistency and is appropriate and necessary             
              when studying such dissimilar and distantly related groups.  The               
              results of this study will form the basis for the first clear                  
              analysis of trends in the form, diversity, and ecology of the                  
              Metazoa.
