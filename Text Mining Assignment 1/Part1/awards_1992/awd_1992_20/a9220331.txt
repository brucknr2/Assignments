Abstract    :
              This is a unit of DOE/NSF/USDA Collaborative Research in Plant                 
              Biology Program.                                                               
                                                                                             
              The research training group focuses its research theme on the                  
              mechanisms of signal transduction in plants.  The group will use               
              Arabidopsis thaliana as an experimental model system.  Students and            
              postdocs in this group will obtain in-depth training in five                   
              diverse disciplines: electrophysiology, genetics, biochemistry,                
              cell biology and structural biology.  Twelve faculty members will              
              participate in collaborative research with a common objective of               
              filling the large gap in our knowledge on the molecular mechanisms             
              that underlie hormone action and other signal transduction                     
              phenomena in higher plants.  The training plan is designed to allow            
              a more integrated approach towards preparing students for career in            
              research in plant biology.  Undergraduate participation is also a              
              part of the project.
