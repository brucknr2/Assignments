Abstract    :

              Magnetic Field Detector                                                        
                                                                                             
              This award will provide supplementary support to enable Dr. Mark               
              Jeffery of Drexel University to conduct collaborative research                 
              with Dr. Eiichi Goto for 24 months at the Institute of Physical                
              and Chemical Research in Japan.  They will utilize Dr. Jeffery's               
              numerical simulation of a new type of magnetic field measurement               
              device in order to demonstrate any flaws in the detector's                     
              design.                                                                        
                                                                                             
              Present Superconducting Quantum Interference Device (SQUID)                    
              technology can accurately measure changes in magnetic fields,                  
              however, in many applications the absolute magnitude of the                    
              magnetic field must also be measured.  Dr. Goto has patented a                 
              prototype magnetometer (IKA) which could measure the absolute                  
              magnitude of magnetic fields.  Before the IKA can be constructed,              
              a detailed numerical simulation of the device is needed to                     
              illustrate any problems associated with parameters such as the                 
              nonlinear properties of the Josephson junctions, temperature                   
              dependent quantum fluctuations, and noise due to inductive                     
              coupling between components.  Dr. Jeffery's experience in                      
              superconducting network theory and numerical modeling will                     
              complement Dr. Goto's expertise in superconducting device                      
              technology and will facilitate the design and effective                        
              construction of the IKA magnetic field detection device.
