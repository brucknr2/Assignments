Abstract    :
                   When computer scientists think of Computer Programming in                 
              mathematical terms, their thoughts are usually dominated by logic              
              and the tools (Recursive Functions, Complexity, Combinatorics,                 
              ...) inherited from mathematical logic.                                        
                   P I plans to work with Sussman at the AI Lab of MIT in 1992-              
              93, to try to propagate the ideas out into the computer science                
              and mathematics community.                                                     
                   The P I has some interesting ideas involving what might be                
              called "technology transfer of mathematics."  He will work on a                
              computational approach to this activity.
