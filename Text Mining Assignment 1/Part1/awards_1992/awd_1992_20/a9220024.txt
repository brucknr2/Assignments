Abstract    :
              The goal of this project is a determination of the three-                      
              dimensional structure of the hydroxylase component of the enzyme               
              methane monooxygenase (MMO, EC 1.14.13.25).  MMO catalyzes the                 
              conversion of methane into methanol.  High quality crystals of                 
              MMO hydroxylase which diffract to 2 A resolution have been                     
              obtained.  The crystal structure will be solved using multiple                 
              isomorphous replacement techniques.  The resulting model will be               
              refined used XPLOR and PROFFT to maximize the agreement with the               
              observed diffraction data.  The refined structure will be                      
              analyzed in light of continuing spectroscopic and kinetic                      
              analyses by our collaborator, Dr. John Lipscomb, to provide a                  
              framework for understanding how this enzyme functions.                         
              %%%                                                                            
              Dr. Ohlendorf proposes to determine the structure of the                       
              catalytic portion of methane monoxygnease (MMO) to understand to               
              better understand how it works.  There are several reasons why                 
              this enzyme is being studied.  One is that MMO plays a key                     
              ecological role in recapturing of billions of tons of the                      
              greenhouse gas, methane, into biomass.  If this enzyme suddenly                
              disappeared from the face of the earth, all that methane would be              
              released into the atmosphere.  Second, the reaction catalyzed by               
              MMO is important in the production of clean burning fuels.  An                 
              understanding of how MMO functions could assist in the design of               
              improved catalysts for this process.  Third, MMO produces an                   
              extremely reactive species that is capable of inserting an oxygen              
              into virtually any C-H bond.  The ability to control and modulate              
              this activity has tremendous potential in developing new                       
              processes for the synthesis and breakdown of difficult molecules.
