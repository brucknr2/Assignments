Abstract    :
              This award is for support of a one year program to perfect a method            
              for measuring the vertical strain rate at depth in glaciers and ice            
              sheets.  The motivation is to produce a sensitive and accurate                 
              method for measuring the vertical strain rate, as part of the ice              
              dynamics studies for the West Antarctic ice sheet program and the              
              eventual deep ice core drilling to take place in West Antarctica.              
              Vertical strain rate is important because it is closely related to             
              vertical velocity, and the age-depth relationship of the ice.  The             
              age-depth relationship of the ice must be known for proper under-              
              standing and interpretation of the results obtained from ice cores.
