Abstract    :
              This Symposium entitled, Mind Matters, held at Carnegie Mellon                 
              University on October 25-27, 1992 features unpublished papers of a             
              technical nature describing original research in the areas of                  
              computer science and cognition.  It is held in honor of Allen                  
              Newell, who has made seminal contributions to computer science and             
              cognitive science . He is generally regarded as one of the founding            
              fathers of the field of artificial intelligence. Dr. Newells                  
              research for the past decade has focussed on the development of                
              SOAR, as both an integrated architecture for building intelligent              
              systems and as a unified theory of cognition.  Soar is the unifying            
              thread for this symposium. A member of the Soar community follows              
              each invited speakers talk, discussing the implications of the                
              results just presented for the Soar architecture.  The speakers,               
              leading scholars in computer science and cognitive research, and               
              their topics are chosen to reflect the diversity of Professor                  
              Newells interests. The proceedings of the symposium are to be                 
              published as a book by Lawrence Erlbaum Publishers, as part of                 
              their Carnegie Symposium on Cognition series.
