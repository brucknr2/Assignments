Abstract    :
              The Biotron, constructed by the National Science Foundation                    
              at the University of Wisconsin, is a premier research                          
              facility in the United States, providing precise and unique                    
              environmental control capabilities for plant and animal                        
              research.  Use of the Biotron for plant research is                            
              significantly hampered, however, by the insufficient light                     
              intensities provided by the current lighting system.  We                       
              propose to install electrodeless microwave lamps in one room                   
              of the Biotron to have the potential of effectively                            
              simulating the sunlight spectrum and providing in excess of                    
              1000 mol m-2 s-1 of photosynthetic photon flux.  These new                     
              lamps will be evaluated for their potential to provide these                   
              photon flux levels without excessive heating along with                        
              study of reflector design for effective uniformity, lamp                       
              degradation over time, and capability for dimming to                           
              carefully lower and raise photon flux levels.  We will                         
              develop documentation to provide information for utilization                   
              of these lamps in other facilities needing high                                
              photosynthetic photon levels.
