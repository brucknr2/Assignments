Abstract    :
                   Professor Dehmelt proposes to continue his studies of single              
              elementary particles at rest in free space.  The main thrusts of               
              this Nobel Prize winning work are (1) Investigate the possibility              
              that electrons and positrons have internal structure, (2) Test                 
              the theory of Quantum Electrodynamics to the limits of the                     
              physically measurable, (3) Test electron-positron mirror symmetry              
              and the hypothesis that the combination of charge, parity, and                 
              time is a conserved quantity in nature.
