Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Whereas most invertebrates (animals that lack backbones) live for              
              just a few weeks, ticks typically live for several years. Moreover,            
              one particular group of ticks, the Ornithodoros ticks, can survive             
              for several years without feeding. The proposed research will                  
              elucidate the behavioral and physiological means by which these                
              ticks survive long periods of starvation.                                      
                                                                                             
              Ornithodoros ticks are the preeminent transmitters of relapsing                
              fever to human and livestock. They are also the only biological                
              transmitters of the African swine fever, a highly contagious                   
              disease against which drugs and vaccine are presently not                      
              available. The ability of the Ornithodoros ticks to harbor and                 
              transmit disease agents is enhanced by the fact that they feed on              
              a variety of birds, mammals and reptiles. No less significant are              
              their longevity and their ability to survive long periods of                   
              starvation. Because these ticks can live for as long as fifteen                
              years without feeding, they are superb reservoirs of many                      
              bacterial, protozoan and viral diseases even in the absence of                 
              suitable hosts. A better understanding of the mechanisms for this              
              spectacular capability of a physiologically and ecologically                   
              rational strategy for their control.
