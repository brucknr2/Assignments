Abstract    :
              The objective of this proposal is to acquire a high quality,                   
              automatic FPLC system and a new gamma counter, to purify and                   
              track proteins/peptides (particularly radioactive                              
              proteins/peptides) and their metals or prosthetic groups.                      
              The FPLC system is needed because the laboratories of the                      
              primary investigators currently have only very limited                         
              access to such systems, although in each, purification of                      
              proteins/peptides (for determination of their structure,                       
              function and regulation) is a major activity.  A new gamma                     
              counter is needed because the existing one is twelve years                     
              old and threatening to become unreliable.  If it should                        
              fail, this would greatly limit the research of the primary                     
              investigators, who are utterly dependent upon it for tracing                   
              copper and iron in biological systems; tracking copper and                     
              iron binding proteins and their receptors during their                         
              purification and/or in studies of their binding capacities,                    
              kinetics and functions; identifying the  binding sites of                      
              substrates and cofactors of specific enzymes via affinity                      
              labeling.  The isotopes used (67Cu,64Cu,59Fe, 125I) are all                    
              gamma emitters, and double labeling is often required.
