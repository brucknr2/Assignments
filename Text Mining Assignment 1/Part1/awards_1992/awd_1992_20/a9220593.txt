Abstract    :
                   Plants' responses to changes in their environments may be                 
              crucial for survival and reproduction, particularly under                      
              stressful conditions.  The term 'reaction norm' refers to the                  
              responses of an organism (actual and potential) to environmental               
              variation.  The nature of these responses to the environment is                
              under genetic control, and there are several ways that control                 
              can be manifested.  The form of the genetic control is important               
              because it will determine whether selection, either in the wild                
              or in agriculture, can alter the ways that plants respond to                   
              changes in environmental factors such as light, water, nutrients               
              or herbivores.                                                                 
                   The experiments being undertaken will reveal the genetic                  
              components of response to a gradient in soil nutrients, using a                
              model plant system, Arabidopsis thaliana.  In addition, we will                
              impose a regime of artificial selection on Arabidopsis                         
              populations to determine the ability of these plants to alter                  
              their reaction norms, that is, to change their abilities to                    
              respond to changes in the level of nutrients.  The results of                  
              these two sets of experiments will provide a better understanding              
              of the genetic determination of reaction norms, and of how                     
              selection may operate to change reaction norms.  Such an                       
              understanding may become increasingly important as we try to                   
              evaluate the impact of global environmental change on both wild                
              and agricultural plant species.
