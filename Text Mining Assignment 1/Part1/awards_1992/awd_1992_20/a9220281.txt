              An international conference, Global Scientific and

              Italy. A group of U.S. academic participants serve as                          
              rapporteurs for the Conference, and convene to prepare a                       
              special analysis of Conference materials and discussions                       
              for NSF. This report is intended to contribute to an                           
              informatiion and data base for planning NSF                                    
              international activities.                                                      
                                                                                             
              As one issue,the special analysis will  consider how                           
              mulilateral organizations facilitate S&T cooperation                           
              among institutions of member countries and with non-                           
              member countries. Other international issues will be                           
              addressed concerning S&T relations between industrial                          
              and develping countries. The special analysis will serve                       
              as highly useful input to NSF and INT in planning                              
              international initiatives.  ***
