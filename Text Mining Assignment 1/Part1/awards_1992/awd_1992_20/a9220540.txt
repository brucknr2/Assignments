Abstract    :
                   This research is being conducted by Dr. Olivier Rieppel, a                
              vertebrate paleontologist from the Chicago Field Museum of Natural             
              History.  Dr. Rieppel is examining the Sauropterygia, an extinct               
              group of diapsid reptiles.  The research focuses on variation in a             
              host of anatomical features, with a primary emphasis on                        
              understanding the relationships among sauropterygian groups.  The              
              derivation of these relationships are essential to understanding               
              diversification in more modern diapsids.  Another important aspect             
              of this research is that changes in the limbs of aquatic reptiles              
              can be used as a model for studying patterns of developmental                  
              rates, especially as they relate to changes in the vertebrate                  
              skeleton.  The relationships derived from this study will provide              
              the necessary interpretive framework for assessing these                       
              developmental processes.
