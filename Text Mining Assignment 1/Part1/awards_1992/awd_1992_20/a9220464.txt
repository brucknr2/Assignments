Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              When solutes and water are transported across epithelial tissues               
              such as the intestine, they may take one of two pathways: through              
              cells and/or between cells. To this date transport through cells               
              has been studied in enormous detail. Our good understanding of                 
              transcellular transport and its regulation has helped us                       
              appreciate the mechanisms of animal adaptation to fresh- and                   
              saltwater, it has led to  the discovery of the molecular defect                
              in cystic fibrosis, and it has aided the development of new drugs              
              (diuretics). The mechanisms of transport between cells are just                
              now beginning to receive attention. A major advance in this                    
              direction was made during the previous NSF award period in the                 
              laboratory of the PI: the first demonstration that an                          
              extracellular peptide (leucoknin, a neurohormone) regulates a                  
              transport pathway outside the cell. Whether this pathway is                    
              between cells, the so-called paracellular pathway, is the first                
              and most important objective of the continuation of this work.                 
              The second objective is the detailed examination of the ion pump               
              located in the cell membrane facing the urine side of the kidney.              
              The third objective is to discover new hormones involved in the                
              regulation of transport. This work is done in isolated kidneys of              
              insects, the so-called Malpighian tubules of the yellow fever                  
              mosquito.
