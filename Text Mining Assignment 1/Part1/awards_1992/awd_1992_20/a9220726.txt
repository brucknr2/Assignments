Abstract    :
                   This grant in mathematical physics will use the                           
              "consistent-history" approach to resolve some longstanding                     
              problems relating to the properties of a quantum mechanical                    
              system.  First, the approach will be applied to the relation                   
              of quantum mechanics to the statistical irreversibility                        
              embodied in the second law of thermodynamics.  Then it will be                 
              used to illuminate a collection of paradoxes in which quantum                  
              mechanics predicts violations of either Bell's inequality or                   
              common-sense notions of reality, locality and the like.  A                     
              study of the consistency of various quantum mechanical                         
              histories will indicate where the sources of various                           
              conceptual problems are.
