Abstract    :
                Tectonic studies of the eastern United States have                           
              revealed that the region has formed due the collision of                       
              large crustal scale fragments in Paleozoic time.  An                           
              essential aspect to understanding this global process is the                   
              determination of the time of collision and the conditions                      
              under which such an amalgamation took place.  The Bronson                      
              Hill Anticlinorium of western New Hampshire is thought to                      
              represent one these crustal-scale fragments.  Coupling field                   
              studies with laboratory analysis, this project will                            
              determine the pressure-temperature time history of rocks of                    
              the Bronson Hill area.  Results will have important                            
              implications for the development of New England as well as                     
              establishing temperature and pressure constraints for                          
              continental collision processes.
