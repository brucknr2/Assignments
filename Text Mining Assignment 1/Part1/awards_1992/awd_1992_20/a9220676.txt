Abstract    :
                   Studies of the systematics and evolution of polyploid mosses              
              (those with duplicated sets of chromosomes) will be continued by               
              researchers at the University of Georgia, making use of protein                
              electrophoresis and other molecular techniques. Earlier work by the            
              group has discovered at least four cases of allopolyploidy in the              
              moss family Mniaceae (chromosome doubling following hybridization              
              between genetically different populations). This important mode of             
              speciation in other land plants had not been documented previously             
              in any bryophyte. Work will focus on five complementary projects:              
              1. New studies of haploid-polyploid species pairs in the moss                  
              genera Cinclidium, Plagiomnium section Plagiomnium, Plagiomnium                
              section Rostrata, and Mnium section Laevinervia; 2. Detailed                   
              studies of the taxonomic distribution of isozyme (gene)                        
              duplications to assess phylogenetic relationships within the                   
              family; 3. Comparisons of genetic variation in selected species                
              that show intercontinentally disjunct distributions; 4. Analyses               
              using DNA markers to clarify further the progenitors of certain                
              allopolyploids; and 5. Cladistic analyses of species-level                     
              phylogenies based on morphological and isozyme data. The research              
              will provide new insights into phylogenetic relationships in the               
              moss family Mniaceae, and will also provide taxonomic updating for             
              work toward the moss component of the Flora of North America                   
              enterprise.
