Abstract    :
              Formation of araB-lacZ hybrid coding sequences normally utilizes               
              the DNA rearrangement activities of transposable bacteriophage Mu.             
              Fusion events are physiologically specific: they do not occur                  
              during normal growth but are found at high rates following                     
              starvation.  This system is a prime example of inducible genetic               
              changes now called "directed mutation." We have developed a                    
              detailed molecular explanation of the complex series of biochemical            
              events that produce ara-lac fusions.  The cAMP-CRP catabolite                  
              sensory system and the CLP heat-shock protease play essential roles            
              in Mu activation during starvation.  PCR technology has been                   
              validated for the detection of rare fusion events, and there is                
              evidence for no-fusion rearrangements after stress.  Thus, the ara-            
              lac fusion system is one of the best-characterized physiologically             
              regulated mutational systems.  Genetic studies and molecular                   
              experiments are outlined here to define the roles of the cAMP-CRP              
              and CLP systems in Mu activation, to identify alternative                      
              biochemical pathways to fusion formation, and to clarify the nature            
              of Mu-dependent DNA rearrangements following stress.                           
              %%%                                                                            
              The results of this research will provide definitive answers to                
              several issues in the directed mutation controversy and identify               
              components of the signal transduction network connecting cellular              
              physiology and DNA biochemistry.
