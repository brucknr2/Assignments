                   This proposal provides funds for an evaluator to study the

              Institute of Mining and Technology's Industry/University                       
              Cooperative Research Center for Hazardous and Toxic Substances.                
              The three year study will collect data from the researchers,                   
              students and industry members; maintain a historical profile of the            
              Center; and serve in a liaison function between all participants in            
              the Center.
