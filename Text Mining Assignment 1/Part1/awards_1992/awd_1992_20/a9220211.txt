Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Some species of animals occur in two different morphologies, a                 
              phenomenon called polyphenism. Usually the different alternative               
              morphologies develop in different seasons of the year. In order to             
              develop a different morphology it is necessary to activate a                   
              different set of genes, and thus the problem of control of                     
              polyphenism is to discover the mechanism by which an animal                    
              "chooses" between two alternative gene sets. The aim of the                    
              proposed research is to develop, for the first time, an                        
              understanding of complete pathway of genetic control in such a                 
              seasonal polyphenism. For this research we will use the butterfly,             
              Precis coenia, which has a dramatic color polyphenism and for which            
              our preliminary studies have already elucidated portions of the                
              control pathway. The proposed research will identify the pigments              
              responsible for the different color forms and the enzymes                      
              responsible for their synthesis. The genes for these enzymes will              
              then be cloned so that we may develop tools to study the mechanism             
              by which their expression is controlled. We know that a steroid                
              hormone, 20-OH-ecdysone, is ultimately responsible for stimulating             
              the genetic switch that causes the alternative pigment synthesis to            
              occur, and experiments will be done to begin to investigate how                
              this could control the differential expression of enzymes for the              
              alternative pigments.
