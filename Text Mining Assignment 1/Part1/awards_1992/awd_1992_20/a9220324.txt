Abstract    :
                   This research involves the study of nested row and column                 
              designs.  The investigator will study optimal design using                     
              spatial correlation models rather than the classical model                     
              formulation.  The spatial processes to be employed will be                     
              members of the autonormal family, a two-dimensional                            
              generalization of the one-dimensional autoregressive processes.                
                   Experimental design has long been used in agriculture to                  
              improve crop production.  It is now being used in manufacturing                
              to improve product quality.  This research will study optimality               
              of certain types of designs.
