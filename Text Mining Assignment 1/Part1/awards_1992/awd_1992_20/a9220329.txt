Abstract    :
              This is a unit of DOE/NSF/USDA Collaborative Research in Plant                 
              Biology Program.                                                               
                                                                                             
              The research training group focuses its research theme on                      
              molecular evolution of plants.  The long-range goal of the                     
              program is to encourage greater interaction and cooperation among              
              faculty members in plant molecular genetics, population genetics,              
              systematics, plant anatomy, and evolutionary biology, and to                   
              develop plant biologists who have the capacity to conceive,                    
              design and implement research that integrates the concepts and                 
              techniques of multiple facets of plant molecular evolution. The                
              program involves faculty members, postdocs, graduate students and              
              undergraduate students.                                                        
                                                                                             
              The group will focus their research efforts on studies of: (1)                 
              genome evolution: the genetic architecture of plant genomes, (2)               
              genome genealogies within and among plant species, and (3)                     
              evolutionary interpretation of plant structure and genome                      
              organization.
