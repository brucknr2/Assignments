Abstract    :
                   This grant supports research by three New York University                 
              (NYU) faculty, a postdoctoral research associate and three                     
              graduate students.  The project is the study of collisions of                  
              antiprotons with protons at 2 TeV in the Tevatron collider at                  
              Fermilab.  The group are members of the D0 collaboration who                   
              have built and put into operation a large, complex apparatus                   
              that detects the interaction products and determines their                     
              properties.  Since its existence is a crucial component of the                 
              Standard Model paradigm, the D0 experiment has a major goal                    
              the discovery of the top quark and determination of some of                    
              its properties.  D0 is one of the two experiments that will                    
              continue to have that capability in the next few years.  Many                  
              different kinds of stringent tests of QCD and electroweak                      
              theoretical predictions also will result.  The NYU group's                     
              major current interest is the electroweak sector.  They are                    
              prepared to make a precise measurement of the W-boson mass                     
              with which to confront the theory.
