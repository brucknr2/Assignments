Abstract    :
                   Professor Hinds will continue his studies on time reversal                
              invariance by using a molecular beam of thallium fluoride (TIF)                
              and observing the nuclear spin resonance of this molecule.  He                 
              will also study the unusual physics of atoms confined to micron-               
              sized cavities.  Among the experiments planned is the first                    
              precise measurement of the Casimir force between an atom and a                 
              cavity.
