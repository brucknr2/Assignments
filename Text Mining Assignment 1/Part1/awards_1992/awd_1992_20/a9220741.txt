Abstract    :
              Professor John Dahler is supported by a grant from the                         
              Theoretical and Computational Chemistry Program to perform                     
              theoretical studies in five major areas: 1) theory of collodial                
              dispersions; 2) chemical reactions in small molecule fluids; 3)                
              polymer-related research; 4) transport and relaxation in                       
              fluids; and 5) topics in collision theory.  He will use formal                 
              theory supplemented by computer simulations to study transport,                
              relaxation and chemical reactions in model fluid systems                       
              including polymers.                                                            
              %%%                                                                            
              Since most chemical reactions occur in solvent media in the                    
              liquid state, it is of key importance to understand the                        
              influence the solvent exerts on the reactant solutes.  There                   
              are a number of molecular interactions which occur between the                 
              solute and the solvent, and many of them can be modeled using a                
              continuum rather than a discrete molecular model for the                       
              solvent.  Dahler's research focusses on theoretical models for                 
              transport of solute molecules, including polymers, in a viscous                
              continuum medium.
