Abstract    :
              This project deals with the organization of the Fifth Annual                   
              Workshop on Aerospace Computational Control. The major objectives              
              of this workshop are to provide NSF and NASA an assessment of                  
              current computational control research and development; to                     
              identify future needs in important research areas such as                      
              computer-aided control design and multibody simulation tools                   
              which can be built with the combined efforts of government,                    
              industrial and university personnel; and to strengthen the link                
              between tool developers and end-users. Another important goal of               
              the workshop is to strengthen cooperation between the industry                 
              and university researchers thereby aiding in the transfer of                   
              technology from the research level to the end-users. The issues                
              discussed at the workshop include multibody dynamics,                          
              computational techniques, model reduction, real-time simulation,               
              symbolic manipulation and concurrent processing.***       //
