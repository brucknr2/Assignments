Abstract    :
                    Many features of an animal, such as its skull shape, change              
              throughout its life.  Yet, comparative studies of skull shape,                 
              including those that seek to infer evolutionary relationships among            
              groups, and those that examine evolutionary changes in skull form,             
              commonly survey only adults.  The proposed research will analyze               
              developmental changes in skull form to determine whether these                 
              transformations provide information about evolutionary                         
              relationships among selected rodents, and to dissect evolutionary              
              changes in skull development.  Recent advances in  methods for                 
              quantifying shape change have yielded promising techniques that                
              will be applied in this analysis.  The method of thin-plate                    
              splines, the method that I propose to use, has a unique advantage              
              in that it gives a way to identify a series of independent shape               
              characters that have specific location and spatial extent on the               
              skull.  In the first stage of this project, I will compare three               
              genera of murid rodent Mus, Sigmodon and Peromyscus.  Relationships            
              among these genera are not controversial.  I will compare: 1)                  
              transformations in skull shape from age to age in each species; 2)             
              average skull shape at each age across species; and 3)                         
              intraspecific variability of skull shapes and their                            
              transformations.  This phase of the research will explore several              
              methodological issues, such as methods for coding developmental                
              transformations of shape characters.  The second stage of the                  
              research will use these methods to analyze relationships among                 
              Sigmodon species, and to describe evolutionary modifications of                
              skull growth.
