Abstract    :
              9220603  Cooper         Flexural creep and attenuation experiments on
              glass-ceramics  and synthetic (Co-Mg) olivine-basalt partial-melt aggregates 
              indicate three-to-four distinct anelastic loss (attenuation)  mechanisms. 
              These losses interact to produce an attenuation "band"  in space.  The nature
              of these losses, if understood, could        form an unequivocal foundation for
              recognizing the attenuation  effects(s) uniquely associated with partial
              melting.  Therefore,  an experimental investigation of the effects of
              quasiequilibrated  partial melting on the attenuation behavior of
              polycrystalline  silicates will be done.  Seismic-to-subseismic frequency 
              experiments will be performed in both shear (reciprocating torsion)  and
              Young's modulus (reciprocating flexure) formats in order to  isolate the
              effects of a steady-state melt morphology on S- and P-  wave attenuation.  The
              experiments will be applied to synthetic  aggregates of olivine,
              olivine-plus-(olivine-saturated) tholeiite  basalt and aluminosilicate
              glass-ceramics.  ***
