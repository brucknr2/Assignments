Abstract    :
                    Feather mites are obligate commensals on or in the feathers of           
              birds and are known to occur on every avian family except the                  
              penguins, totids, and ratites of South America and Australia.  The             
              more than 2,000 species (estimated to represent 10% of the total               
              fauna) are assigned to 379 named and approximately 64 new genera               
              arranged in 32 families and three superfamilies.  Among these taxa             
              there are many examples of convergent evolution of form, apparent              
              coevoloution of hosts and commensals, and specializations for                  
              different microhabitats on and in feathers.                                    
                    At the present time, it is still practically impossible for              
              non-specialists to make valid determinations even though there are             
              many papers on feather mites.  The reasons for this are simple -               
              there are no reliable keys to families, few inclusive keys to                  
              genera and species within families, and no guides to the vast                  
              literature.                                                                    
                    In collaboration chiefly with Dr. J. Gaud (Nice, France), the            
              leading authority of feather mites, we will rectify the lamentable             
              situation concerning identification.  We plan to produce an                    
              illustrated publication for the identification of the                          
              aforementioned supraspecific taxa.  The first step is to complete              
              illustrations of species to represent the 379 genera.  These should            
              be completed in one year.                                                      
                    The combined 75 years of experience of Dr. J. Gaud and the               
              principal investigator make us uniquely qualified to undertake this            
              major project.  When completed, the publication will open the field            
              of feather mite systematics where so much basic research is needed,            
              especially phylogenetic, biological and ontogenetic studies, and               
              host-commensal relationships.
