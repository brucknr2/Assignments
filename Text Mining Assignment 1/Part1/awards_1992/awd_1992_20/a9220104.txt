Abstract    :
                This research will support continued education/outreach programs             
              dealing with earthquakes in the Cape Mendocino, California, region.            
              The Mendocino triple junction near Cape Mendocino in northern                  
              California is the dynamic region where the Gorda, Pacific and North            
              American plates meet.  Historically, the Cape Mendocino region and             
              adjacent offshore areas have been one of the most seismically                  
              active areas of the western United States.  During the past three              
              years, six earthquakes of magnitude greater than 5.2 have occurred             
              in the vicinity of the triple junction, causing damage in                      
              neighboring communities.  This research is a component of the                  
              National Earthquake Hazard Reduction Program.
