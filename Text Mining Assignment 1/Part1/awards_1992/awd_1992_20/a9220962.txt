Abstract    :
              The biological consequences of increased ultraviolet (UV)                      
              radiation reaching the Earth's surface due to the Antarctic Ozone              
              Hole has recently been documented. Based on direct in situ                     
              measurements of ultraviolet radiation and primary productivity,                
              it was estimated that ozone-related damage to phytoplankton                    
              resulted in a minimum of six to twelve per cent reduction in                   
              primary productivity within the marginal ice zone of the Southern              
              Ocean. This project will further examine this topic by developing              
              a space and time climatology of incident and penetrating spectral              
              irradiance for the Southern Ocean. Also, the magnitude and                     
              kinetics of UV dependent production of organic carbon and UV                   
              photodamage will be determined. The data will be examined in the               
              context of a bio-optical model of primary productivity. Results                
              will contribute significantly to abilities to predict changes                  
              within phytoplankton communities experiencing enhanced UV                      
              radiation and provide an empirical basis for developing models                 
              attempting to assess the consequences for higher trophic levels                
              in the Antarctic food web.
