Abstract    :
              This project is a modeling study of the deep and bottom water                  
              formation process along the continental margin of the Western                  
              Weddell Sea.  It will be based on an existing three-dimensional                
              primitive equation model (the so-called Semi-spectral Primitive                
              Equation Model, or SPEM) proven successful in coastal circulation              
              studies.  Direct observations made during the occupation of Ice                
              Station Weddell in 1992 will be used to initialize, force, and                 
              diagnose the model results.  Modifications to the model will allow             
              the inclusion of changes in sea water density due to freezing and              
              melting of ice (surface buoyancy fluxes), sea ice dynamics, and                
              ocean /ice-shelf interactions.                                                 
                                                                                             
              Expected results from the study are the simulation of existing                 
              water mass characteristics, their spatial and temporal evolution,              
              and the regional circulation of the Weddell Sea.  It will also be              
              possible to evaluate the model itself with respect to the                      
              sensitivity of simulated results with respect to model parameters              
              and parameterization schemes, intensity of external forcing, and               
              variations in initial conditions. The results will test existing               
              theories of deep and bottom water formation for the southwestern               
              Weddell Sea.
