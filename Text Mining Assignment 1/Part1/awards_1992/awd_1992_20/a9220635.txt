Abstract    :
              This collaborative effort will make use of an extensive and unique             
              data set collected over several years from the Chukchi Sea.                    
              Investigators from three institutions will study the interactions              
              of physical, chemical, and biological processes of the Chukchi Sea             
              ecosystem to define its present and perhaps future trophic status              
              through a series of data and simulation analyses.  The physical                
              processes associated with biological and chemical processes in the             
              Chukchi Sea will be assessed using data from a series of 13 current            
              meter moorings in 1990-1991 and seven bilateral U.S.-U.S.S.R.                  
              cruises during 1988-1991.  Work will be undertaken to analyze the              
              buoyancy and current fields from the year-long time series data                
              together with the wind field; to examine the role of physical                  
              processes, with a particular emphasis on the variability of the                
              shelf circulation over the year, the role of the wind in forcing               
              the shelf circulation, and the variable fluxes of heat, salt, and              
              other dissolved substances through the system.  The source water               
              concentrations of nutrients will be combined with buoyancy flux                
              estimates to calculate nutrient flux estimates.  Nutrient budgets              
              for the Chukchi Sea shelf will then be constructed and compared to             
              subsurface oxygen inventories and primary production estimates.                
              The work supports the goals and research priorities of the Arctic              
              System Science (ARCSS) program of the Global Geosciences                       
              Initiative.
