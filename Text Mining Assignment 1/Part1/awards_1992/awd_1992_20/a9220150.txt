Abstract    :
              Decreased concentrations of ozone in the stratosphere over                     
              Antarctica have resulted in increased levels of ultraviolet                    
              radiation in the UV-B portion of the spectrum incident at the                  
              earth's surface beneath the 'ozone hole'. There is now world-wide              
              concern that this enhanced flux of UV radiation may cause serious              
              harm to the marine ecosystem in the Southern Ocean. This project,              
              which includes field and laboratory studies, will help to                      
              determine the effects of enhanced levels of UV-B radiation on                  
              phytoplankton, and to relate such effects to overlying ozone                   
              concentrations. UV levels determined from the NSF-Operated UV-                 
              Spectroradiometer at Palmer Station will be directly applicable                
              to the interpretation of observed biological effects. Primary                  
              attention will be given to the effects of UV-B radiation on                    
              photosynthetic rates, on damage to DNA with resulting loss of                  
              cell viability, and on the rates and extent to which                           
              phytoplankton can minimize cellular UV damage by production of                 
              specialized protective pigments. Differential sensitivity to UV-B              
              of dominant phytoplankton species or groups will also be                       
              determined, as such differences might have important consequences              
              on the structure of the food web in antarctic waters. As the                   
              project's activity will cover the period from September through                
              December, the resulting data set should encompass the period of                
              maximal development of the ozone hole, as well as the time of the              
              summer solstice. This project is important because it will                     
              elaborate previous findings and address in detail the extent and               
              the nature of ultraviolet damage to phytoplankton, as well as                  
              evaluate the kinds of defenses cells can muster against it.
