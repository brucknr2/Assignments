Abstract    :
              The objectives of this research are to understand the structures               
              and properties of muonium defect centers in semiconductors.  In                
              turn this will provide a complementary picture of hydrogen in                  
              semiconductors, a common impurity which is difficult to study in               
              unreacted form.  The study of muonium permits us to learn about a              
              variety of deep-level defect properties, such as metastability and             
              bistability, local and long-range tunneling, carrier trapping, and             
              pairing reactions.  These topics are of considerable scientific and            
              technological interest but are poorly understood.  The powerful                
              methods of muon spectroscopy together with the frequent occurrence             
              of muonium centers makes this a powerful approach to these                     
              problems.                                                                      
              %%%                                                                            
              The research uses a sophisticated technique (involving a short-                
              lived sub-atomic particle and its interactions with its                        
              surroundings) to probe the properties of defects in semiconductors.            
              These defects are important determinants of the semiconductor                  
              properties and affect performance such as solar-cell efficiency.               
              These topics are of considerable scientific and technological                  
              interest but are poorly understood.
