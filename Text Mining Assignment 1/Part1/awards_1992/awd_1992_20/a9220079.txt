Abstract    :
                   The Paleocene was an important interval in the                            
              evolution of modern families of angiosperms and in the rapid                   
              spread of deciduous dicotyledons in the Northern Hemisphere                    
              following the terminal Cretaceous event.  This study will                      
              improve the systematic and stratigraphic resolution of key                     
              genera shared between the Paleocene of mid-latitude Asia and                   
              western North America.  In cooperation with the Nanjing                        
              Institute of Geology and Paleontology, selected  Paleocene                     
              floras in northwestern and northeastern China will be                          
              described with particular attention to leaf and pollen taxa                    
              that are shared with the Paleocene of North America.                           
              Stratigraphic sections in Wyoming that have already provided                   
              useful palynostratigraphic sequences will be recollected for                   
              leaves, fruits and flowers in order to link megafossils with                   
              the palynological zonation.  Special attention will be given                   
              to families of the Hamamelidae that were undergoing                            
              evolutionary radiations through the Paleocene, including                       
              Juglandacea, Betulaceae, Ulmacea, and Platanaceae.  In                         
              addition, attempts will be made to calibrate palynological                     
              and megafloral zones with land mammal stages and/or                            
              radiometrically dated units.
