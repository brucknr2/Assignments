Abstract    :
              The objective of the Third International Conference on Case                    
              Histories in Geotechnical Engineering is to bring the engineers,               
              scientists, and academic personnel from around the world together              
              to discuss case histories of geotechnical structures relative to               
              satisfactory performance and failure or unsatisfactory                         
              performance. The need for this conference has been established by              
              discussions and correspondence with a large number of                          
              professionals and societies around the world.
