Abstract    :
              This project, in the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program of                
              the Chemistry Division, is in the field of low temperature ion                 
              chemistry.  Prof. M. Smith of the University of Arizona, will                  
              study the binary chemistry of ion-molecule reactions and the                   
              relaxation and energy transfer at ultra low temperatures                       
              produced in a supersonic jet expansion of the reactant gases.                  
              He will also conduct photoelectron spectroscopy for state                      
              selection of molecular ions and cluster initiated                              
              state-selected chemical reactions.  Using Laval nozzle                         
              expansions of the component gases the experiments will be                      
              extended to temperatures above those obtained with free jet                    
              expansions but below those accessible with conventional                        
              techniques.

              The chemistry of ion-molecule has been studied in many                         
              laboratories yet there are very few investigations in the                      
              regime of very low temperatures.  Prof. Smith's research in                    
              this field has had notable successes and he is one of its very                 
              few practitioners.  The results of this research will be                       
              important to astronomers modeling interstellar chemistry.
