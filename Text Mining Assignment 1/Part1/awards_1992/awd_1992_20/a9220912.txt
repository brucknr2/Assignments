Abstract    :
              Plants respond to inoculation with pathogens with a range of                   
              defense-associated responses, which can include the accumulation of            
              anti-microbial, low molecular weight compounds, termed                         
              phytoalexins.  The significance of any one defense-associated                  
              response in disease resistance is unknown in most host/pathogen                
              systems.  Arabidopsis thaliana accumulates the toxic metabolite 3-             
              thiazol-2'-yl-indole after inoculation with the bacterial pathogen             
              Pseudomonas syringae pv. syringae.  This compound, which has been              
              given the trivial name camalexin, fits the classic definition of a             
              phytoalexin.  To determine the camalexin biosynthetic pathway and              
              to address the role of camalexin in disease resistance, mutants                
              unable to accumulate camalexin will be isolated.  Arabidopsis is               
              ideally suited for the isolation and genetic characterization of               
              mutants.  Both feeding studies with radiolabeled precursors and                
              analyses of camalexin-deficient mutants will help construct a                  
              biosynthetic pathway for this secondary metabolite.  To evaluate               
              the role of camalexin in limiting pathogen growth in vivo disease              
              development in one well-defined camalexin mutant will be compared              
              to that occurring in wild-type plants.  With these results, it will            
              be possible to formulate a broad statement about the relative role             
              of phytoalexins in resistance to both fungal and bacterial diseases            
              of cruciferous plants.
