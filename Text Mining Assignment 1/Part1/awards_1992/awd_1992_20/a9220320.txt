Abstract    :
              The principal goals of this project are:  1) to determine the                  
              various 3-dimensional structures adopted by chromosomes at                     
              different points in the cell cycle; 2) to work out the physico                 
              chemical basis underlying their stability; and 3) to show how                  
              these satisfy the functional requirements of cell division,                    
              recombination, gene expression and replication.

              Dr. Widom has developed a new kind of X-ray "area" detector which              
              show significantly improved resolution.  This will be used to                  
              obtain diffraction patterns from semi-oriented samples of                      
              chromosomes in various stages of folding, from which structural                
              information may be deduced.  He will also use yeast genetics to                
              identify proteins (and their genes) that are necessary for the                 
              final stages of chromosomal folding, for cell division and                     
              recombination.
