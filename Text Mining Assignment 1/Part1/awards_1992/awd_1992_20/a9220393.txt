Abstract    :
              In this research project, supported in the Analytical and                      
              Surface Chemistry Program, detailed studies of the interaction                 
              of polyatomic ions with well characterized solid surfaces will                 
              be undertaken.  An understanding of the molecular ion-surface                  
              collision event is important in the development of surface                     
              induced dissociation as a method for the mass spectrometric                    
              analysis of the structure of large molecules.  The goal of the                 
              present work is to identify and quantify the various events                    
              which may occur when a molecular ion strikes a clean or                        
              adsorbate covered surface, including fragmentation, sticking,                  
              reaction, implantation, sputtering, and ion neutralization.

              The structural analysis of large and complex molecules is often                
              carried out using mass spectrometric methods.  One of the most                 
              promising of these methods is the use of surface induced                       
              dissociation to enable structural analysis.  This research                     
              project addresses the details of the molecule-surface collision                
              which controls surface induced dissociation.  A more complete                  
              understanding of this event will enable the widespread                         
              application of the surface induced dissociation approach to the                
              analysis of complex, biologically relevant molecules.
