Abstract    :
              This is a conference that draws together researchers from both                 
              universities and industry across a wide range of disciplines.  The             
              emphasis of the conference is the design of systems taking into                
              account chip design, packaging, and interconnection issues.  By                
              holding one session track instead of parallel sessions, the                    
              organizers emphasize the importance of a firm grasp of all of these            
              issues for the modern system designer.
