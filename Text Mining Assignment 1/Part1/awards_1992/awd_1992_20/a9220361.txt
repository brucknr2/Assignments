Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The effectiveness of most protein hormones is monitored in part                
              by the number of cell surface receptors for these hormones. By                 
              internalizing the number of cell surface receptors after binding               
              hormone (down regulation), a cell can regulate its sensitivity to              
              that messenger. The insulin- insulin receptor complex is one                   
              system that responds in this fashion. Any deviations in this self-             
              monitoring mechanism can have profound effects on the ability of               
              the cell to respond to these hormones, and this in turn can have               
              great impact on cell function. The goal of this proposal is to                 
              determine the roles that particular molecules, notably membrane                
              lipids, cytoskeletal proteins and phosphorylated membrane                      
              proteins have on this process. The cell system used is the human               
              erythrocyte. In the lipid studies, the lipid content or fluidity               
              will be altered, and the effects on down regulation studied. In                
              the cytoskeletal work, chemical and antibody-induced changes, and              
              pathologically -altered cytoskeletons will be studied. Chemicals               
              know to alter protein phosphorylation will be used to determine                
              the impact of this protein modification on down regulation. These              
              studies should lead to a clearer understanding of the role of                  
              these components in this process.
