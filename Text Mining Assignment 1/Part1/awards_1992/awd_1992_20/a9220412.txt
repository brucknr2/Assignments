Abstract    :
                   International Ornithological Congresses have been held at                 
              regular intervals since 1884.  The XXIst IOC will be held in                   
              Vienna, Austria, in August, 1994.  It will be the first congress               
              to be held since the fall of the Iron Curtain, and it thus provides            
              the first major opportunity since the end of World War II for                  
              extensive participation by scientists from both eastern and western            
              bloc countries.  Many cooperative, international projects are                  
              expected to be initiated at the congress, where the expected                   
              attendance may exceed 2,000 scientists and students.  Participation            
              by U.S. scientists in symposia, workshops, and so forth will be                
              extensive.  Symposia fall into five general thematic areas:                    
              systematics, evolution, and biogeography of birds; physiology and              
              nutritional biology; behavior, migration, and orientation; ecology,            
              reproduction, and population structure; and conservation.  Funds               
              from NSF are matched by funds from the American Ornithologists'                
              Union for travel grants.
