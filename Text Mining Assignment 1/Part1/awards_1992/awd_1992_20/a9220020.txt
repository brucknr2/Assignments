Abstract    :
              Recent advances in high precision mass spectrometry have                       
              made it possible to study the early history of the Earth (4-                   
              4.6 Ga ago) using the decay signature of the extinct nuclide                   
              146Sm.  146Sm was present at the beginning of solar system                     
              history with an abundance of only 0.25% of Sm.  Observable                     
              variations in the abundance of its daughter nuclide 142Nd                      
              record differentiation processes active only during the                        
              first 300 Ma of Earth history. By linking the short-lived                      
              146Sm-142Nd and long-lived 147Sm-143Nd chronometers into a                     
              "coupled" systematics, it is possible to precisely constrain                   
              the formation history of the Earth's primordial protocrust.                    
              The Hadean epoch (4.0-4.6 Ga) is the least well-known period                   
              in Earth history.  This project will map out a basic                           
              chronological outline of global geochemical differentiation.
