Abstract    :
              9220855  Varaiya  The electric power industry is being significantly
              restructured  in order to improve performance by reducing capital expenditures 
              through better equipment utilization, by reducing fuel cost  through better
              inter-firm coordination, and by offering  differentiated services that better
              match customer needs.  The  realization of these performance gains will require
              a vastly  expanded capability to monitor and control the entire power  network.
               It is proposed to design and implement a laboratory-  scale Distribution 
              Network Management System (DNMS).  Logically,  the DNMS will be organized into
              three layers:the communication  facility which permits management stations to
              exchange monitoring  and control information will remote physical elements such
              as  distribution capacitors and customer meters; the application  facility
              which permits implementation of algorithms for  particular functions such as
              adjusting capacitors to minimize  losses; and the interpretation facility which
              hides from the  other facilities the heterogeneity of the physical elements. 
              The  DNMS system will be designed and tested on simulators of the bulk  power
              and distribution systems.  The research will build a recent  work on
              distribution automation and power utility communication  architecture, and on
              recent work on telecommunications network  management.  ***
