Abstract    :
                   Using simulated as well as real datasets we shall examine                 
              methodological and theoretical aspects of spatial models relevant              
              to numerous topics in population biology.  Our approach focuses on             
              examination of gene-frequency surfaces, spatial autoocorrelation               
              analysis, and generalizations of the Mantel test.  We shall examine            
              four separate topics. 1) Population biological inferences from                 
              gene-frequency and other surfaces.  2)  Theoretical investigations             
              of distributions of measures of spatial autocurrelation under null             
              hypotheses of population biological interest.  3)  Boundary                    
              detection and significance testing of detected boundaries.  4)                 
              Testing of biological distance matrices against design matrices                
              representing specific alternative hypotheses.  Under each of these             
              topics several individual research problems are planned.  The                  
              results of these endeavors will greatly facilitate inferences from             
              patterns to process in a wide variety of problems in population                
              biology.//
