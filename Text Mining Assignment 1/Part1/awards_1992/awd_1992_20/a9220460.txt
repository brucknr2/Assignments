Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The Principal Investigator on this research grant will be                      
              continuing a galaxy redshift survey which will be used to study                
              the large-scale structure distribution of galaxies.  He is making              
              use of spectrograph that was specifically developed for this                   
              project.  This spectrograph is able to record the spectra of 112               
              objects at one time.  About 12,000 galaxies have been measured to              
              date, and the purpose of this award is to continue this survey                 
              for another three-year period.                                                 
                                                                                             
              The Principal Investigator is recognized throughout the world for              
              his capabilities in this research area.
