Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The hormone insulin binds to its specific receptor at the plasma               
              membrane of the cell. This binding initiates two processes. In the             
              first, the receptor itself is chemically modified by the addition              
              of phosphate functions to signal the cell to the presence of                   
              insulin. The cell then modifies its metabolism in response to this             
              signal. In the second process, insulin binding causes the insulin-             
              receptor complex to be taken into the cell itself. In the past,                
              these two processes have been studied as independent, unrelated                
              events. However, preliminary data indicate that these two processes            
              are inter-dependent, related events. The receptor acquires more                
              phosphate as it moves from the plasma membrane into the cell. In               
              addition, the highly phosphorylated receptor also is a better                  
              signal-mediator than the less phosphorylated receptor at the plasma            
              membrane. The goals of this project are to understand  how these               
              phosphate groups are added to and removed from the insulin                     
              receptor, and if, in the intact cell, the highly phosphorylated                
              internal receptor is involved in the generation of the insulin                 
              signal.
