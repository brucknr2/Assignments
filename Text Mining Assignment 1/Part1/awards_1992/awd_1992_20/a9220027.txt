Abstract    :
              The principal objective of this research project is to                         
              obtain precise determinations of the chemical equilibria                       
              that govern the observed mineral assemblages in pelitic                        
              metamorphic rocks.  Behavior of the minerals cordierite,                       
              hematite-ilmenite, and andalusite-sillimanite at high                          
              pressures and/or temperatures will be elucidated by phase                      
              equilibria experiments, calorimetric measurements,                             
              theoretical modelling, and field studies.  This research                       
              should provide constraints for mineral thermochemical data                     
              and should lead to more accurate quantification of the                         
              intensive variables of metamorphic rocks.   The results of                     
              the research will ultimately find application in studying                      
              pressure-temperature-time paths, fluid flow, diffusion, and                    
              relations between metamorphism and deformation.
