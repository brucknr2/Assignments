Abstract    :
              Abstract for Patrick R. Taylor / University of Idaho / CTS-9220252    The PIs
              propose to produce very fine carbide and boride particles by the techniques of
              plasma synthesis.  They propose to develop a fundamental understanding of the
              reaction kinetics, heat and mass transfer, and nucleation and growth kinetics
              associated with the generation of these particles using a modified previously
              developed non-transferred arc plasma flow reactor.  Once these fine particles
              are obtained, they will be characterized as to their strength, hardness, and
              toughness produced by the sintering and hot isostatic pressing of the
              particles.  The PIs further propose to develop a theoretical model capable of
              describing the nucleation and growth phenomena in these plasma systems.
