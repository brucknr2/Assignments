Abstract    :
              This project is in the general area of analytical and surface                  
              chemistry with an emphasis on bioelectrochemistry.  During the                 
              tenure of this three-year grant, Professor Chambers will                       
              investigate the possibility of electrochemical communication                   
              with polynucleotides or, more specifically, the purine and                     
              pyrimidine groups buried within polynucleotides.  The                          
              experimental techniques will include the use of modified                       
              electrodes and laser-induced fluorescence spectroelectro-                      
              chemistry.  Dr Chambers will design an organic salt electrode                  
              that responds to DNA through intercalation or hydrogen-bonding                 
              interactions.  He will also develop electrochemical tags for                   
              DNA and other polynucleotides similar to fluorescent tags                      
              currently used for spectroscopic investigations.

              Professor Chambers and his students will investigate the                       
              possibility of electrochemical communication with DNA and other                
              polynucleotides by developing novel, modified electrodes and                   
              electrochemical tags similar to spectroscopic tags in common                   
              use today.  The proposed method for the analysis of DNA and                    
              polynucleotides may give rise to bioanalytical techniques with                 
              broad applications in clinical chemistry and biotechnology.
