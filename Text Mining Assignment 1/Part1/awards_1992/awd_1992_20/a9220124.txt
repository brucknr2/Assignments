Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This project will examine the relationship between household                   
              technology and use of time in two ways:                                        
                                                                                             
              1.  Re-analysis of 1965, 1975, and 1985 national household                     
                  technology time diary data, and                                            
              2.  Two new surveys, one local and the other national, the latter              
                  focused on four household technologies.                                    
                                                                                             
              The new surveys will build on phenomena suggested by the re-                   
              analysis of the existing data.  Particular attention is paid to the            
              impact of new communication technologies on the lifestyles and ways            
              of spending time among younger people.
