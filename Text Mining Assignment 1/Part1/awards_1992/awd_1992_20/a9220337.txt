Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This is a theoretical study of: (1) the influence of water-rock                
              interactions on the mineralogic and chemical compositions of the               
              lower oceanic crust and upper an mantle, and (2) an integration of             
              inorganic vent fluid chemistry with hydrothermal alteration of                 
              organic matter at sedimented ridges. Once the major rock-forming               
              element chemistry is better understood, linkages between shallow               
              and deep hydrothermal fluids can be elucidated. Trace element and              
              organic compound transport, as well as alteration and                          
              redistribution, will be incorporated.
