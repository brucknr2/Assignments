Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Leaf growth responses to light are important for a plant to                    
              maximize its photosynthetic capacity while conserving available                
              nutrients and water.  Leaf growth is stimulated photo-                         
              morphogenically by red and blue light acting by separate                       
              mechanisms, and is enhanced by photosynthesis occurring in the                 
              growing cells.  The growth response to light is associated with                
              proton efflux, and other ion fluxes across the plasma membrane.                
              The objectives of this study are to ask:  1. How is the plasma                 
              membrane proton pump regulated by light in epidermal and mesophyll             
              cells?  2. Are light-induced ion fluxes in leaf cells carried in               
              part by ion channels, and if so, does light regulate channel                   
              activity?  3. Will mutants defective in growth responses to light              
              exhibit altered electrical responses to light?  These questions                
              will be approached by electrophysiological (microelectrode and                 
              patch clamp) techniques taking advantage of mutants of Arabidopsis             
              showing altered growth responses to light.                                     
              %%%                                                                            
              Leaf growth responses to light are important for a plant to                    
              maximize its ability to carry out photosynthesis while conserving              
              available nutrients and water.  Leaf growth is stimulated by red               
              and blue light and is enhanced by photosynthesis occurring in the              
              growing cells.  The growth response to light is associated with ion            
              fluxes across the cell membrane.  This project will use electrical             
              techniques to study the mechanisms by which ions move across the               
              membranes of leaf cells in response to light.  The results of this             
              research will clarify the initial events occurring in light                    
              responses of growing leaf cells.
