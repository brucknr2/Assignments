Abstract    :
                   The PI conduct simple shear deformation experiments using a               
              gas-medium deformation apparatus to investigate the mechanisms of              
              structural evolution and the resultant anisotropy in physical                  
              properties (seismic wave velocities, creep strength and melt                   
              permeability) in deformed polycrystalline aggregates of olivine and            
              olivine plus basaltic melt.  Simple shear deformation is critical,             
              because some key informations such as the controlling factors of               
              anisotropic microstructures can only be distinguished in a                     
              rotational deformation mode such as simple shear.  The results of              
              these studies have important applications in (i) interpretation of             
              anisotropic structures in ultramafic rocks and hence the rheology              
              of the upper mantle, (ii) interpretation of seismic anisotropy in              
              terms of modes of mantle convection, (iii) modelling shear                     
              localization in the upper mantle, (iv) modelling melt migration                
              beneath mid-ocean ridges.
