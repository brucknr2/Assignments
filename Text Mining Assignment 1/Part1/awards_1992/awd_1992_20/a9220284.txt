Abstract    :
                   A new category of physics problems suitable for                           
              intermediate-level undergraduate physics courses will be                       
              developed and published.  These problems are to be derived                     
              from current or recent work of physicists actively engaged in                  
              research.  They are to exhibit new, interesting, or                            
              particularly insightful applications of undergraduate physics                  
              to problems, phenomena, or results of contemporary physics                     
              research.  They will be published first in the American                        
              Journal of Physics under the title of "New Problems" and then                  
              subsequently in a loose-leaf format as a resource for teaching                 
              undergraduate physics.
