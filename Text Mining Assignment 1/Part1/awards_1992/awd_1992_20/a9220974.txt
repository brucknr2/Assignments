Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This project will support the visit of twelve young                            
              Russian polymer scientists to meet their counterparts in                       
              the United States.  During the period August 23-28, 1992,                      
              the Russians will attend the national meeting of the                           
              American Chemical Society in Washington, DC.  They will                        
              present posters and generally interact with their American                     
              colleagues.  From August 28-31, 1992, discussions will                         
              continue in the form of a small workshop in which about                        
              twelve young American professors with similar expertise                        
              will participate.  This program will introduce the                             
              Russians to American science and will enable Americans to                      
              develop ties to the new generation of Russian scientists.                      
                                                                                             
              This project in polymer chemistry fulfills the program                         
              objectives of advancing scientific knowledge by enabling                       
              young experts in the US and Russia to combine                                  
              complementary efforts and capabilities in areas of strong                      
              mutual interest and competence on the basis of equality,                       
              reciprocity, and mutuality of benefit.
