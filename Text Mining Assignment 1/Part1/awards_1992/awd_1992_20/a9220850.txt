Abstract    :
              Total nitrogen content of plant tissues and soils is a                         
              widely used assay in ecological research.  We have need for                    
              >800 such assays each year which is twice what our current                     
              analyzer can handle.  Here we request purchase of an                           
              additional nitrogen analyzer and ancillary equipment.  Four                    
              research programs in our department rely heavily upon total                    
              nitrogen determinations.  Two groups focus on plant                            
              responses to stress (drought, nutrient, salinity and extreme                   
              light levels) and how those responses influence the                            
              population and evolutionary responses of herbivorous                           
              insects.  The third group looks at the distribution of plant                   
              communities through time and asks how soil type influences                     
              the persistence of plant communities at particular sites                       
              over thousands of years.  The fourth group focuses on                          
              experimental analysis of the mechanisms of plant competition                   
              for mineral resources during the succession from abandoned                     
              fields to oak savanna.
