Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This is a unit of DOE/NSF/USDA Collaborative Research in Plant                 
              Biology Program.                                                               
                                                                                             
              This award supports a network of plant scientists who investigate              
              dynamic plasma membrane-cell wall interactions.  The plasma                    
              membrane plays a key role in cell wall metabolism which changes                
              during normal growth and development and in response to                        
              environmental and biotic signals.  Recently, several studies have              
              shown that the cytoskeleton is involved in these interactions.                 
              Collaboration among cell biologists, biochemists, physiologists and            
              molecular biologists will likely advance our understanding of the              
              integrated functions of the plant cytoskeleton, plasma membrane,               
              and cell wall.                                                                 
                                                                                             
              Dr. Carpita of Purdue University is the coordinator of the group               
              and there are about 25 scientists from all over the U.S. and some              
              foreign laboratories participating in the group.  The research                 
              coordination group will establish an electronic bulletin board,                
              will organize retreats/workshops for intense discussion, and will              
              promote new research collaborations between participants.
