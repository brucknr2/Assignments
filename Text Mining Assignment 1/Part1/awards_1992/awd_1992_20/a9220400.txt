Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  Four experiments on liquid helium 3 and helium 4 at                       
              temperatures below 0.1K are proposed:  1) Solubility and diffusion-            
              coefficient measurements to test some recent predictions of Fermi              
              Liquid theory.  2) Measurement of the Kapitza thermal conductance              
              and of the transmission of transverse spin waves across the                    
              interface between superfluid A and B phases of helium 3, and 3) a              
              related experiment involving helium 3/helium 4 mixtures, these two             
              experiments being designed to determine the transmission                       
              probabilities of helium 3 quasiparticles across the interfaces.  4)            
              A test of recent theory by measuring the reflection probability of             
              rotons at the free surface of liquid helium 4.                                 
                                                                                             
              The liquid state of helium (and hydrogen), which can only be                   
              produced at extremely low temperatures, close to absolute zero,                
              furnishes an example of a "quantum fluid" where Nature shows us an             
              example of quantum mechanics operating on a "bulk" (or                         
              "macroscopic") scale.  Such a fluid evidences very unusual                     
              properties and offers a fertile ground for research into the                   
              fundamental properties of matter.  The present experiments are                 
              designed to examine some of those properties in depth and thus                 
              deepen our understanding of this strange realm of the physical                 
              world.
