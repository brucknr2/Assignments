Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The ultimate goal of this proposal is to identify the  molecular               
              basis underlying preparation for and induction of  hibernation in              
              mammals. This initial approach involves identification of                      
              hypothalamic genes whose expression is changed in hamsters before              
              vs during a bout of hibernation. This approach is based on the                 
              hypothesis that induction of hibernation in mammals results from               
              altered neural/neurosecretory signaling to central and/or                      
              peripheral regulators/effectors of thermogenesis and/or heat loss              
              AND that these alterations in signalling reflect altered gene                  
              expression. While this hypothesis is reasonable considering the                
              regulatory role played by the hypothalamus and the changes in                  
              thermogenic tissues such as brown fat that considerable difficulty             
              in detecting the hibernation process.
