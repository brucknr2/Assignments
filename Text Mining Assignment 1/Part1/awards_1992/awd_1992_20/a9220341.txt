Abstract    :
              This project is in the general area of analytical and surface                  
              chemistry and in the subfield of surface vibrational spectroscopy.             
              During the tenure of this three-year continuing grant, Professor               
              Langell and her students will develop and test computational                   
              procedures to enhance the applicability of high resolution                     
              electron energy loss spectroscopy (HREELS) to the study of                     
              adsorbates on transition metal oxides (TMOs).  HREELS has proven               
              to be an invaluable tool in the characterization of metal                      
              adsorbates.  Presently, it is only of limited usefulness for the               
              characterization of adsorbates on TMOs because intense surface                 
              phonons from the substrate interfere with the vibrational                      
              spectroscopic signals of interest.  Professor Langell's approach               
              draws upon the Maximum Entropy Method to develop a phonon                      
              deconvolution procedure to remove much of the interfering phonon               
              structure and greatly improve the resolution of TMO-adsorbate                  
              HREELS.                                                                        
              %%%                                                                            
              Attainment of the goals of this project will enable the use of a               
              sensitive vibrational spectroscopic technique (HREELS) for the                 
              detailed characterization of adsorbates on TMOs.  Such systems are             
              of broad technological importance in chemical catalysis.
