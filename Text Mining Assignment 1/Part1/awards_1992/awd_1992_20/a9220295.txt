Abstract    :
              The Theoretical and Computational Chemistry Program of the                     
              Chemistry Division is supporting work at the University of                     
              Delaware under the supervision of Professor Szalewicz to obtain                
              state-of-the-art intermolecular potential energy surfaces for                  
              van der Waals molecules using his recently developed                           
              many-electron formulation of symmetry-adapted perturbation                     
              theory.  Application will be made to systems for which                         
              experimental data are available but for which the                              
              interpretation may be controversial.

              Hydrogen bond formation between molecules is one of the most                   
              important but least understood mechanisms for interaction                      
              between many molecules of biological importance or between such                
              molecules and a solvent.  This project attempts a high level                   
              examination of somewhat simpler systems to develop the basis                   
              for a more complete physical understanding of the interaction.
