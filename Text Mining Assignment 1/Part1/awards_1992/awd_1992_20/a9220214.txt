Abstract    :
                   This award provides one-half the funds required to upgrade a              
              seismic reflection system (seismograph, geophones, sensor cables,              
              GPS receiver, computing hardware/software) that will be operated               
              by the PI, colleagues, and students in the Department of Geology               
              at the University of Georgia. The University is committed to                   
              providing the remaining necessary funds. The seismic measuring                 
              system will be used primarily for refraction and wide-angle                    
              reflection profiling of structures in the crust and shallow mantle             
              in the Appalachian region of the U.S. in support of research                   
              projects and teaching exercises.
