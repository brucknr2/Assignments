Abstract    :
              In  the last few years, several cosmic-ray-produced radionuclides              
              (10Be, 14C, 26Al, 36Cl), as well as stable 3He, 21Ne and 22Ne have been        
              discovered in terrestrial surface materials.  Some of these                    
              nuclides are already employed as tracers in studies of geophysical             
              and geological phenomena and open up a new field of study and are              
              expected to provide essential data on rates of change in global                
              change research.  Such studies require  an accurate knowledge of               
              of the production rates, present and past, which are not currently             
              available.  We are using a direct method for the determination of              
              some of present production rates, by exposing relevant targets at              
              mountain altitudes.  Production rates averaged over the last solar             
              cycles can be obtained by comparing production rates with neutron              
              monitor data.  We are currently evaluating the relevant production             
              ratio P21/P26 of the cosmic-ray-produced nuclides 21Ne and 26Al by             
              isotopic measurements of Ne in quartz samples.  Our preliminary                
              experimental data do not agree well with theoretical predictions.              
              Average production rates over 104-105years can be obtained from                
              measurements of samples of known age.  Measurements of the 3He/21Ne            
              ratio show that 3He is often incompletely retained in quartzites.              
              Therefore, 21Ne production rates and 21Ne/10Be and 21Ne/26Al ratios            
              provide essential information, which is required to evaluate                   
              erosion rates and to define geological processes (uplift,                      
              variations in ice cover etc).
