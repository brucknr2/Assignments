Abstract    :
              This research project will investigate complex metamorphic                     
              textures through a combination of  techniques that model                       
              reaction mechanisms which produce metamorphic textures with                    
              techniques that  provide information about whole rock modes                    
              and mineral compositions along a specified P-T path.                           
              Techniques to be utilized are based upon differential                          
              thermodynamics and irreversible thermodynamics.  The                           
              resultant models will be tested and refined using pelitic                      
              samples from western Maine, and will ultimately be used in                     
              placing constraints on the thermal and tectonic processes                      
              responsible for development of the metamorphic terrane.
