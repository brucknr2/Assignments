Abstract    :
              This award supports a study of sediment cores from the Southern                
              Ocean to extract and interpret paleoceanographic and paleoclimatic             
              information.  The project will examine the impact that                         
              glacial/interglacial changes in Southern Ocean conditions might                
              have had on the stability of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet.                     
              Paleoceanographic conditions, specifically sea-surface temperatures            
              and circulation patterns in the past, will be reconstructed by                 
              studying floral (diatom) composition, percent opal, percent                    
              carbonate, and the Germanium-Silicon ratio in deep ocean cores.                
              This information is important as input to paleoclimatic models and             
              models of interaction between oceans and the West Antarctic Ice
