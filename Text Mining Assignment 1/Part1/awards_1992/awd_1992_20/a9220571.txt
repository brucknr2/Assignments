Abstract    :
              This is a unit of DOE/NSF/USDA Collaborative Research in Plant                 
              Biology Program.                                                               
                                                                                             
              The theme of the interdisciplinary research training group is                  
              global change.  The group involves 10 laboratories whose                       
              expertise ranges from molecular biology to cell and whole plant                
              physiology to ecosystems studies.  Graduate students and                       
              postdoctoral participants will be trained to perform                           
              interdisciplinary work with the techniques from PCR to satellite               
              data reading.  Course work, seminars, invited speakers, and a                  
              series of "hands on" instrumentation tutorials will constitute                 
              the training program.  The program will emphasize innovative                   
              experimental strategies combined with in-depth studies of                      
              selected topics in plant-environment interaction.
