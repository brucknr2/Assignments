Abstract    :
              Recombination, the production of progeny with new combinations of              
              genes, is one of the basic activities of genetic material at all               
              levels of the biological kingdom.  The basic mechanisms of                     
              recombination are not completely understood in any species, but                
              much has been learned in recent years by a combination of molecular            
              and genetic studies in yeast.  The generality of these findings is             
              uncertain, and there is a need for parallel studies in other                   
              eukaryotes.  The mtr gene of Neurospora offers special advantages              
              for studies of mutation and recombination.  Rare segregants can be             
              efficiently detected going in either direction; wildtype to mutant             
              or mutant to wildtype.  The gene hs been cloned and sequenced.  A              
              detailed analysis of spontaneous mutation is being completed which             
              has involved the sequencing of 63 different mtr mutants.  This                 
              system can now be used for a detailed molecular description of                 
              meiotic recombination.

              Recombination, the production of progeny with new combinations of              
              genes, is one of the basic activities of genetic material at all               
              levels of the biological kingdom.  The basic mechanisms of

              much has been learned in recent years by a combination of molecular

              uncertain, and there is a need for parallel studies in other                   
              organisms.  This study of recombination in the filamentous fungus              
              Neurospora will make a significant contribution toward meeting this            
              need.
