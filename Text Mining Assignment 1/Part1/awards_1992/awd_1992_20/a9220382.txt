Abstract    :
              9220382  Neugroschel  The Si/Ge1-x/Si heterojunction bipolar transistor (HBT) is
              one of  the most promising devices for manufacturing Si-based ultrafast  VLSI
              and ULSI circuits.  The GexSi1-x layer, used for the base of the  transistor,
              can be grown by slightly modifying the Si technology  and taking advantage of
              the complete miscibility of Ge and Si to  tailor the profiles of the energy gap
              for optimum performance.  The  proposed work will concentrate on the
              investigation of the  fundamental electronic properties of the composite
              GexSi1-x strained  thin layers grown on silicon substrate.  The properties to
              be  investigated are the transport parameters important primarily to  the
              performance of the Si/GexSi1-x/Si HBT, but useful also for other  applications.
               These include the minority-carrier mobility (or  diffusivity) and lifetime,
              energy gap, GexSi1-x junction. The  investigation will be made as a function of
              growth conditions, the  layer thickness and compostion (Ge content x), strain
              and strain  relaxation (via annealing), dopant impurity concentration and 
              temperature.  It is expected that the proposed research will  significantly
              enhance the present understanding of the bulk and  interface properties of the
              Si/GexSi1-x heterostructures, and will  allow optimization of device to reach
              higher performance not  attainable using the current empirical approach.
