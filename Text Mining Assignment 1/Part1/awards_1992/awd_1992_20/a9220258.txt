Abstract    :
                   This research will test the hypothesis that photosynthetic                
              efficiency and capacity can be predicted from "physiological                   
              reflectance indices" derived from spectral reflectance of                      
              vegetation.  This hypothesis assumes that leaves and canopies                  
              follow ecophysiological "rules" of light energy distribution                   
              resulting in consistent relationships between PAR distribution and             
              photosynthetic fluxes.  Experimental studies employing concurrent              
              measurements of spectral reflectance, leaf gas exchange and                    
              fluorescence on evergreen species will develop a mechanistic                   
              understanding of relationships between photosynthetic regulation               
              and spectral reflectance.  These experiments will be used to derive            
              a leaf-level model incorporating "physiological reflectance                    
              indices" linking spectral reflectance to photosynthetic fluxes.                
              Experimental comparisons of leaf and canopy reflectance will                   
              provide algorithms for predicting photosynthetic efficiency and                
              capacity from canopy spectral reflectance.

              This work enables a young and very promising ecosystem scientist               
              utilizing minority students at an undergraduate institution.                   
              Although the most understanding of physiological function at the               
              leaf and canopy levels, the conclusions may benefit future studies             
              of vegetation-atmosphere interactions involving remote sensing at              
              the landscape level.
