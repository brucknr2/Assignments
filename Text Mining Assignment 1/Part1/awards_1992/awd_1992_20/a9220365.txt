Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  This conference on The Biology and Chemistry of Vision is part            
              of an important series of meetings convened to promote interactions            
              between the top investigators in the field on topics at the                    
              forefront of research on photoreceptors and the retina of the eye.             
              This particular conference will focus on interactions between work             
              on the basic biological mechanisms of photoreception in the eye                
              and the clinical problems related to retinal degeneration.  The                
              conference will lead to new understanding of how the proteins                  
              involved in the biochemistry of vision can be defective, and how               
              those defects can lead to visual disability.  The impact will be on            
              both basic and applied aspects of visual neuroscience, and the                 
              conference will promote interactions that are likely to have an                
              impact on neuroscience in general.
