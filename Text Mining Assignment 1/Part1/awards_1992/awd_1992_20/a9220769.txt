Abstract    :
              This research is concerned with improving the efficiency and  robustness of
              parameter estimation schemes employed by implantable  and portable devices for
              cardioversion and defibrillation.  The  goal of the research is to replace the
              ad-hoc estimation schemes  used in present generation devices by robust
              estimators that  produce optimal minimum variance estimates for a wide range of
               unknown error distributions, and which maintain close-to-optimal  performance
              in the presence of parameter fluctuations.  These  objectives are pursued
              through estimation schemes that are based on  the application of Order
              Statistic (OS) operations to the data.
