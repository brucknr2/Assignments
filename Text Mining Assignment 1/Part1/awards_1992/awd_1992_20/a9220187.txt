Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              A symposium on Molecular Evolution of Physiological Processes will             
              be held in September, 1993 at the Marine Biological Laboratory in              
              Woods Hole, Massachusetts, under the auspices of the Society of                
              General Physiologists.  This Symposium will bring together                     
              scientists who study cytoskeletal and membrane functions with                  
              scientists whose research is focused upon molecular evolution or on            
              mechanisms that generate genetic diversity.  Four lecture sessions             
              will set the intellectual framework of the symposium: (1)                      
              approaches to analyzing nucleic acid and protein sequences and                 
              applications to phylogenetic problems; (2) recently appreciated                
              genetic mechanisms that may underlie the evolution of increasingly             
              complex biological systems; (3) proteins of the actin/myosin                   
              cytoskeleton: the variety of isoforms and the correlated functions             
              these play in cell structure and behavior; and (4) structure,                  
              function and evolution of plasma membrane proteins.  Sessions 3 and            
              4 emphasize that molecular-level studies of physiological processes            
              are very profitably informed by ideas developed in the fields of               
              molecular evolution and genetics, and that conserved structural                
              motifs characterize superfamilies of proteins that may function                
              through homologous mechanisms.  There will also be poster sessions             
              and open discussion/workshops on key topics.  Keynote addresses                
              will highlight perspectives from immunology and integrative                    
              biology.                                                                       
              %%%                                                                            
              A symposium on Molecular Evolution of Physiological Processes will             
              be held in September, 1993 at the Marine Biological Laboratory in              
              Woods Hole, Massachusetts, under the auspices of the Society of                
              General Physiologists.  This Symposium will bring together                     
              scientists who study cytoskeletal and membrane functions with                  
              scientists whose research is focused upon molecular evolution or on            
              mechanisms that generate genetic diversity.  A major emphasis of               
              the conference is that molecular-level studies of physiological                
              processes can be illuminated by ideas developed in the fields of               
              molecular evolution and genetics.
