Abstract    :
              Rao         This research is studying novel algorithms for computing  solutions
              to least squares problems with constraints, especially  those problems that are
              underdetermined. The primary application  is expected to be in
              Magnetoencephalography (MEG), a potentially  new modality for the imaging of
              the brain. Both algorithm  development and analysis are being considered, with
              MEG providing  the forum for the testing and evaluation of these algorithms. It
               is expected that this research will greatly enhance our  understanding of
              nonlinear iterative techniques.
