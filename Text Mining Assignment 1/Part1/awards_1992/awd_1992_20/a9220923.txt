Abstract    :
              This award is for support of a one year study to complete analyses             
              of samples obtained under a previous grant (DPP-8917581).   The                
              analyses to be performed include accelerator mass spectrometric                
              (AMS) dating of rock samples collected in Antarctica for exposure              
              age dating.  This work will enhance current understanding of the               
              geologic history of the Dry Valleys and adjacent terrain during the            
              past 7 million years, the period of time accesssible to the mix of             
              isotopes currently being measured.  A sample preparation train                 
              dedicated to preparing terrestrial samples for calcium-41 analyses             
              will also be constructed to allow the addition of this isotope to              
              the suite of isotopes currently being measured on these samples                
              (Beryllium-10, Aluminum 26, Chlorine-36, and Carbon-14).
