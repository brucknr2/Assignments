Abstract    :
              9220219  Comrie      The Principal Investigators will prepare a descriptive
              grammar of  Tsez (Dido), a hitherto little investigated language of the 
              Daghestan region in the Caucasus mountains, in collaboration with  a native
              speaker of Tsez.  The grammar will throw light on a number  of phenomena of
              current interest in linguistic theory, including  gender/class systems,
              ergativity, clause linkage, and extraction  phenomena.  In addition to the
              grammar, the Principal Investigators  intend to prepare a collection of Tsez
              texts with dictionary for  publication, and to publish articles on points of
              more general  interest in Tsez grammar.  This detailed work on the Tsez
              language  will also contribute to our understanding of historical-linguistic 
              and ethnic patterns in Daghestan, an important cultural area on the  border of
              Russian and Islamic spheres of influence.  ***
