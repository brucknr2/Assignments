Abstract    :
              The relationship between krill and its consumers is considered                 
              crucial to the dynamics of the Antarctic ecosystem.  To date,                  
              most studies of this relationship have concentrated on simply                  
              describing patterns of association.  This research will go beyond              
              a descriptive approach, and probe the mechanisms that generate                 
              patterns of association between selected seabirds and patches of               
              krill.  The focus is on seabird species that are abundant at                   
              South Georgia in winter and that are known to feed heavily on                  
              krill: Gentoo Penguins, Common Diving-Petrels, Kerguelen Petrels               
              and Blue Petrels.  The study includes several components.  These               
              include the quantification of seabird distribution relative to                 
              the location and size of krill patches and the quantification of               
              individual behavior of seabirds as a function of krill density,                
              krill patch size, distance from krill patches and abundance of                 
              other consumers.  Data on individual behavior will be used to                  
              construct partial differential equation models of seabird                      
              distribution.  Patterns of association predicted by these models               
              will be compared to observed patterns of association.  Finally,                
              an assessment of how birds actually capture prey such as krill,                
              and how the potential cost of foraging increases as weather                    
              conditions become severe, will be made.  This research will unite              
              several lines of investigation into a synthesized portrait of how              
              birds respond to spatial and temporal variability in resources                 
              within the Antarctic environment.
