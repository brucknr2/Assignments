Abstract    :
                   The program will investigate the rotational bursting of F-                
              Coronal dust particles to high density (108 protons/cm3) Coronal              
              Mass Ejections in the F-Coronal region.  Rotational bursting of F-             
              Coronal dust make take place due to the tension caused by high spin            
              rate, which can be driven by four spin mechanisms.                             
                   Four different spin mechanisms will be investigated                       
              theoretically by this proposal.                                                
                   Repeated rotational bursting from the parent particle and its             
              fragments will alter the size distribution of the dust, and                    
              ultimately result in ejecting the resulting smaller particles from             
              the solar system by the action of solar radiation pressure                     
              overcoming the gravitational attraction of the Sun.
