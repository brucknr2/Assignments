Abstract    :
              This project will be the first systematic oceanographic study of               
              the continental shelves of the Amundsen and Bellings-hausen Seas,              
              and will include temperature and salinity profiling, water sampling            
              for ocean chemistry, and continuous precision bathymetry.                      
                                                                                             
              Upwelling warm deep water covers the Amundsen and Bellings-hausen              
              shelves and delivers significant amounts of heat to the sea ice and            
              fringing ice shelves.  The regional precipitation is heavy, and has            
              historically maintained a perennial ice cover.                                 
                                                                                             
              However, within the last few years satellite images have shown that            
              the ice has been receding dramatically, with large areas of open               
              water persisting through the winter in sectors that earlier had                
              been ice-covered.  These anomalous ice distributions are likely to             
              have been accompanied by altered surface water properties, and                 
              possibly changes in the deep vertical circulation.  There are                  
              indications that the conditions favoring a reduction in the sea ice            
              may migrate westward toward the Ross Sea, and may have influenced              
              a gradual warming over recent decades on the western side of the               
              Antarctic Peninsula.                                                           
                                                                                             
              The project will make use of the R/V Nathaniel B. Palmer in two                
              cruises; one in the late austral summer 1993-1994, and a subse-                
              quent cruise in September and October to observe late winter                   
              conditions.
