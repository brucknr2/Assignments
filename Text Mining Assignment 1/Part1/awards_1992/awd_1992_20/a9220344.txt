Abstract    :
                   This award provides 64% of the funds needed to acquire a noble            
              gas mass spectrometer system to be installed and operated in the               
              Department of Geological Sciences at the Ohio State University. The            
              University is committed to providing the necessary remaining funds.            
                   The principal use of the equipment will be for geochemical                
              research and teaching using the radioactive decay of potassium to              
              argon for dating geologic ages of minerals and rocks.
