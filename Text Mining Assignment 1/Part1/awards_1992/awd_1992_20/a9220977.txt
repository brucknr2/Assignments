Abstract    :
                   This project will provide estimates of the stay rate of                   
              foreign doctorate recipients from U. S. universities by examining              
              Social Security Administration data on those working in the                    
              United States.  This research will strengthen current information              
              of stay rates of foreign students obtained from the "states                    
              intentions" given in the annual NSF Survey of Earned Doctorates.               
              Intentions can change.  The research approach utilizes the social              
              security numbers of foreign nationals who obtained doctorates                  
              in 1983, 1985, and 1986, to determine who is earning wages in                  
              later years (1985-90).  A similar study was conducted in 1985 on               
              one year of doctoral data, in 1982, measuring stay rates one and               
              two years after completion of the doctorate.  The results of the               
              first study were very accurate.  The current study would update                
              information on the stay rate of recent doctoral recipients and                 
              expand information on the length of stay of up to seven years.                 
                                                                                             
                   This information of employed foreign S&E doctorates is an                 
              important component of the S&E labor force statistics and of                   
              vital interest to Congress and science policy decision-makers.
