Abstract    :
                   This award supports a conference entitled:   The 1993 John                
              H. Barrett Memorial Lectures -- Infinite Dimensional Stochastic                
              Differential Equations.  The conference will be held March 25-28,              
              1993, on the campus of the University of Tennessee.  The theme                 
              for these lectures will be infinite dimensional stochastic                     
              differential equations.  Each invited speaker will present a                   
              series of three expository lectures surveying a topic which lies               
              within the realm of the chosen theme.  The main objective of the               
              conference is to provide the participants the opportunity to gain              
              a rapid and concise introduction to the rapidly developing fields              
              of infinite dimensional SDE's and the related measure valued                   
              processes.
