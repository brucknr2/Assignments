Abstract    :
              9220886   Paerl   The ability to fix atmospheric N2 in oxygenated N-limited
              surfaces waters should cyanobacteria (HC).  Despite their periodic dominance in
              small freshwater impoundments however.  HC are often conspicuously absent in
              chronic N-limited large lakes, estuaries and coastal waters; yet these waters
              generally exhibit N:P loading and concentration ratios favorable for HC N2
              fixers.  Excessive turbulence may prevent the establishment and dominance of
              heterocystous bloom forming taxi in wind and tide-exposed largewater bodies. 
              The project will examine this ecological paradox by experimentally evaluating
              the relative roles large-scale vertical mixing and small-scale shear play in
              conrolling structural and consortial integrity, growth and bloom formation in
              natural and cultured HC populations.  N-limited estuarine (Neuse River, NC),
              large lake (Tahoe, CA-NV) and coastal (Boque Sound, NC), support benthic but
              not planktonic N2 will serve as experimental field sites.  We will utilize
              concentric cylndrical Couette vessels for evaluating the structural and growth
              impacts of small-scale shear regimes (representative of turbulent surface
              waters) on common HC species.  %%%  This work will elucidate environmental
              factors controlling N2 fixation and N-limitation  on regional and global
              scales.  Planktonic cyanobacteria contribute to primary production,
              entrophication, nitrogen availability and flux.  This work facilities
              predictive modeling of HC blooms and resultant regional and global C and N
              budgets and fluxes.
