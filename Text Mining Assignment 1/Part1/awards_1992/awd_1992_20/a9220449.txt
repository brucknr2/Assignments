Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  This project will examine household economic strategies                   
              and wild resource exploitation associated with market                          
              integration in a peasant community in an Amazonian                             
              ecological reserve.  The central question is how the                           
              increasing market integration will affect traditional                          
              resource exploitation, household economics, and intra-                         
              community relations.  The research represents a unique                         
              opportunity to examine an isolated population wherein a                        
              traditional, subsistence resource use system based on common                   
              property is influenced by increased outside demand; and it                     
              is important in understanding human impact on the                              
              environment in protected areas.  It will also contribute to                    
              our understanding the effects of governmental control on                       
              protected areas which have human residents.
