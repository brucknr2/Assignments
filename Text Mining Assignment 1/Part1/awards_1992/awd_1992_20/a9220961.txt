Abstract    :
                   Corrosion conditions affect a wide range of industries.  In               
              oil industry, the main cause of pipeline fractures is corrosion.               
              Generally speaking, it is not economic to separate the oil and gas             
              and transport them in different pipelines.   In the oil industry,              
              the oil and gas, together with carbon dioxide and brine which are              
              used in enhanced oil recovery methods, are flowed together in one              
              large diameter pipeline.  These multiphase flows have very                     
              different characteristics than single phase flows.  Planning                   
              activities at Ohio University and the University of Illinois have              
              developed an industry based research Center program in                         
              investigating the corrosion in multiphase systems.                             
                   The formation of this Center is based on the early work                   
              supported by some oil/gas and animal farm building industries .                
              The proposed Center program is to develop an integration of                    
              industry, Ohio University, and the University of Illinois based on             
              the NSF I/UCRC model.                                                          
                   The initial research agenda of Ohio University/University of              
              Illinois's Industry/University Cooperative Research Center for                 
              Corrosion in Multiphase System will address the following topics:              
              1) Corrosion in Oil and Gas Pipelines, 2) Corrosion in Animal and              
              Plant Confinement Facilities, and 3) Bacterial/Microbial Corrosion.            
                   Currently, there are fifteen company sponsors for the Center              
              (ten companies in the research group at Ohio University and five               
              companies in the research group at the University of Illinois)                 
              committing approximately $365,000/year.                                        
                   The Principal Investigator/Center Director and his colleagues             
              at Ohio University and the University of Illinois have the                     
              knowledge and facilities to run this Center.                                   
                   The Program Manager recommends Ohio University and the                    
              University of Illinois be awarded $100,000 for the first year of a             
              five-year continuing award.   The continueing award for the                    
              University of Illinois will be based on the significant growth of              
              the industrial support in the end of the first year.                           
                   Near the end of the first year the Program Director will                  
              review the progress of the Center on a number of criteria,                     
              including the following: 1) the extent to which the university-                
              industry interaction is developing; 2) the extent to which the                 
              support  base is developing; 3) the extent to which a robust                   
              research program is developing.  If the review is satisfactory, the            
              Program Director will recommend support for the next period of this            
              continuing award.
