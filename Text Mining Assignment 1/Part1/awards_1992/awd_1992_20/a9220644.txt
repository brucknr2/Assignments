Abstract    :
                   The Chicago group is concerned with a broad range of                      
              research in gravitational physics.  Some mathematical issues                   
              related to the theory of relativistic dissipative fluids will                  
              be investigated in detail; in particular, the "Navier-Stokes                   
              limit" of dissipative fluid equations will be studied and they                 
              will investigate the issue of how "close" solutions to                         
              different fluid equations having the same Navier-Stokes limit                  
              are to each other.  The possibility of formulating a                           
              satisfactory and interpretable quantum gravity theory for                      
              homogeneous cosmologies in analogy with the theory of a                        
              relativistic particle will be studied, and properties of the                   
              Wheeler-DeWitt equation for inhomogeneous cosmological models                  
              will be investigated.  They will examine the issue of unitary                  
              equivalence of quantum field constructions associated with                     
              Hadamard vacuum states in globally hyperbolic spacetimes with                  
              a compact Cauchy surface.  Numerous additional topics in                       
              classical general relativity, quantum field theory in curved                   
              spacetime, and quantum gravity will be investigated.  The                      
              basic goal of all of this research is to obtain a deeper                       
              understanding of mathematical and physical issues in classical                 
              general relativity, and to make progress toward formulating a                  
              quantum theory of gravitation.
