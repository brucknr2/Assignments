Abstract    :
              Laser feedback microscopy (LFM), a new type of scanning                        
              confocal optical microscopy, originated in this laboratory.                    
              Presently, we have produced a LFM which measures surface                       
              topography of low-reflectance samples with a z-resolution                      
              down to a nanometer (10-9 meter).  LFM, a far-field optical                    
              microscopic technique, allows the examination of biological                    
              samples under         physiological conditions; there is no                    
              requirement for transfer to a high-vacuum environment or the                   
              imposition of other special preparative conditions, e.g.,                      
              staining or shadowing. We are requesting funds to further                      
              develop and extend the construction of prototype instruments                   
              and their application to LFM imaging of biological and other                   
              materials. The major goal presented in this proposal is the                    
              attainment of LFM x,y-resolution in the 10-50nm range,                         
              rivaling that of         electron microscopy and approaching                   
              the resolution of surface-probe techniques such as scanning-                   
              tunneling and atomic-force microscopy. In addition, LFM has                    
              the capability of measuring microscopically the optical                        
              properties of materials; we will utilize this unique feature                   
              to provide new methods of "optical contrast" resulting in                      
              unconventional microscope images conveying important                           
              information about biological preparations. Finally, a fully-                   
              instrumented, computer-console controlled LFM with the                         
              highest possible resolution will be built for general use in                   
              the biological sciences.
