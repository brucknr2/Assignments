Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Measurements of the peculiar motions of galaxies are proving to                
              be one of our most direct probes of the large-scale distribution               
              of matter in the local universe.  This information bears on a                  
              variety of issues, including the amount and nature of dark matter              
              and the birth and evolution of structure in the universe in the                
              context of the big bang model.  The research to be conducted with              
              this grant will involve an observational program to measure                    
              improved distances to galaxies.  This will provide peculiar                    
              motions of unprecedented accuracy for a sample of hundreds of                  
              galaxies spread over a significant volume of space.  The                       
              availability of such data should allow a much more detailed and                
              relatively bias-free map of the distribution of dark matter.                   
              Such a map is essential for evaluating the ability of numerical                
              models of structure formation to simulate the real universe, and,              
              through comparison with maps of the distribution of luminous                   
              galaxies, instructive as to the process of galaxy formation.                   
                                                                                             
              The Principal Investigator is highly regarded for his research in              
              this area.
