Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  The objective of this research is the measurement of lightning            
              channels using a radio frequency interferometer during a                       
              coordinated field experiment deployed near Orlando International               
              Airport.  This interferometer, capable of measuring the horizontal             
              structure and evolution of lightning discharges, will be compared              
              with the three dimensional ones measured by a French team using                
              another interferometer.  Both systems are equipped with automatic              
              processing which will enable the structure and evolution of an                 
              electrical discharge to be displayed as it develops.  Cognate                  
              observations of air motions and precipitation by three doppler                 
              radars will greatly benefit the interpretation of thunderstorm                 
              structure and lightning activity.
