Abstract    :
              Evidence  exits from several parts of Gondwana for at least one                
              major, continental ice  sheet during the Late Ordovician and Early             
              Silurian.  Yet various sources of geological evidence suggest high             
              atmospheric  pCO2 at this time, and Berner's (1990,1991)                       
              Geochemical                                                                    
              cycling model indicates that the amount may have been as high or               
              higher than 13 times the present atmospheric level.  To resolve                
              this apparent paradox (high pCO2 would be expected to imply an ice-            
              free  Earth) the following approach will be followed:                          
                   1) Two periods will be studied: the Middle Ordovician, which              
              lacks evidence for polar ice, and the Ashgill (Late Ordovician)                
              which has evidence for the largest ice extend.                                 
                   2) An atmospheric general circulation model GCM will be                   
              applied to the study of Ordovician climates, and the results of                
              this will then be used to drive a spatially resolved geochemical               
              cycling model (which   considers geographical variations in climate            
              and paleolithology).                                                           
              We will first model the climates of both periods with a CO2 level              
              of 13xPAL.  If differences in geography cannot account for the                 
              climate difference then we will progressively lover the Late                   
              Ordovician CO2 levels until we find that snow remains throughout               
              the year where the geological evidence indicates   an ice cap.  In             
              this way we can determine the range of  pCO2 values  which is                  
              climatically compatible with the glaciological evidence .  We will             
              then run a global geochemical cycling model, in part to provide an             
              additional means of estimating/confirming pCO2  by seeing which                
              climate, i.e., weathering regime, generates a CO2 consumption rate             
              that is consistent with the inferred   rate of production via                  
              volcanism and metamorphism.  In particular we will examine the                 
              hypothesis that increased (terrestrial) volcanism in the Middle                
              Ordovician led to increased (terrestrial) silicate weathering in               
              the Late Ordovician.  Increased weathering would mean that the                 
              carbon cycle was in balance at a lower pCO2  level than current                
              model indicate, and thus allow glaciation.  This study of the                  
              Middle and Late Ordovician will allow us to look at the evolution              
              to a glaciated state, and will be a test of the importance of                  
              atmospheric CO2 as a prime governor of climate on Earth.
