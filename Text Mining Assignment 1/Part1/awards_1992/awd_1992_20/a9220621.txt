Abstract    :
                   This research concerns the role of aggression, reproductive               
              mode and clonal diversity in the observed competitive displacements            
              among geckos in the tropical Pacific.  The PI has documented a                 
              wide-scale biogeographic pattern in which a house gecko,                       
              Hemidactyplus frenatus, upon introduction to islands in the                    
              Pacific, replaces other species as the common urban gecko.  Two of             
              the species (H.garnotti and Lepidodactylus lugubris) being replaced            
              reproduce parthenogenetically.  There is a strong negative                     
              numerical effect of H.frenatus on L. lugubris both locally and on              
              a broad geographic scale throughout the Pacific, and also a strong             
              agonistic asymmetry between H.frenatus and L. lugubris.                        
              This research will assess factors that enable an invading species              
              to cause a decline in native species.  The experimental design will            
              test the hypothesis that the agonistic dominance of H. frenatus                
              over L.lugubris is the primary mechanism of competition, but will              
              also enable quantification of exploitative mechanisms.  With the               
              use of 20 abandoned aircraft revetments constructed during World               
              War II (located on the grounds of N.A.S. Barbers Point on Oahu),               
              the PI can manipulate components of agonistic interaction and prey             
              distribution on a large scale with many replicate treatments.                  
              %%%                                                                            
              The results will be applied to the preservation and management of              
              native communities, with the goal of protecting these communities              
              from invading exotic species.
