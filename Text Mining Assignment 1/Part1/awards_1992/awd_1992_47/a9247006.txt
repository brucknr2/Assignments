Abstract    :
                   This supplemental award will fund a one year program titled,              
              "Environmental Issues in the Science Classroom:  Management of                 
              Hazardous Substances", at the NJIT Hazardous Substance Management              
              Research Center (HSMRC), an NSF I/UCRC.  This project is designed              
              to improve the teaching of science at the junior high/middle school            
              level (grades 6-8) through an integration of professional                      
              development activities for teachers.  Sixteen (16) junior                      
              high/middle school teachers will participate in a 6-week summer                
              (1992) program which will consist of a 3-week intensive, content               
              based workshop followed by a 3-week internship in a HSMRC                      
              affiliated industrial laboratory.  During the following 1992-1993              
              academic year, teachers will integrate their experiences into their            
              science curriculum, with the assistance of NJIT faculty involved in            
              curriculum improvement activities at these grade levels.   This                
              project is a continuation of a highly successful program undertaken            
              by NJIT in the summer of 1991.  This project will be funded for one            
              year at $104,165.  The Education and Human Resources Directorate,              
              Teacher Enhancement Program will provide one-half of the total                 
              funding for this project.                                                      
                   The Program Director recommends that NJIT be awarded a total              
              of $104,165 for one year.  Of this amount the I/UCRC program will              
              provide $5,208, the Engineering Infrastructure Development Division            
              will provide $48,874, and the Teacher Enhancement Program in the               
              Education and Human Resources Directorate will provide $52,082.
