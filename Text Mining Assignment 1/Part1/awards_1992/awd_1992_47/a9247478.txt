Abstract    :
                   Under the award CCR-9120995, the Principle Investigator and his           
              colleagues at SUNY Stonybrook are continuing their NSF funded research         
              on verification tools for concurrent systems and on software                   
              capitalization of the findings.  Simultaneously, E. Madelaine and his          
              collaborators at INRIA are engaged in an independent, closely related          
              project.  This supplemental award provides travel money to INRIA for           
              the P. I. and one graduate student so that the two activities can be           
              combined at the implementation stage in the form of a front-end                
              generator accepting language specifications and producing routines to          
              compile designs into finite state machines.  INRIA will support a              
              comparable coordination effort by the European investigators.
