Abstract    :
              The Chemistry Department is purchasing computers and                           
              accessories to make computer technology an integral part of                    
              undergraduate education.  Both locally generated and commercial                
              software is being used for simulations, data acquisition and                   
              analysis in general, analytical and physical chemistry courses.                
              Molecular modeling is undertaken by organic and biochemistry                   
              students. New experiments such as a comparison of the two-                     
              dimensional NMR based conformation of valinomycin to that                      
              obtained from modeling studies, molecular mechanics and docking                
              in the oxidation of bicyclic alcohols are being introduced.
