Abstract    :
              The learning environment for minority students in statistics                   
              and related courses is being improved by using appropriate                     
              multimedia classroom technology.  Students are more actively                   
              involved through increased emphasis on analyzing and solving                   
              problems with an ability to interact directly with the                         
              instructor in the learning process.  Students are encouraged to                
              pool their resources around the computer, working in teams or                  
              cooperative learning groups to solve difficult but meaningful                  
              problems.  Two introductory statistics courses are                             
              involved.This project represents the coordinated efforts of the                
              Statistics faculties in the Departments of Information Systems                 
              and Decision Sciences and Economics to improve the performance                 
              levels of  students in Statistics.  The objectives of the                      
              project are to:  utilize advances in technology and results of                 
              research to change the teaching method and improve the learning                
              of statistics; facilitate and promote the use of problem                       
              solving to learn statistics (including related courses like                    
              Operations Research and Econometrics); and encourage and                       
              enhance the study of statistics by minorities through                          
              identification and reduction of barriers to success.
