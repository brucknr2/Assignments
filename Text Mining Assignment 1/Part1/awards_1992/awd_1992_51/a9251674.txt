Abstract    :
              The Department of Chemistry is acquiring aFourier-transform                    
              infrared (FTIR) spectrometer to use in a variety of courses in                 
              the chemistry program.  Students in Organic Chemistry II and                   
              III, Physical Chemistry III, Instrumental Analysis, and                        
              Physical Biochemistry are using the instrument in experiments                  
              involving solids, liquids, gases, and solutions, and particular                
              emphasis is being placed on having the students discover the                   
              differences between the kinds of experiments and results which                 
              can be obtained on dispersive versus Fourier-transform                         
              instruments.  A major use of the instrument is by                              
              undergraduates involved in three different ongoing research                    
              programs in the department.
