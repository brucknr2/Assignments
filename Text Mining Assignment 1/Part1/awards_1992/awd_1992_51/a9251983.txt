Abstract    :
              Rapid changes in technology sometimes make obsolete some of the                
              more applied parts of an engineering curriculum, which are                     
              often the laboratories.  This is particularly true of the                      
              automatic control systems laboratory because of its                            
              interdisciplinary nature.  Advances in sensor technology,                      
              microprocessor technology, and the availability of new and more                
              efficient actuators have had considerable influence on how                     
              machines, power plants, manufacturing processes, and automotive                
              vehicles are controlled.  Also, the increase in complexity of                  
              control systems requires both individual and team efforts.  A                  
              challenge to educators in the control systems area is to                       
              prepare graduates who have excellent hands-on skills and team                  
              oriented interpersonal skills.                                                 
                                                                                             
              The aim of this project is to provide engineering juniors and                  
              seniors with a laboratory environment where: (1) they have the                 
              opportunity to sharpen their hands-on skills by working with                   
              cost effective state-of-the-art equipment, and (2) they are                    
              required to work as a highly interactive team.                                 
                                                                                             
              The award will be used to purchase a variety of transducers,                   
              actuators, electromechanical breadboarding kits, and computer                  
              interfacing equipment.  By working with electromechanical                      
              breadboarding kits the students can undertake innovative                       
              laboratory projects. The project provides a laboratory                         
              experience which fosters team effort and communication skills.                 
              It impacts about 90 students per year in electrical and                        
              mechanical engineering departments.
