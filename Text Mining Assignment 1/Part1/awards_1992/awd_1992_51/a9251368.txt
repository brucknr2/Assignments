Abstract    :
              The laboratory component of a materials course within an                       
              associate degree engineering technology program is being                       
              enhanced in two areas of study: effects of operating conditions                
              on materials and the effect of tempering on the properties of                  
              steel.  The enhancements are being provided by adding a new                    
              impact tester, and expanding the heat treating and sample                      
              preparation capabilities.  In addition to the standard impact                  
              test (energy vs. temperature), students study the effect of                    
              tempering temperature on steel, and the effect of overaging on                 
              precipitation hardening aluminum alloys.  This equipment also                  
              is being used to demonstrate the effects of thermal damage                     
              during grinding operations for the non-credit Grinding                         
              Technology program run by Waterbury State Technical College in                 
              conjunction with the Grinding Research Center of the University                
              of Connecticut.
