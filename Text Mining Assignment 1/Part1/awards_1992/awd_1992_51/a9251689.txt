Abstract    :
              This project develops an instrumentation laboratory for                        
              machinery diagnostics and condition monitoring to meet the need                
              for imparting hands-on, technical skills related to the dynamic                
              characterization, detection and prediction of incipient                        
              failures of machine components.  Diagnostics concepts such as                  
              resonant and off-resonant response, Fourier spectrum, transfer                 
              function, coherence and cascading of vibration signals are                     
              demonstrated, as well as introduction to the selection of                      
              transducers and their computer interface for rapid data                        
              acquisition and analysis.  Instrumentation applications for                    
              machine diagnostics is central to this project.  The laboratory                
              enables cohesive and effective instruction of basic vibration                  
              principles and their application for machine diagnosis, to the                 
              four year upper level undergraduate engineering technology                     
              students of Texas A&M University.  The laboratory is used in                   
              three interrelated courses, namely Applied Vibrations,                         
              Instrumentation, and Electro-Mechanical Systems.  Nearly 150                   
              students annually from the mechanical, manufacturing and                       
              electronics engineering technology specialties will benefit.
