Abstract    :
              The project will enhance upper-level undergraduate experiences                 
              in molecular biology in four ways:  1) improve the required                    
              Genetics course by increasing student access to its hands-on                   
              recombinant DNA component;  2) initiate a Molecular Biology                    
              Techniques course;  3) engage more students in undergraduate                   
              research;  and 4) widen the scope of this research.  Students                  
              will clone a well-defined DNA fragment in a plasmid and express                
              it in a vector, construct and screen a simple gene library                     
              using colony lifts and non-radioactive probe detection systems,                
              PCR amplify a DNA sequence, and sequence DNA.  The improvements                
              are modeled after a NSF-supported Faculty Enhancement                          
              biotechnology course at Boston University which uses E. coli's                 
              gene system as a cohesive framework for these activities.                      
              Hands-on laboratories and a wider scope of undergraduate                       
              research activities will open basic science career options to                  
              talented students and improve their successful entry into                      
              graduate and professional programs and the high technology                     
              workplace.
