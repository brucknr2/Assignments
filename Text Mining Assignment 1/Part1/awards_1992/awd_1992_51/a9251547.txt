Abstract    :
              Students study a single model system, the enteric nervous                      
              system of the guinea pig, in order to learn how to address a                   
              research problem at multiple levels.  Techniques utilized                      
              include:  (1) bioassays to determine the effects of                            
              neurochemicals, (2) immunohistochemical localization of                        
              endogenous neurochemicals, and (3) determination of the                        
              distribution of neurochemical receptor binding sites.                          
              Equipment includes a tissue bath with an interface system for                  
              computerized data capture of bioassay data; and epifluorescent                 
              microscopes (equipped with a brightfield cube and a darkfield                  
              condenser) for localization of neuropeptides.  Students design                 
              and perform an original research project and present their                     
              results in the form of a scientific manuscript.
