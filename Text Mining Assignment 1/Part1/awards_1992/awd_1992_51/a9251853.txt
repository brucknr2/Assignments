Abstract    :
               A digitized local database has been provided by the Tennessee                 
              Valley Authority to support undergraduate training at                          
              University of Tennessee at Chattanooga in ARC/INFO and related                 
              systems in order to develop a professionally trained workforce                 
              to staff federal, state, local, and private resource management                
              agencies.  This  database together with the requested equipment                
              will enable the Biological and Environmental Sciences                          
              Department to improve its environmental science curriculum and,                
              at the same time, give its undergraduate students hands-on                     
              experience with Geographic Information Systems and Remote                      
              Sensing technology . The project should produce environmental                  
              science graduates better prepared to enter a rapidly expanding                 
              job market or continue in graduate education.
