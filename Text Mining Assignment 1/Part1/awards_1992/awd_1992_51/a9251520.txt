Abstract    :
              The Department of Geology is purchasing a computer controlled                  
              size analysis instrument.  This equipment is used in the                       
              analysis of sand and fine grained sediment samples collected in                
              coordinated field/lab exercises in introductory geology,                       
              geomorphology, hydrogeology and in independent student                         
              research.  It allows students to conduct detailed and accurate                 
              analyses of geologic materials, including provisions for data                  
              reduction and graphic presentation of analytical results with                  
              a minimum of time expenditure and sample preparation.                          
              Automated sediment analysis enhances the existing curriculum in                
              geology by introducing students to modern analytical                           
              techniques.  Grain size distributions are an important                         
              descriptive tool used by geologists to characterize                            
              depositional processes or environments of deposition.  In                      
              addition, grain size and sorting are important controls on                     
              permeability of unconsolidated deposits.
