Abstract    :
              The Department of Earth and Environmental Sciences is                          
              purchasing a side-scan sonar/subbottom profiling system for                    
              fluvial, lake, estuarine and Long Island Sound field studies                   
              in introductory and upper-division courses, as well as                         
              undergraduate research.  The coupling of this new system with                  
              existing marine equipment is enabling students to study                        
              fundamental sedimentologic, geomorphic, and oceanographic                      
              principles, as well as gain experience in modern methods of                    
              data acquisition and image interpretation.  Students, through                  
              their courses and research, are making a major contribution to                 
              the database on Connecticut's rivers, lakes, and estuaries, and                
              on Long Island Sound.
