Abstract    :
              The project is designed to enhance the undergraduate Computer                  
              Science curriculum with parallel processing and graphics                       
              courses and laboratory work.  The laboratory will be equipped                  
              with a reconfigurable transputer-based multicomputer system                    
              which consists of 32 IMS T800 nodes each with 1 Mbyte RAM.  The                
              system supports concurrent programming using OCCAM-2, parallel-                
              C, and parallel-Fortran languages to implement parallel                        
              algorithms under various fixed or dynamically variable                         
              topologies.  Two SGI INDIGO workstations are used as the host                  
              machine which provides for the system network accessing                        
              function and supports graphics capabilities.  The facility will                
              be shared by a class of 35 students and serve seven                            
              undergraduate courses in Computer Architecture, Programming                    
              Languages, Computer Algorithms, and Computer Graphics.  The                    
              laboratory will also help undergraduate students gain hands-on                 
              experience of parallel processing, concurrent programming, and                 
              computer graphics.  The systems are also suitable for                          
              conducting special course projects under the supervision of a                  
              faculty member.  The dissemination plan will emphasize a                       
              workshop with participation of all interested colleges and                     
              universities.
