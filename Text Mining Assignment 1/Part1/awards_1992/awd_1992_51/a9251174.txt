Abstract    :
              The capabilities of the existing Transportation Systems                        
              Laboratory in the Department of Civil Engineering at the                       
              Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University are being                  
              improved to the benefit of undergraduate students enrolled in                  
              transportation engineering-related courses.  The laboratory                    
              project improves existing hardware and software systems to                     
              introduce laboratory experiments in traffic engineering and                    
              airport planning and design courses, and in an introductory                    
              course in transportation engineering.  The instrumentation                     
              added to the project includes off-the-roadway sensors,                         
              intersection shelf counters, a central CPU, and data                           
              acquisition hardware and software.  This laboratory will be                    
              used also as a monitoring center capable of replicating some of                
              the primary functions of an intelligent vehicle highway system.
