Abstract    :
                    The project focuses on re-structuring the laboratories in                
              Field Natural History, a sophomore-level course for both majors                
              and non-majors, around the production of natural history                       
              videos.  Using high-quality 8mm camcorders, pairs of students                  
              will tape footage on a topic of their choice (e.g., spider web                 
              architecture or acorn foraging by squirrels and jays).  In                     
              addition to standard filming in the field, they will have the                  
              ability to incorporate videomicroscopy, time lapse, and slow                   
              motion footage.  The students will do the library research                     
              necessary to produce a tight outline and intelligent script.                   
              They will then use a professional editing system to turn their                 
              raw footage into a narrated documentary of 10-20 minutes                       
              length.  The course will end with a film festival, open to the                 
              College community.This project will reinforce young women's                    
              excitement about science, and build confidence in their ability                
              to work independently, think originally, and value their own                   
              observations.
