Abstract    :
              The ABIL is designed to fulfill the needs of five laboratory                   
              courses (Biological Instrumentation, Cell and Molecular                        
              Biology, Comparative Genetics, Microbial Physiology, and an                    
              independent study course) offered within the School of                         
              Biological Sciences.   A flexible seven week modular schedule                  
              running throughout the year provides the necessary access to                   
              the equipment for each of the courses.  The ABIL prepares                      
              students for careers in biological sciences by improving their                 
              abilities to use biological instrumentation and to understand                  
              techniques inherent to modern biological research.  The most                   
              unique feature of these courses is the Biological Equipment                    
              course which requires students to design, build and analyze                    
              different circuits and instruments using prototype boards.                     
              Students disassemble salvaged instruments to understand their                  
              design.
