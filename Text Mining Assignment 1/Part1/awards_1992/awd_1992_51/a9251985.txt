Abstract    :
              Much of current pedagogy in computer science instruction is                    
              static and interactive.  Books use illustrations, charts, and                  
              diagrams - nondynamic, still shots.  Overheads used in class                   
              suffer from the same problem.  Good discussions in the                         
              classroom are appropriately interactive for at least some                      
              students but labor with the limitations of language.  Films or                 
              videos, on the other hand, are dynamic but not usually                         
              interactive.  In part inspired by ideas generated by Project                   
              Kaleidoscope in Washington, DC, the goal of this project is the                
              development of a laboratory for graphical/interactive computer                 
              science instruction and support materials for the classroom.                   
              Utilizing special authoring software, courseware willl be                      
              developed for the laboratory for use in courses in problem                     
              solving, algorithms, data structures, theory of computation,                   
              computer organization, and others.
