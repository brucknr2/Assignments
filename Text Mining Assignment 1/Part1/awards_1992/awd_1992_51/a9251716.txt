Abstract    :
              This project will establish a parallel processing laboratory to                
              provide undergraduate students with the hands-on experience of                 
              programming in a parallel environment and to increase their                    
              understanding of the theoretical aspects of parallel computing                 
              through implementation and experimentation.  Projects are being                
              created to expose the students to such issues as the                           
              coordination and synchronization of parallel processes,                        
              resource management, load balancing, and the related costs and                 
              tradeoffs of various architectural models and algorithmic                      
              techniques.  The laboratory will consist of a transputer-based,                
              multi-user parallel processing system.  This system will be                    
              comprised of 64 transputers connected to six PCs.  A                           
              transputer-based system will permit the various architectural                  
              topologies to be studied, since the interconnection structure                  
              of the transputers can be configured to implement networks such                
              as rings, meshes, trees, toroids, and HyperCubes.  OCCAM, a                    
              parallel-programming language designed specifically for use                    
              with transputers, will be utilized by the students to implement                
              course projects.  In addition, the C programming language will                 
              also be available for use in independent studies and                           
              undergraduate research opportunities.
