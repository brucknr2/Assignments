Abstract    :
              The project will introduce several significant bioanalytical                   
              separations into the interdepartmental undergraduate                           
              biochemistry laboratory experience.  At present, students are                  
              separating biomolecules using classical methods such as thin                   
              layer chromatography, polyacrylamide and agarose gel                           
              electrophoresis, and ion exchange resins.  These methods are                   
              useful in illustration of the separation principles; however,                  
              the results are, at best, qualitative.  A technology has been                  
              identified, high performance capillary electrophoresis (HPCE),                 
              which appears to have the versatility, quickness, and                          
              simplicity required for  integration into five of our existing                 
              experiments that focus on separation, identification, and                      
              quantitation of amino acids, proteins, and nucleic acids.                      
              Faculty-supervised undergraduate research projects in                          
              biochemistry, biology, and chemistry will also employ the HPCE                 
              system.
