Abstract    :
              This project develops a soils science and technology course and                
              incorporates soils testing equipment in the materials testing                  
              laboratory for its laboratory component.  The course is part of                
              the Construction Management Technology program of the                          
              University of Maryland Eastern Shore, and introduces students                  
              to the nature of soils and illustrates how soil materials may                  
              influence certain construction operations.  The course is                      
              divided into two parts.  Part I is an introduction to soil                     
              materials in conjunction with the testing methods, and seven                   
              experiments are performed.  The tests follow closely the ASTM                  
              or AASHTO standard test procedures.  Part II deals with                        
              earthwork in the construction contract and reviews construction                
              items that involve soils operation.
