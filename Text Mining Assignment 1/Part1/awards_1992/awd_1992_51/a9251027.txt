Abstract    :
              Cells and Development, a new course, introduces students to a                  
              problem-solving approach while emphasizing molecular techniques                
              for analysis of growth, differentiation, and morphogenesis.                    
              Student laboratories include DNA analysis, recombinant DNA                     
              techniques, protein analysis techniques, and cell and tissue                   
              culture methods; all topics related to lecture material.  Many                 
              of the laboratory exercises challenge students with a problem                  
              and then require design of an experimental strategy to answer                  
              the questions developed.  Equipment for this laboratory                        
              includes a spectrophotometer, shaking water bath, tabletop                     
              centrifuge, microcentrifuge, laminar flow hood, inverted                       
              microscope, tissue culture incubator, temperature cycler, and                  
              10 electrophoresis systems (1 for each student pair).  The                     
              unique features of this course are the extensive class                         
              discussions of experimental design and of student results.
