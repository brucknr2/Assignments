Abstract    :
              This project adds a hands-on laboratory component to an                        
              environmental assessments course taken by ecology majors and                   
              some education majors, thus improving student knowledge of                     
              techniques and problems in monitoring and assessing                            
              environmental issues.  The students are largely Alaskan                        
              natives, many of whom become elementary teachers in rural                      
              Alaska.  The course emphasizes the  study of the local                         
              environment. The equipment added includes: a portable and a                    
              stationary gas chromatograph (GOW/MAC), ion analyzer                           
              electrodes, an electronic balance, a water purification system                 
              (Millipore), a benchtop sterilizer (Barnstead), and 8 each                     
              stereo and compound microscopes.  The laboratories are designed                
              to help students develop competency in environmental monitoring                
              and sampling, laboratory analysis of samples, the use of                       
              descriptive and inferential statistics and report generation.                  
              Projects include: 1) Analysis of water for a) bacteriologic                    
              contamination, b)  dissolved oxygen and biological oxygen                      
              demand, c) nutrients such as ammonia and nitrates; 2) Analysis                 
              of water and land habitats for community structure, species                    
              diversity and indicator species, and 3) Monitoring of air                      
              quality for noxious gases (NO2, SO2, NO, CO) and particulates.
