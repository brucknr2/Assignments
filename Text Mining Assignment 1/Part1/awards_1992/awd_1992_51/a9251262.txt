Abstract    :
              As part of the continuing development of its nationally                        
              recognized Workshop Physics program, the Department of Physics                 
              and Astronomy at Dickinson College is replacing Macintosh SE                   
              computers located in two introductory physics laboratories with                
              Macintosh IIsi computers and color monitors which are linked by                
              Ethernet to a file server, laser printers, and two video                       
              analysis stations already developed at Dickinson.  This                        
              equipment is being used intensively by both introductory                       
              physics students in the Workshop Physics courses and upperclass                
              physics majors.  It is also being used by other groups at                      
              various levels: non-science students taking freshman seminars                  
              and other required science courses in the department; college                  
              and university teachers attending NSF sponsored summer                         
              workshops; minority high school students; high school girls                    
              visiting for a science career day; and local citizens learning                 
              to monitor radiation.The upgrade of equipment is occurring for                 
              several reasons.  Our older computers and Apple Talk network,                  
              now in their fifth year of service, lack the memory, disk                      
              storage capacity and speed to allow us to make full use of the                 
              capabilities of new software for spreadsheet modeling, video                   
              analysis, symbolic equation solving, data sharing and                          
              simulations.  Two recent NSF grants allow collaboration between                
              Dickinson College, Tufts University and the University of                      
              Oregon for laboratory curriculum development aimed at helping                  
              other institutions make use of integrated computer tools and                   
              interactive teaching methods.  The work of these projects is                   
              being greatly enhanced by the availability of state-of-the art                 
              laboratory computer tools for the development and classroom                    
              testing of curricular materials.
