Abstract    :
              A central equipment facility containing spectrophotometers,                    
              gradient makers, gas liquid and high pressure liquid                           
              chromatography has been established.  Experiments in the first                 
              two classes targeted for using it (Experimental Techniques and                 
              Physiological Ecology) encourage student designed projects with                
              close faculty supervision.  Emphasis is on relating an                         
              organism's behaviorial and adaptive characteristics with                       
              physiological and biochemical parameters.
