Abstract    :
              Students' ability to record, analyze and present biochemical                   
              and physiological measurements is improved through the use of                  
              eight computer data acquisition systems: each consisting of a                  
              computer, a printer, hardware and software for data                            
              acquisition, transducers for the measurement of five                           
              physiological variables, and software for analysis and graphing                
              of data.  Six of these systems are in the mammalian physiology                 
              laboratory and two are in the laboratory of cell biology.  The                 
              units are also available for projects in undergraduate                         
              research, allowing the conduct of experiments and the analysis                 
              and presentation of results to be more quantitative and                        
              meaningful.
