Abstract    :
              The project is establishing a calculus computing laboratory of                 
              30 microcomputers using the software package Mathematica.  This                
              laboratory is being integrated into the curriculum by replacing                
              portions of traditional calculus courses with modules written                  
              in the form of Mathematica notebooks.  Mathematica notebooks                   
              are electronic text in which all calculations and graphics are                 
              alive and may be modified and re-executed.  At least one class                 
              per week is being held in the calculus laboratory where                        
              students use Mathematica as a central tool in learning                         
              calculus.  The curriculum is being modified to reflect the new                 
              approaches to calculus as a result of the graphics, computer                   
              algebra, and programming capabilities of Mathematica.  This                    
              project creates a new generation of calculus labs where the                    
              emphasis is moved from working traditional homework problems                   
              and small projects to the understanding of calculus itself.                    
              The result is classes that attract and hold students' attention                
              by exciting students and allowing them to explore Mathematics                  
              in ways not previously possible.
