Abstract    :
              The Department of Geology is purchasing an automated x-ray                     
              diffraction system for use in to solving geologic problems and                 
              by the Department of Chemistry for the identification of                       
              transition metal complexs.  Students in mineralogy courses are                 
              using the equipment to analyze and characterize mineral                        
              unknown. Using existing clay mineral preparation facilities,                   
              students prepare oriented mounts for clay mineral analysis.                    
              Additionally, students undertaking honors and special studies                  
              research projects are using the instrument.
