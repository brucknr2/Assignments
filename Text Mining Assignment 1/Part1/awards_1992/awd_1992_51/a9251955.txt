Abstract    :
              The goal of this project is to improve mathematics instruction                 
              for preservice and inservice mathematics teachers by utilizing                 
              a networked computer laboratory.  By focusing on teaching                      
              mathematical content using interactive computer technology, the                
              project is preparing teachers to effectively teach mathematical                
              concepts using technology as they enter the classrooms of the                  
              future.  Interactive computer technology provides a powerful                   
              way to depart from the traditional lecture mode and challenges                 
              students to work cooperatively and individually to develop                     
              mathematical concepts, to make generalizations, and to solve                   
              problems.  The computer is helping students develop the ideas                  
              of geometry, algebra, probability, and statistics inductively                  
              as they are led to generalize concepts and solve problems                      
              efficiently.  By coupling interactive computer technology with                 
              cooperative learning in this project, they are enhancing the                   
              mathematics learning of elementary and secondary mathematics                   
              students and the students they teach in the future.
