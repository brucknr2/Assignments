Abstract    :
              This project will allow undergraduate political science majors                 
              at Grambling regular access to a data analysis and computer lab                
              for use in conjunction with statistics and research methods                    
              courses to enhance data collection and analysis skills,                        
              computer skills and general analytic skills for the minority                   
              undergraduate student body (the student body at Grambling is                   
              nearly 98%  African-American).  The statistics and research                    
              methods sequence, which figures prominently in this project,                   
              will feature the hands-on development of small manageable                      
              datasets (students are encouraged to collect primary datasets                  
              in the areas of political behavior, national political                         
              institutions, or public administration from sources readily                    
              available on campus or nearby), the preparation of the data for                
              analysis and all other steps necessary for correctly evaluating                
              data.  Utilization of Exploratory Data Analysis techniques will                
              allow students maximum flexibility in their analyses.
