Abstract    :
              The Department of Chemistry is purchasing an FT-NMR with                       
              multinuclear and variable temperature capabilities for use                     
              throughout the undergraduate program.  The theory and practice                 
              of NMR starts with the first course in organic chemistry and                   
              continues into upper-level courses in instrumental analysis,                   
              advanced inorganic and physical chemistry.  Students enrolled                  
              in these courses are using the instrument to determine the                     
              structures of compounds prepared and isolated in very small                    
              quantities, to measure the rates of fast reactions (millisecond                
              intermediate lifetimes), rotational barriers, and the                          
              characterization of organometallic compounds.  The instrument                  
              is also being used extensively by students undertaking                         
              individual research investigations.
