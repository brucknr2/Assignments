Abstract    :
              This project proposes will develop a laboratory component for                  
              a popular biology course for non-science majors, Natural                       
              History of Alaska.  This course serves 180 students per year                   
              and has a high enrollment of Alaskan Natives (15-20%) and pre-                 
              service teachers (15-20%)   The  new laboratory exercises are                  
              designed as explorations into the natural world.  Students are                 
              encouraged to observe, question, design their own studies, and                 
              present findings orally and in writing.  The laboratory                        
              component will set the agenda for the lecture portion of the                   
              course.  Plant community ecology, plant/herbivore interactions,                
              stream and lake ecology, adaptations for living in the cold,                   
              population dynamics, and parasite/host relations are among the                 
              topics students will explore.
