Abstract    :
              This project is to upgrade and enhance the current IC                          
              laboratory course for both undergraduates and graduate                         
              students.  The university and several industrial sponsors have                 
              provided support for the current laboratory in the form of                     
              personnel and donated equipment.  All the equipment required to                
              fabricate metal gate CMOS circuits is available; however, the                  
              industry technology has migrated from metal-gate to silicon-                   
              gate CMOS technology.  The equipment to be acquired through                    
              this funding will allow the transition to this new technology                  
              and is currently not available as donated items, but essential                 
              for the planned upgrade.
