Abstract    :
              The power systems curriculum at the North Carolina A&T State                   
              University is being updated, infusing more computer and control                
              systems applications into the program.  In line with this                      
              scheduled update, the undergraduate power laboratory is being                  
              upgraded in three phases - the digital application phase (1991-                
              1993), the control application phase (1993 - 1995), and the                    
              replacement of current old equipment phase.  In this project,                  
              focusing on the first phase, personal computers are being                      
              introduced into the undergraduate power laboratory.  The                       
              present analog meters are being replaced with IEEE-488 standard                
              meters.  The meters are interfaced with the PCs through a data                 
              acquisition board.  The objective of this phase is to introduce                
              the students to the use of computers in power systems                          
              operation.  The laboratory procedures emphasize:  (1)                          
              principles of collection and conversion of analog data to                      
              digital data; (2) programming (and use of standard menu-driven                 
              software) to select, display, or store required data, and                      
              perform simple analysis; and (3) the concept of energy (power                  
              x time) and energy conservation which is not possible with the                 
              present instantaneous data collection process.  In the control                 
              systems application phase, the students will be introduced to                  
              the use of control and digital systems to control power systems                
              elements.
