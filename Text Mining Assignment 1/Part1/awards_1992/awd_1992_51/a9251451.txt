Abstract    :
              This project provides equipment (e.g., computers, programmable                 
              instrumentation, commercial robots, and computer-aided design                  
              packages) to develop the capability to modernize and enhance                   
              the undergraduate laboratories in control and robotics.  A set                 
              of relatively complex experimental test-beds in control and                    
              robotics is being developed.  These experiments will be                        
              developed and utilized as design projects for undergraduate                    
              students.  The primary objectives of the projects are : to                     
              increase the exposure of the students to modern programmable                   
              instrumentation and a PC-based laboratory by increasing the                    
              number of stations; to provide state-of-the-art computer                       
              controlled instrumentation and a set of advanced design                        
              experiments; and to introduce students to CAD software for                     
              analysis and design.
