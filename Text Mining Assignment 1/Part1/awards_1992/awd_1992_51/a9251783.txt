Abstract    :
              The Department of Biological Sciences at Mankato State                         
              University has recognized strengths in microbiology,                           
              environmental science, toxicology, and an emerging program in                  
              biotechnology.  The department is dedicated to providing hands-                
              on training to undergraduate  students. Purchase of a Lachat                   
              Ion Analyzer will enhance interdisciplinary undergraduate                      
              instruction and student research related to the analyses of                    
              constituents such as nutrients (phosphates, nitrogen species),                 
              salts (chlorides, sulfates), trace metals (sodium, calcium),                   
              and other chemistries that are important in growth and                         
              fermentation processes.  This capability will provide a                        
              significant improvement over the typical laboratory exercise by                
              allowing the student to progress beyond data collection and                    
              number generation to data analysis, data interpretation, and                   
              decision making.
