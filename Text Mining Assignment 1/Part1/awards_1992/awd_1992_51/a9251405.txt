Abstract    :
              An integrated computer-assisted learning environment in being                  
              established in the chemistry, mathematics and computer science,                
              and physics departments to encourage development of students'                  
              scientific and mathematical modeling skills, and facility for                  
              transferring concepts and tools between disciplines.  The                      
              primary emphasis is on coordinated development of curriculum                   
              changes and computer exercises designed to develop student                     
              skills in analysis and synthesis of models having multi-                       
              disciplinary applications, and with approaches integrating                     
              symbolic, graphic, and numeric methods.  Derive, Maple and                     
              Mathematica are being incorporated into coursework as a common                 
              technology base for the sciences.  The project employs a wide                  
              area network of PC's organized into three laboratories.                        
              Working cooperatively on this project, the three departments                   
              are developing and implementing the concept of computer-aided                  
              integration of the sciences through common abstraction and                     
              modeling techniques.
