Abstract    :
              This project supplements a current molecular biology course                    
              with a hands-on labortory focusing on experiments that will                    
              lead to undergraduate research projects.  Equipment includes:                  
              horizontal gel electrophoresis (1/student pair, Hoeffer),                      
              photographic materials (Polaroid), a microcentrifuge                           
              (Eppendorf), a benchtop incubator (Precision) and material for                 
              PCR (thermal cycler, vacuum blotter).  Exercises include:                      
              plasmid isolation, restriction mapping, Southern                               
              hybridizations, construction of cDNA libraries, screening                      
              techniques and PCR reactions.  The institution has a high                      
              enrollment of minorities (59% Hispanic).
