Abstract    :
              Plant growth chambers with modern environmental controls will                  
              facilitate changes in the introductory biology curriculum,                     
              permitting an experimental motif whereby all students acquire                  
              research experiences and skills.  Descriptive, observational                   
              lab exercises in botany are being replaced by experiments that                 
              emphasize physiological processes.  Students then become                       
              involved with hypothesis formulation, data collection,                         
              statistical analysis, computer graphing, and report writing.                   
              Such a transformation meets several intertwined goals:  more                   
              engaging biology laboratory experiences, better retention of                   
              science students, heightened student interest in research                      
              careers, and improved research training for undergraduates.                    
              Growth chambers meet an urgent need for reliable environments                  
              in which to place botanical experiments; they also open new                    
              opportunities for experimental manipulations of temperature,                   
              humidity, and light regimes. Courses for introductory students                 
              and several courses for advanced undergraduates (Developmental                 
              Biology, Terrestrial Ecology, Plant Identification) will                       
              improve, and new opportunities will open for independent/team                  
              research projects by undergraduates and, during summers, by                    
              secondary students in the Governor's School for the Sciences.
