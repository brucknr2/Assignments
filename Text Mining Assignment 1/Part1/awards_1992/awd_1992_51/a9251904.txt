Abstract    :
              The project focusses on new ways to enhance the teaching of                    
              Research Methods in Psychology.  This course develops skills in                
              critical thinking, applied problem solving, and the ability to                 
              collect, analyze, and summarize data.  Computers facilitate                    
              this training by reducing the time required for setting up                     
              experiments and testing new hypotheses.  A workstation with                    
              video projection capabilities will enable the instructor to                    
              present classroom demonstrations as well as step-by-step                       
              training in the use of software that supports more than 50                     
              different experiments.  This project is unusually cost-                        
              effective because the university already provides a laptop                     
              computer to every student.  The software that students learn                   
              about in the classroom is installed on their own computers,                    
              effectively resulting in a private workstation for each student                
              This enables the students to design experiments that can be                    
              conducted in the dormitories, campus centers, or the field.
