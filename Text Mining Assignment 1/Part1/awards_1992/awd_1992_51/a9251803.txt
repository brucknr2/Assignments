Abstract    :
              The aim of the Experimental Health Psychology Laboratory                       
              project is to provide undergraduates with the opportunity to                   
              investigate interactions among various factors implicated in                   
              the etiology and progression of disease and in the promotion of                
              health. The laboratory equipment includes a carbon monoxide                    
              analyzer, a breath alcohol analyzer, an accelerometer-based                    
              physical activity monitor, an ambulatory blood pressure and                    
              heart rate monitor, and a personal computer for data retrieval.                
              Behavioral risk factors including cigarette smoking, alcohol                   
              intake, and sedentary lifestyle are known to contribute to the                 
              development of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality in                
              the United States.  This laboratory will give students the                     
              chance to design and implement experiments that will explore                   
              interactions among psychological, behavioral, and physiological                
              factors that may contribute to the development of disease.                     
              Undergraduate training in Health Psychology is becoming                        
              increasingly common, but the incorporation of extensive                        
              laboratory experience in this training has not been previously                 
              reported.
