Abstract    :
              The objective of this project is to create a digital                           
              communications laboratory to train undergraduate students in                   
              the design, construction, and testing of digital communications                
              equipment in the one-three GHz frequency range.  The laboratory                
              includes a signal generator, spectrum analyzer, network                        
              analyzer, and receiver for this frequency range, as well as a                  
              workstation with computer aided design software tools for                      
              simulating circuit behavior at microwave frequencies and                       
              generating graphical output for etching microstrip circuit                     
              boards.  A coordinated series of new exercises is being                        
              integrated into existing electromagnetics and communications                   
              laboratories.  Using the equipment, students also conduct                      
              undergraduate research projects sponsored by the Alaska Space                  
              Grant Program.
