Abstract    :
              Nearly every subdiscipline in biology is currently using                       
              recombinant DNA technology as a research tool.  With the advent                
              of this important technology, it is critical that both biology                 
              major and non-major undergraduate students gain laboratory                     
              experiences in this technology.  The goal of this project is to                
              introduce students to basic recombinant DNA laboratory                         
              experiences beginning in the General Biology Course employing                  
              a set of  bacterial recombination exercises.  The recombinant                  
              DNA experiences will continue in Cell Physiology where the                     
              students will isolate plasmid DNA, perform restriction enzyme                  
              analyses, ligate DNA inserts, and perform transformation                       
              assays.   Completion of an original research project is                        
              required of all Biology senior students.  The new equipment                    
              will allow students to participate in a wider variety of                       
              projects  In addition, acquisition of the requested equipment                  
              will allow the development and presentation of a new course in                 
              molecular biology.
