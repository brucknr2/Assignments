Abstract    :
              This project is for the development of an undergraduate                        
              laboratory in fluid mechanics to support the Mechanical                        
              Engineering Program.  The grant provides the financial                         
              resources in order to purchase the following equipment:  (1)                   
              wind tunnels with manometer packages, probe packages and                       
              accessories to investigate Bernoulli's equation, and laminar                   
              and turbulent boundary layers; (2) NACA0020 airfoil sections                   
              with nineteen pressure taps to investigate the stalling angle                  
              of airfoils;  (3) hydraulic benches and accessories to be used                 
              to analyze venturi meters, flows through several different                     
              orifices, the impact of water jets; (4) piping systems with                    
              several different pipes and valves to calculate the energy                     
              losses present in such systems; (5) Reynolds number apparatuses                
              to visualize laminar, transition, and turbulent flows; and (6)                 
              open water channels with accessories to investigate the                        
              hydraulic jump, flows over straight and vee notch weirs, and                   
              visualize flows around simple geometrical objects.  The                        
              laboratory will be an integral part of the MECE 3315 Fluid                     
              Mechanics course which is required for all mechanical                          
              engineering majors.  The laboratory illustrates the concepts                   
              covered in class.  Its main emphasis and effort is placed on                   
              gaining information from the experiments, experiencing the                     
              trials and tribulations of experimentation and not simply                      
              demonstrating physical principles.
