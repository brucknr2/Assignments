Abstract    :
              Computing has experienced two major paradigm shifts in the past                
              25 years:  from batch computing to time-shared computing and                   
              from time-shared computing to personal computer and workstation                
              computing.  A third paradigm shift, probably as significant as                 
              the first two--the exploitation of three-dimensional                           
              visualization, visual programming, and multimedia--will be                     
              next.In this project, Brown University plans to continue to                    
              exert leadership in teaching and research by being at the                      
              forefront of efforts to make this latest paradigm accessible                   
              and useful to all.  The project involves equipping the                         
              electronic classroom with the latest generation of workstations                
              with three-dimensional graphics and multimedia capabilities,                   
              developing the necessary educational software to exploit the                   
              capabilities of this new generation, and exporting both the                    
              software and the educational materials developed with it to                    
              other institutions.The work is both a continuation and a                       
              significant extension of the past and current efforts at Brown.                
              The current research efforts in graphics, programming                          
              environments, and program visualization will be used as a                      
              foundation for the new tools, migrating research software into                 
              the instructional environment. The curriculum will be upgraded                 
              and, where necessary, revised to introduce advanced concepts in                
              the introductory courses and to reinforce these concepts in the                
              latter courses.
