Abstract    :
              The development of a computer-based statistics laboratory to                   
              support an instructional program  will allow students to                       
              actively learn statistical reasoning skills.  The objective is                 
              to improve the education of students in three areas crucial for                
              statistical reasoning:  (1) the conceptual basis for                           
              statistical reasoning and analysis;  (2) why statistics are a                  
              necessary part of the research process;  and (3) the impact of                 
              practical decisions on statistical outcomes.  The laboratory                   
              will serve ten psychology courses, including Research Methods,                 
              Statistics for the Behavioral Sciences, and eight upper-level                  
              Topical Research courses.   The learning activities supported                  
              by the laboratory are based upon Maple, a computer algebra                     
              system, and SPSSx, a computer statistics package.  Maple will                  
              help address the first two objectives by creating a dynamic                    
              learning environment in which abstract statistical concepts are                
              represented visually.  SPSSx will help address the third                       
              objective by providing regular occasions for instructors to                    
              help students understand how the characteristics of                            
              psychological research affect the results of statistical                       
              analyses.
