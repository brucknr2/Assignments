Abstract    :
              A 200 MHz Fourier transform nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)                   
              spectrometer will be incorporated into nine undergraduate                      
              laboratory courses.  These include courses in organic,                         
              physical, analytical, and biological chemistry.  Experiments                   
              will include compound identification, kinetics, thermodynamics,                
              and various two-dimensional techniques.  The project will                      
              affect not only chemistry majors, but also                                     
              biology/microbiology, pre-medical, pre-veterinary, pre-                        
              pharmacy, and pre-chiropractic students.  Students will become                 
              proficient in hands-on use of an important experimental                        
              technique and will learn much about computer-controlled                        
              instrumentation and signal processing.
