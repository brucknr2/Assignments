Abstract    :
              The main goal of this project is to improve the learning,                      
              retention, and application of physics concepts and principles                  
              by students enrolled in physics classes at Lee College.  This                  
              is being accomplished by introducing a series of new                           
              experiences in the laboratory utilizing microcomputer-based                    
              laboratories, activities, and new experiments in mechanics.                    
              These laboratory experiences are in the areas of kinematics,                   
              forces, rotational motion, energy, and simple harmonic motion.                 
              Using some of the MBL results of Thornton and Laws with some                   
              results done at Lee College, a new laboratory curriculum is                    
              being developed that is integrating new technologies with                      
              proven activities and experiments.  Microcomputers are being                   
              used to perform data collection, analysis, and graphing; and                   
              are being used to construct, execute, and display physical                     
              simulations in mechanics.The support is provided for software                  
              and hardware for six, networked, color Macintosh IIsi                          
              workstations equipped with a Universal Lab Interface with                      
              appropriate sensors and probes. Support is also provided for a                 
              laser printer, CD reader, scanner, and some laboratory                         
              equipment.This project is encouraging students to continue                     
              study in physics or to support science by improving their                      
              experiences in physics, to increase science literacy, to help                  
              prepare Lee College's physics courses for the next century, and                
              to stimulate other two-year and four-year colleges to adapt                    
              this approach for their needs.
