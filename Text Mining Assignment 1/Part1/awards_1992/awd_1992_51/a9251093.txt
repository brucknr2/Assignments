Abstract    :
              A multidisciplinary laboratory program is being developed                      
              making use of Geographic Information Systems equipment.                        
              Students in geology, geography, and in plant and earth sciences                
              are making use of spatial data bases as a part of their                        
              disciplinary coursework. As a part of the program connections                  
              are being made among such areas as cartography, land use,                      
              wildlife management, geology, and ecological resource                          
              inventory.
