Abstract    :
              This project provides undergraduate aerospace engineering                      
              students in design courses the means rapidly to manufacture                    
              accurate prototypes or scale models of parts they have                         
              designed, without recourse to skilled labor and well within the                
              time constraints of a one semester course.  To do so, the                      
              University employs an apparatus (Stereolithographic press )                    
              which can use a CAD solid modeler database, already generated                  
              by students in the process of finalizing their designs, to                     
              produce prototypes as three-dimensional plastic solids.  Three-                
              dimensional printing (stereolithography) is safe, dependable,                  
              state-of-the-art technology, well beyond the development stage,                
              and already coming into wide use in industry.  This project                    
              represents a pioneering  use of this new technology, embodied                  
              in a commercially available apparatus, as a tool to bring the                  
              issue of producibility into the educational experience of                      
              engineering graduates.  The project is significant because it                  
              addresses the urgent national need to strengthen the design and                
              manufacturing content of undergraduate engineering curricula                   
              while providing the crucial linkage between those two important                
              aspects of production.
