Abstract    :
              The Department of Chemistry is purchasing a Fourier Transform                  
              infrared spectrometer for use in several lower division                        
              chemistry courses.   This includes courses for both majors and                 
              non-majors. In the Chemistry for Non-Scientists course,                        
              students examine  functional groups in commercial polymer                      
              films.  In the general chemistry course, measurements are made                 
              of the spectra of various oxygen, carbon, and nitrogen groups.                 
              In organic chemistry, Friedel-Crafts acylations are performed.                 
              In the analytical chemistry course, students identify the                      
              components of the gas phase mixture that forms above                           
              concentrated nitric acid, and also conduct an experiment to                    
              determine trace analytes.
