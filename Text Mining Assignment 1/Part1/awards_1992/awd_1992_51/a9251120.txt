Abstract    :
              The Department of Chemistry is purchasing equipment for                        
              electrochemical and magnetic studies in support of the                         
              development of an inorganic laboratory course and revision of                  
              an instrumental analysis course.  The instruments are being                    
              used to investigate the relationships between the oxidation                    
              state of metals and the rates of electron transfer reactions,                  
              acidity of ligands, absorbtion spectra, and magnetic                           
              properties.  Undergraduate students engaging in independent                    
              research projects are also making extensive use of the                         
              instruments.In the laboratory component of instrumental                        
              analysis, the training of our students in electrochemistry will                
              be improved.  In this fundamental area of chemistry standard                   
              experiments involving polarographic and stripping voltammetric                 
              techniques will be introduced.  Major equipment includes a                     
              polarographic analyzer and stripping voltammeter.  The basic                   
              foundations of electrochemistry developed in instrumental                      
              analysis will help to understand the electrochemical techniques                
              involved in the advanced inorganic laboratory.
