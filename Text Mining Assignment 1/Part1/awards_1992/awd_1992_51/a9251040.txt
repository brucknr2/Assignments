Abstract    :
              Over the past 15 years a radiation training laboratory and                     
              program has been established and equipped through NSF Grants,                  
              local school support and industry donations.  St. Mary's                       
              College has become a center of excellence in the training of                   
              radiation scientists.  This project fills important gaps in the                
              program's instrumentation so that students can be properly                     
              prepared to enter the modern industrial and academic research                  
              laboratories.  Many modern scientific instruments are now                      
              computer based, one central processing personal computer runs                  
              several different instruments which are purchased as plug-in                   
              boards.  Operating instruments from a computer terminal is a                   
              fact of life in the scientific laboratory of today.  This                      
              method is rapidly replacing the dedicated instrument.  The                     
              computer based Multichannel Analyzer will give students this                   
              important experience as well as strengthen their laboratory                    
              training in many aspects of the radiation sciences.Various                     
              radiation detectors update the collection of detectors and                     
              allow students to do interesting new experiments.  The use of                  
              high quality, up-to-date scientific instruments has proven a                   
              great motivational factor for students. Their sense of                         
              confidence is greatly boosted by these experiences and their                   
              interest in pursuing graduate studies has been enhanced.  About                
              60% of the physics majors and minors go on for graduate                        
              studies.
