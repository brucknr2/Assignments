Abstract    :
              The capstone experience to the Applied Mathematics                             
              Undergraduate Program is concentrated in a mathematics modeling                
              course, requiring prerequisite materials in computer                           
              programming, differential equations, linear algebra, and                       
              mathematical statistics, followed by senior project courses.                   
              In these project courses an industrial environment is                          
              simulated, attempting to give students the best possible                       
              environment for professional positions as applied                              
              mathematicians.  This project is updating the existing                         
              laboratory resources with four high performance IBM-compatible                 
              PCs, 80486 based, and two SUN SPARCstation machines, including                 
              common industrial mathematics software.  This enhancement to                   
              the computer laboratory is allowing the institution to                         
              incorporate intense, realistic computational assignments as                    
              part of the capstone experience in undergraduate applied                       
              mathematics.
