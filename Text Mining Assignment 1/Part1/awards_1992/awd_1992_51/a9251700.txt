Abstract    :
              A computer integrated manufacturing (CIM) project utilizes                     
              hierarchical computer control in a junior-level                                
              laboratory/lecture course environment at the GMI Engineering                   
              and Management Institute.  The laboratory allows students the                  
              opportunity to integrate the knowledge taught separately in the                
              design, manufacturing, and business courses of a CIM                           
              environment.  Students experiment while learning and                           
              integrating five levels of communication hierarchical                          
              (facility, shop, cell, station, and equipment) control.  The                   
              project utilizes a SUN SPARCstation-2 networked to four SUN IPX                
              SPARCstations which in turn are connected each to a PUMA 260                   
              robot and an DENFORD NC machine.  This equipment and a closed                  
              loop conveyor system for material handling and a protective                    
              light fence - for safety - are located in the existing CIM                     
              Laboratory.  While the laboratory is central to the GMI CIM                    
              course, Robotics and NC Systems lecture and laboratory courses                 
              also benefit from it.  Experiences from the project will be                    
              reported in professional and educational journal.
