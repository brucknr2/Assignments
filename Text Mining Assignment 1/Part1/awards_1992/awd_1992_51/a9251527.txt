Abstract    :
              The Department of Geology is purchasing equipment to support                   
              field work in hydrology.  The equipment is enabling advanced                   
              students to undertake the extensive field work required in                     
              modern hydrology studies and integrate the results of field                    
              work with existing data from the region.  A strong research                    
              approach to teaching hydrological principles and procedures is                 
              incorporated into all upper division groundwater and hydrology                 
              courses.
