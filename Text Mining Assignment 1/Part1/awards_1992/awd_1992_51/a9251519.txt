Abstract    :
              Non-technical majors are introduced to the process of                          
              scientific investigation and the principles common to living                   
              systems.  The four broad topic areas introduced are: Scientific                
              Methodologies; Molecular and Cellular Biology; Organismal                      
              Physiology; and Heredity, Ecology and Evolution. Organisms                     
              investigated include: termites (observation of behavior),                      
              potatoes (determining chemical content), Vibrio natriegens                     
              (bacterial growth curves), and a comparison of F- and F+ E.                    
              coli (a study of conjugation).  Development of students'                       
              observational skills and appreciation for inquiry are                          
              emphasized.
