Abstract    :
              The Department of Chemistry is acquiring instrumentation to                    
              institute a novel series of independent study courses on                       
              practical instrumental analysis.  Under this scheme teams of                   
              students, consisting of freshman through seniors are providing                 
              analytical expertise to the department, University and, some                   
              members of the surrounding community.  The approach stresses                   
              team-oriented problem solving with instruments and the                         
              development of the skills necessary to select the appropriate                  
              analytical method/technique as well as gaining expertise with                  
              the instruments.
