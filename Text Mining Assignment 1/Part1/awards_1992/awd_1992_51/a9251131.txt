Abstract    :
              The Department of Physical Sciences is acquiring a computerized                
              meteorological ground station consisting of a GOES equipment                   
              package with NOAA and super NOAA upgrades that receives RF                     
              (radio frequency) satellite signals from GOES satellites and                   
              supporting computers.  The weather satellite station serves as                 
              a particularly strong tool for clarifying scientific concepts                  
              to  non-science students by making it possible for them to                     
              conduct experiments that are directly related to their everyday                
              activities.  For example, students are predicting local weather                
              and comparing their predictions to those of the weather service                
              and the actual weather conditions.
