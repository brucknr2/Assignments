Abstract    :
              Education in the design of very large scale integrated (VLSI)                  
              digital circuits has reached a stage where undergraduate                       
              students in U.S. universities are routinely able to                            
              successfully design sophisticated circuits.  The education of                  
              this same group of students in analog VLSI design principles is                
              not at the same level of maturity due to factors such as the                   
              extra degrees of freedom involved in the analog design process.                
              The increased complexity of analog VLSI design seriously                       
              interferes with the closure of the design test loop that is an                 
              important part of the digital VLSI educational process.  This                  
              project offers a means to provide closure to this design-test                  
              loop in analog VLSI design by providing educators a laboratory                 
              style tutorial manual with accompanying VLSI circuit chip set                  
              that covers many important topics in analog design.  This                      
              Analog CMOS VLSI Design Resource Kit will allow microsystems                   
              educators the ability to cover important analog design concepts                
              in lecture and then immediately assign laboratory assignments                  
              based on this material.  The resource kit, including chip set,                 
              will be designed to be completely accessible via INTERNET.  The                
              chip set will be designed so that fabrication may be handled by                
              the NSF-supported fabrication service MOSIS.  Dissemination of                 
              the resource kit will be aided by the Massachusetts                            
              Microelectronics Center.
