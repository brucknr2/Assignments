Abstract    :
              Automated methods of processing geographic data is typically                   
              introduced in the undergraduate curriculum after manual methods                
              of map design, construction analysis are taught.  This project                 
              will provide the fundamental computer processing equipment for                 
              introducing automated drafting and analysis of maps and image                  
              interpretation methods in both introductory and advanced                       
              geographic methods courses, and offer an environment for                       
              stimulating student creativity in exploiting automated                         
              processing and display methods.  Introducing automated methods                 
              of designing and drafting maps and analyzing geographic data in                
              introductory cartography and aerial photo interpretation                       
              courses is a radical departure from the traditional first stage                
              instruction using manual methods. A novel feature of the                       
              project involves independent student research projects that                    
              specifically focus on the development of software for use in                   
              several other laboratories.
