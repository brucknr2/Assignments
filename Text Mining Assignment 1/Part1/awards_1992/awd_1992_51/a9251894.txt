Abstract    :
              An undergraduate ergonomics laboratory is being introduced in                  
              the Industrial Engineering department at Marquette University.                 
              Through this experimental training and the electromyographic                   
              measurements carried out in a simulated work environment,                      
              industrial engineering students learn the problems associated                  
              with cumulative trauma disorders. The education of industrial                  
              engineers in this laboratory addresses not only the well-being                 
              of the workers but also the reduction of the costs of                          
              occupational injuries, such as low back pain and cumulative                    
              trauma disorders,  which include the common carpal tunnel                      
              syndrome.  Study of the redesign of the workplace through                      
              ergonomic intervention reduces the incidence of these injuries                 
              and enhances industrial productivity.
