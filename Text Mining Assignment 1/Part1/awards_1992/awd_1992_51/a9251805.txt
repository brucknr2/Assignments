Abstract    :
              This program began the development of an advanced physics lab.                 
              The equipment is being used for experiments, theses, and                       
              student research.  Computer interfacing is being developed for                 
              each laboratory experiment and/or project when feasible.  The                  
              program concentrates on investigations in two specific areas:                  
              wave studies and vacuum studies.  Applications and experiences                 
              for these two areas have been determined to be most needed in                  
              the current curriculum structure.  The flexibility of the                      
              equipment provides opportunities for extended research                         
              investigations in which continuity is being maintained by                      
              faculty involvement.  Institutional commitment, experienced                    
              faculty, and an increased need to develop the students'                        
              experimental abilities strongly suggest success for this                       
              project.
