Abstract    :
              This project will provide students with coherent, integrated,                  
              laboratory experiences that build competence and interest in                   
              scientific psychology.  The proposal is for ten microcomputers,                
              interfaces, and software to complement current educational                     
              strengths in core psychology courses (General Psychology,                      
              Statistics, and Research Methods), our content courses                         
              (Learning, Perception, and Physiological) and our research                     
              courses (Research Seminar and Independent Study).                              
              The computers will foster a programmatic curricular change.                    
              Students will participate in experiments - first as subjects,                  
              then as analysts, then as hypothesis builders, and finally as                  
              experimenters - to acquire the core methodological and                         
              cognitive skills needed for scientific investigations in any                   
              content area of psychology. Conducting empirical investigations                
              and constructing testable, quantitative, models of complex                     
              behaviors will foster students' independence and self                          
              confidence.
