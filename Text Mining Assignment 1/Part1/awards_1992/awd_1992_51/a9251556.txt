Abstract    :
              Five undergraduate courses, which require the knowledge of                     
              single- or multi-phase (involving solid-liquid or gas-liquid)                  
              flow in an open duct or a pipe, are taught at the department of                
              Geology and Geological Engineering of the South Dakota School                  
              of Mines and Technology (SDSM&T).  At present, these courses                   
              are taught with theoretical interpretation and abstract                        
              visualization of the flow process.  This project provides a                    
              single- and multi-phase flow loop for the departmental                         
              undergraduate laboratory that will be used by all five courses.                
              The flow loop will be used for the following applications:  (1)                
              single phase flow experiments with Newtonian and Non-Newtonian                 
              fluids; (2) pressure drop experiments for horizontal well                      
              drilling; (3) pressure drop experiments for gas-oil flow                       
              through horizontal wells and production pipelines; (4) flow                    
              visualization and quantitative analysis under slurry flow                      
              conditions; and (5) flow visualization and quantitative                        
              analysis of fluvial deposition.  The flow loop will also be                    
              used for undergraduate design and research projects.  The                      
              experimental setup will be fully used throughout the summer for                
              conducting undergraduate research.  Moreover, plans are                        
              underway to hold workshops for training regional high school                   
              science teachers.  This will generate interest in petroleum and                
              geological engineering topics through indirect impact on high                  
              school students.
