Abstract    :
              This project will develop the use of infrared spectroscopy in                  
              the chemistry laboratory curriculum at Allegheny College.  The                 
              incorporation of fourier transform infrared techniques is a key                
              element for the success of our new integrated laboratory                       
              program.  Chemistry students will study and use infrared                       
              spectroscopy starting at the introductory level and continuing                 
              through to the senior year.  The speed, resolution, and                        
              computerized data manipulation offered by a fourier transform                  
              infrared are essential.  Specific experiments include                          
              characterization of polymers, of metal complexes, and of                       
              substances generated in an integrated course in synthetic                      
              methods.
