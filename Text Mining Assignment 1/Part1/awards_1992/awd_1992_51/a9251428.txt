Abstract    :
              The Physics Department at Mount Holyoke is expanding and                       
              upgrading experiments for two upper-level physics courses and                  
              one advanced laboratory course, with emphasis on the dramatic                  
              effects of fundamental quantum mechanics.  The new experiments                 
              are:  The Mossbauer Effect and Angular Polarization Correlation                
              of Two Photon Annihilation Radiation (the Einstein, Podolsky                   
              Rosen paradox).  The experiments being upgraded are: Double                    
              Slit Photon Interference and Accelerator-Based Rutherford                      
              Scattering.  These experiments blend well with existing                        
              instrumentation and faculty expertise in the department, and                   
              with the modern physics course structure.  With these                          
              experiments students have opportunities to experimentally                      
              investigate and become intrigued by some of the most                           
              fundamental and counter-intuitive aspects of quantum theory.The                
              major pieces of equipment provided by the grant that are needed                
              to carry out these upgrades include:  1) a high vacuum turbo                   
              pumping system and a PC-based multichannel analyzer, both of                   
              which find many other uses within the Physics Department;  2)                  
              two radioactive sources Na-22 and Co-58;  and 3) some NIM                      
              electronics, the remainder to be supplied by the department.                   
              The turbo pump is being used to improve the Rutherford                         
              Scattering experiment.  The data analysis capability of the PC                 
              is being used in the Mossbauer experiment and in the double                    
              slit photon interference experiment.
