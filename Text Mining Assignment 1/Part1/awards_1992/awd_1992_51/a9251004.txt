Abstract    :
              A quadrupole mass spectrometer (MS) is being used in a range of                
              experiments throughout the undergraduate curriculum.  The                      
              extreme mobility, simplicity of operation, robustness and rapid                
              start-up time of the instrumentation allows students in the                    
              Advanced Freshman Laboratory to determine atomic and molecular                 
              weights.  In the Organic Laboratory students carry out a GC-MS                 
              of their reaction product(s) and interpret a cracking pattern,                 
              while in the Advanced Experimental Laboratory the MS is used                   
              for quantitative analysis and as an exemplar of interfacing.                   
              In the Intermediate Laboratory, which stresses Inorganic                       
              Chemistry, students take the mass spectrum of ferrocene.  Also                 
              being  developed are:  1) simple rapid sampling techniques to                  
              aid teaching/demonstration; 2) a graphics package which                        
              displays the flight of ions through the quadrupole field; and                  
              3) experiments which illustrate simple periodic trends and                     
              bonding properties.
