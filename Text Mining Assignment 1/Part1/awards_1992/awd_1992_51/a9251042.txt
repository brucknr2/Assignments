Abstract    :
              Statistical Computing Laboratory                                               
              Mathematics, engineering, and computer science majors at Tri-                  
              State University are analyzing real-life statistical data                      
              relating to environmental concerns of the area's surrounding                   
              lakes.  By using networked IBM compatible microcomputers and                   
              statistical software, students in the calculus-based                           
              probability and statistics sequence are better understanding                   
              statistical principles and methods.  The project involves                      
              several individual experiments and one group project for each                  
              course.  Each group is presenting their results orally in class                
              and also completing a written report.  While all groups within                 
              the course are working on the same project, individual groups                  
              are presenting different approaches to the problem.  This                      
              experience of analyzing the problem, followed by analyzing the                 
              data, and then applying this procedure to actual environmental                 
              situations is good preparation for college graduates who will                  
              face problem-solving as young professional scientists and                      
              engineers.
