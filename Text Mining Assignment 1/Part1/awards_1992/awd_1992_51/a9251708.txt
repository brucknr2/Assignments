Abstract    :
              The main objective of this project is to improve learning,                     
              retention and application of physics concepts and principles by                
              students enrolled in physics at Blinn College.  This is being                  
              accomplished by using microcomputers, software, interface                      
              measuring modules and video technology to introduce new                        
              experiences in data acquisition and data analysis.  This                       
              technology will provides immediate feedback because of the                     
              speed, number and variety of the trials that can be performed                  
              by the student, thereby promoting a better attitude for science                
              and building more confidence in their scientific ability.                      
                                                                                             
              Support has been used for the establishment and upgrade of                     
              eleven computer workstations.  Each workstation is equipped                    
              with laboratory interfaces, software and appropriate sensors                   
              and probes.  Support was also obtained for software and                        
              videoware which are being used in demonstrations.  This support                
              is revitalizing physics at Blinn College.
