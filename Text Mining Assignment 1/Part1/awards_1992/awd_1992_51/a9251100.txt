Abstract    :
              This project will enhance the practical experience of the                      
              senior undergraduates by providing them with the ability to                    
              perform digital signal processing upon extended segments of                    
              audio data in the laborator                                                    
              y.  Audio data has been chosen because it will permit cost-                    
              effective, real time signal processing.  The availability of                   
              the equipment provided will greatly improve the quality, and                   
              quantity, of the experiments that the students can perform.                    
                                                                                             
              The need to provide an integrated laboratory setup to gather,                  
              store, manipulate, and reproduce extended segments of audio                    
              data has led to the need to purchase a computer system that has                
              all the pieces from the microphone through the computer to the                 
              speaker.  The system selected is based upon a NeXT computer,                   
              together with some ancillary audio hardware.                                   
                                                                                             
              The system will be used to gather audio data from an                           
              experimental setup.  The data can either be processed in real                  
              time, or stored in the computer and processed off-line.                        
              (Processing can be done though both software and the built-in                  
              Digital Signal Processing board.) The data can be played back                  
              to give the students direct feedback as to what effects the                    
              processing had on the audio data.
