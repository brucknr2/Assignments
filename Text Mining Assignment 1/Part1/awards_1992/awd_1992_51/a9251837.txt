Abstract    :
              The Department of Science and Mathematics is acquiring a high-                 
              pressure liquid chromatograph and integrator, a filter-weighing                
              analytical balance, a solvent filtration system with pump, and                 
              three stereo microscopes.  All of these are being used in an                   
              integrated curriculum which will lead to a new Environmental                   
              Sciences degree.  Skills being developed from the use of this                  
              equipment include environmental monitoring as well as chemical                 
              analysis of the resulting air, water and soil samples.                         
              Quantitative skills for separating and chemically analyzing                    
              trace components, as well as field sampling and evaluation of                  
              samples in ecological and microbiological investigations, are                  
              being emphasized in the curriculum.
