Abstract    :
              Molecular biology equipment augmented with computer analysis                   
              capabilities is incorporated into two courses in molecular                     
              biology; one for students preparing for a career in ecology and                
              conservation biology and one for students interested in                        
              biotechnology and health related fields.  The molecular                        
              approach in ecology is an innovative feature of this project;                  
              one which promises to have national impact.  Equipment                         
              includes: centrifuges, chromatography chambers, DNA sequencers                 
              and readers and a fileserver with 8 related workstations.                      
              Techniques introduced include access and use of computer                       
              molecular genetics databases.  Other classes using this                        
              equipment include: the Foundations of Biology Lab, General                     
              Genetics, Human Genetics, Conservation Biology, Fish Ecology,                  
              and Evolutionary Biology.
