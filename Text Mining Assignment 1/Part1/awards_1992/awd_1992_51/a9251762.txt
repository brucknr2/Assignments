Abstract    :
              The aim of the project is the enhancement of the recombinant                   
              DNA lab experience for undergraduate women in the biology                      
              department.  Funds are requested for the purchase of four                      
              instrumentation units to meet the needs of the development                     
              plan:  (1) A DNA thermal cycler will be used to select and                     
              amplify a specific eukaryotic gene from a eukaryotic cDNA                      
              library by polymerase chain reaction (PCR).  (2) A                             
              minifluorimeter will be utilized for accurate DNA concentration                
              determinations.  (3) An electroporation system will allow                      
              efficient transformation of bacteria with cloned DNA in an                     
              expression vector.  (4) A mini electrophoresis system will be                  
              used to perform electrophoresis of proteins and subsequent                     
              Western blotting to detect specific proteins immunologically.
