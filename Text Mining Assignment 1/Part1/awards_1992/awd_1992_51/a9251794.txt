Abstract    :
              The Department of Science and Mathematics is purchasing gas                    
              chromatography equipment and accessories for an atomic                         
              absorption spectrophotometer for use in an upper division                      
              Environmental Chemistry courses for engineers.  Nearly all                     
              engineers are being required to deal with hazardous waste                      
              concerns associated with industrial processing.  The equipment                 
              is enabling students to analyze industrial environmental                       
              samples for organics and inorganics at EPA/OSHA mandated levels                
              and with EPA/ASTM-based methodology and better understand the                  
              capabilities and limitations of the analytical methods                         
              involved.
