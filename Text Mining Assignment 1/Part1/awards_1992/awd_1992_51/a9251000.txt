Abstract    :
              The Department of Earth Sciences is upgrading its meteorology                  
              computer laboratory for undergraduates.  The laboratory is                     
              being used to achieve a full integration of Unidata computer-                  
              based meteorological analysis and display packages into the                    
              introductory, synoptic, weather briefing, climatology and                      
              weather forecasting courses.  The laboratory also makes                        
              possible the development of a new senior level course in                       
              mesometeorology and is enhancing the ability of undergraduates                 
              to engage in independent research studies.
