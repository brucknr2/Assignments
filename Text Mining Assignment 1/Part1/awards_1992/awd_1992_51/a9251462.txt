Abstract    :
              A  Biotechnology Laboratory Specialist Program has been                        
              implemented at Shoreline Community College.  New equipment (DNA                
              electrophoresis equipment, DNA sequencing equipment, and                       
              protein electrophoresis equipment with associated power                        
              supplies, DNA sequencing software with necessary computer                      
              capability) is used in two sophomore-level biotechnology                       
              courses; Molecular Genetics and Recombinant DNA Techniques.                    
              Tissue culture equipment (laminar flow hoods, inverted                         
              microscopes, and liquid nitrogen storage containers) augments                  
              a third sophomore level course; Tissue Culture Techniques.  A                  
              Biotechnology Advisory Committee, composed of representatives                  
              from academia and industry, act as consultants for the program.
