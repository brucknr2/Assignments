Abstract    :
              An advanced sonagraph with accessories including computer                      
              interface establishes an acoustic analysis workstation for use                 
              in undergraduate laboratories and field ecology projects.  The                 
              equipment is used by four components of the biology program: 1)                
              General Zoology (required for biology, environmental science,                  
              secondary and elementary education majors), 2) Animal Behavior                 
              and Vertebrate Zoology, 3) Directed Study and Senior Thesis and                
              4) pooling with other institutions through MEDUSA (Maine                       
              Undergraduate Marine Science Consortium). The PI is                            
              incorporating elements of his NSF funded research directly into                
              the introductory level laboratory. Dissemination will be                       
              through MEDUSA.
