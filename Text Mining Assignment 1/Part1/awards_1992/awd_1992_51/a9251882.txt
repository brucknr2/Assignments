Abstract    :
              The Department of Chemistry is acquiring a flame and graphite                  
              furnace atomic absorption spectrophotometer with automatic                     
              furnace sample changer for use in chemistry  and environmental                 
              science courses.  Students are undertaking trace metal analysis                
              in natural water systems, body fluids, commercial products, and                
              in soils.  The instrument is benefiting a growing undergraduate                
              research program and is being used in summer programs for high                 
              school students and middle school teachers.
