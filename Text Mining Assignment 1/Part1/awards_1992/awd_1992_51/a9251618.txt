Abstract    :
              A laser-based kinetics/spectroscopy laboratory is being created                
              to service students in physical chemistry, instrumental                        
              analysis, and polymer chemistry laboratories and undergraduate                 
              research.  With this equipment, students perform experiments to                
              gain insights into the chemical an physical principles                         
              discussed in lecture courses.  The laboratory houses two                       
              instrumental arrangements, each of which can be easily adapted                 
              to perform a number of experiments.  One utilizes steady-state                 
              excitation to effect Raman scattering, emission spectroscopy,                  
              fluorescence analysis, and light scattering.  This system                      
              includes a 150 mW Argon-ion excitation laser and a detection                   
              system consisting of a monochromator, photomultiplier tube, and                
              either a lock-in amplifier or electrometer.  Data collection is                
              under computer control.  The second arrangement features a                     
              pulsed-nitrogen laser pumped dye laser excitation source that                  
              allows students to measure luminescence lifetimes and perform                  
              pulse-probe experiments.  Detection is accomplished with a                     
              digital oscilloscope.
