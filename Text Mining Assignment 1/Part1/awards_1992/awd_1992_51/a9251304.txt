Abstract    :
              This project establishes a physiology and neuroscience center                  
              for use in a variety of classes.  Class designs stress an                      
              investigative approach: experimental design and data generation                
              in small groups followed by class comparison, discussion, and                  
              compilation of data.  Equipment includes:  the MacLab Virtual                  
              Instrument System interfaced between Thornton Physiological                    
              Systems, and Macintosh Classic II computers.  Elementary and                   
              sophisticated neurophysiological, neurochemical, and                           
              neuroanatomical computer simulations are used as introductions                 
              to actual experiments in laboratory classes and offer students                 
              in non-major classes, and in beginning and advanced level                      
              neuroscience-related classes, opportunities to explore                         
              simulated interactive experiments.
