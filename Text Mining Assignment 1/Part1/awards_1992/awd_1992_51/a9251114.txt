Abstract    :
              Make mathematics courses more relevant|  Use technology                        
              effectively|  Have students learn experientially and                           
              collaboratively|  Throughout the nation these have been clear                  
              and urgent calls.  A course for liberal arts majors (Math 1010)                
              is being developed to address these issues.  This four-                        
              semester-hour course includes a two-hour laboratory each week                  
              in which students learn to solve problems.  They generate data                 
              and have group discussions comparing alternative strategies for                
              solving a problem.  Then they give both written and oral                       
              presentations of their solutions. Computer are used for                        
              graphing data, for doing statistics, for solving linear                        
              programming and financial problems, and then for integrating                   
              all of these into written reports.  Students leave this course                 
              with an appreciation of how mathematics and computers are used                 
              as tools in modeling and problem solving.  The goal is that                    
              eventually 1,000 Appalachian students will take this course per                
              year, and that this course will serve as a model for other                     
              schools.
