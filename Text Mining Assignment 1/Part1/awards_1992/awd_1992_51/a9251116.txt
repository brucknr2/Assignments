Abstract    :
              The Department of Geology is purchasing microscope equipment                   
              for use in a variety of geology courses, undergraduate                         
              research, and lecture demonstrations.  This acquisition                        
              represents a major step in the modernization of the geology                    
              curriculum.  In the economic geology course, microscopic                       
              studies are carried out on a number of ore and mineral samples.                
              In petrology courses, students are able to use the reflective                  
              capabilities of the instrument to study various silicate                       
              systems.  A recent undergraduate research project involved a                   
              study of ore mineralization adjacent to a granitic dike.
