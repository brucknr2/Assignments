Abstract    :
              This proposal requests funds for computer equipment to serve an                
              emerging multimedia curriculum in introductory archaeology and                 
              archaeological method and theory at the University of                          
              California, Santa Barbara. Undergraduate students will be                      
              introduced to the complexities of scientific archaeology, and                  
              to major developments in human prehistory using a Hypercard-                   
              based, interactive set of computer exercises.  An Archaeology                  
              Learning Center with 15 networked microcomputers will be                       
              established that will serve both introductory and upper-                       
              division archaeology courses.  The computer equipment will also                
              assist the Department of Anthropology in disseminating                         
              multimedia materials such as Anthropology 3 to other                           
              institutions across the nation.
