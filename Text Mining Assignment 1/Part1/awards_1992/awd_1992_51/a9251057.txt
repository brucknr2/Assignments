Abstract    :
              A scanning electron microscope (SEM) with an energy dispersive                 
              x-ray microanalysis system is being used to train undergraduate                
              students in upper-level laboratories of biology, chemistry, and                
              geology in the use and application of these instruments.  The                  
              secondary application will be to improve the abilities of                      
              undergraduate students to accomplish independent research on                   
              campus. In addition, the SEM and microanalysis system will be                  
              developed in a way to increase the attraction and retention of                 
              students interested in the science and non-science degree                      
              programs at this four-year, undergraduate, minority                            
              institution.
