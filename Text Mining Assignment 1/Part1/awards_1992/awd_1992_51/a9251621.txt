Abstract    :
              Fiber and integrated optical technologies have witnessed rapid                 
              development over the last decade and are finding extensive                     
              commercial applications in optical communications, sensor                      
              signal processing, and distributed control.  This project will                 
              develop an instructional senior level undergraduate laboratory                 
              providing students with hands-on experience in the design,                     
              fabrication, and testing of integrated optical devices.  The                   
              laboratory will serve as a model which can be easily and                       
              relatively inexpensively emulated by other universities across                 
              the country.
