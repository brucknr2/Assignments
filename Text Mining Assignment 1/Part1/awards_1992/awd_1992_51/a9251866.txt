Abstract    :
              As part of the transition from a quarter to a semester calendar                
              system the Physics Department has designed and is implementing                 
              a new course in experimental physics for incoming students who                 
              are seriously interested in physics.  The purpose of the course                
              is to excite students about experimental science and help them                 
              develop an understanding of how experiments are designed,                      
              assembled and carried out.  The course may attract and retain                  
              more physics majors.  The experiments are based on a relatively                
              limited number of topics which can be investigated                             
              experimentally with a minimum of theoretical background.                       
              Initial experiments include:  1) the geometrical optics of a                   
              telescope; 2) construction and properties of vacuum systems; 3)                
              thermal cooling in a vacuum; and 4) production of thin metallic                
              films and measurement of their electrical resistivity.  As the                 
              course develops new experiments will be added including simple                 
              analogue and digital electronics and the use of analogue and                   
              digital methods to measure the output of an electrical sensor.                 
              Wherever possible special emphasis is being placed on how                      
              computers can be used to take, analyze and simulate data.  The                 
              laboratories are open ended with emphasis on the acquisition of                
              experimental skills and knowledge.
