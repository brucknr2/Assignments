Abstract    :
              A soil coring rig is being used to core surficial materials to                 
              a depth of 25 feet or greater, increasing students' exposure to                
              a wide range of material only accessible through study of                      
              intact soil cores.  The easily extracted cores allow students                  
              to map subsurface paleotopography, ascertain bulk density,                     
              particle size over depth and soil structure over depth, do                     
              stratigraphic correlations, describe soil horizonation,                        
              ascertain the extent of cultural overburden, and relate soil                   
              properties to rooting depth for trees and other plants.  This                  
              equipment is shared by five departments at Memphis State                       
              University and Rhodes College.
