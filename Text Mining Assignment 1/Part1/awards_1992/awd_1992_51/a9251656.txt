Abstract    :
              This project intends to reshape the laboratory component of the                
              Computer Organization course and provide a model for such                      
              laboratories at other small colleges.  Instead of directing                    
              attention to programming a microprocessor the lab will focus on                
              the structure of computer components and the ways in which this                
              structure shapes the programming process.  Through simulation                  
              students will experiment with the construction of individual                   
              components, the interconnection of those components, and the                   
              manner in which this affects the process of mapping software                   
              into hardware.  In order to support this means of educational                  
              experimentation the project will acquire ten PC-level                          
              computers, printer, system software, and a particular software                 
              package upon which to base the lab experiments.
