Abstract    :
              An Undergraduate Software Engineering Laboratory                               
              This project will create a software engineering laboratory                     
              based on a client/server cluster consisting of a file server                   
              and high-performance workstations.  This will make possible the                
              enhancement of one existing course, and the creation of three                  
              others.  These courses, Computer Networks, Distributed and                     
              Parallel Systems, Software Design and Software Environments,                   
              together with other courses will improve and support the                       
              software engineering concentration within the computer science                 
              major program at Oswego.  Implementation will substantially                    
              strengthen Oswego's ability to graduate competent software                     
              engineers.
