Abstract    :
              This project will equip a departmental computer graphics                       
              laboratory with several color workstations.  This will enable                  
              the department to make computer graphics a regular part of the                 
              computer science curriculum, to use advanced color graphics in                 
              other courses in computer science and mathematics (such as                     
              discrete structures and complex analysis), and to offer                        
              students doing independent work a facility well suited to                      
              research in computer graphics.
