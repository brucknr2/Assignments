Abstract    :
              The goal of this project is to provide a hands-on laboratory                   
              experience in Advanced Methods in Human Computer Interaction                   
              including Multimedia, for undergraduate computer science                       
              students. Presently, a human computer interface course exists.                 
              It is primarily a lecture style course with limited hands-on                   
              work using conventional computing environments.  The world of                  
              human computer interaction has recently seen expansion in new                  
              innovative and multi-modal input/output devices (e.g., voice                   
              recognition, touch screen, multimedia, virtual reality                         
              environments) as opposed to traditional keyboard, display and                  
              mouse arrangements.  The equipment acquired in this project                    
              will provide students with the opportunity to use new dedicated                
              hardware specifically developed for multimedia applications                    
              (the use of audio, voice, text and graphics).   The                            
              significance of the project is to provide a laboratory                         
              exploring new worlds of human computer interaction and to                      
              provide students the opportunity to explore these worlds using                 
              innovative devices on different hardware platforms in a                        
              supervised laboratory setting.
