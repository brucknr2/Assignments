Abstract    :
              Teams of engineering students will use the new Integrated                      
              Design Laboratory to design a complete robot, off-road vehicle,                
              or similar project using modern design tools. They will use                    
              solid modelling, parametric design, modern product database                    
              systems, computerized project planning and coordination systems                
              and design optimization tools. Computer science students will                  
              develop software projects, using modern CASE tools in a typical                
              networked workgroup setting.  They will explore modern graphics                
              applications with high-performance PC computer systems, and                    
              experiment with numerical methods using modern symbolic                        
              computation packages, and develop expert system applications                   
              with powerful AI tools.  Cartography students will explore the                 
              emerging field of Graphic Information Systems using modern                     
              digital mapping and database techniques, including a digital                   
              database for the southeastern Wisconsin area.  The new                         
              laboratory consists of a network of modern workstations and                    
              comprehensive integrated systems of supporting software.
