Abstract    :
              The Department of Chemistry is purchasing a gas chromatography                 
              mass spectrometer (GC-MS).  The instrument is being                            
              incorporated throughout the curriculum, from introductory                      
              courses for non-science majors to the senior research program                  
              for chemistry majors.  Acquisition of the GC-MS is making                      
              possible the development of a new environmental chemistry                      
              program.
