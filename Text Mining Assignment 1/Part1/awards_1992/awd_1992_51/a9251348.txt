Abstract    :
              A Calculus Laboratory course is being designed to supplement                   
              the traditional calculus course with more interesting and                      
              challenging exercises. The laboratory exercises are designed to                
              improve understanding of important concepts and to provide an                  
              introduction to mathematical modeling.  The students meet once                 
              a week for an extended period (up to three hours) to work on                   
              these exercises.  This allows them to work on problems in                      
              substantially more detail and depth than is usually possible in                
              a first year calculus course.  Written reports on each exercise                
              emphasize clarity and style as well as content; teaching                       
              students to write clearly about technical topics is a major                    
              goal of the laboratory course.
