Abstract    :
              This project provides for changes and enhancements throughout                  
              the digital and computer engineering series of courses. The                    
              changes range from additions of programmable logic design                      
              experiments at the introductory level to major changes in the                  
              area of microprocessor design.  The changes include a focus on                 
              high level languages and carefully structured top down design,                 
              and use of a detailed graphical simulation of the operation of                 
              a microprocessor.  A new topic in real time programming is also                
              being included. Equipment being acquired includes a number of                  
              Macintosh computers, some field programmable gate array                        
              development systems, and appropriate peripheral equipment.
