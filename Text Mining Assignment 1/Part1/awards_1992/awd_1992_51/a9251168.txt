Abstract    :
              The goal of the project is to provide a unique approach to                     
              instruction in all Zoology, Anatomy and Physiology, and                        
              Microbiology laboratories at Itawamba Community College.  By                   
              utilizing video equipment in each lab, the instructor can                      
              instruct each student more effectively.   The utilization of                   
              this equipment will provide a more effective laboratory                        
              learning experience for all biology students, by allowing the                  
              students to see microscopic specimens more clearly, see                        
              demonstration dissections more clearly, and will allow students                
              to review procedures performed as many times as he/she wishes.                 
              The new equipment will also allow instructors to develop lab                   
              activities for students that are physically challenged.
