Abstract    :
              The Telecommunications Systems Technology program at the County                
              College of Morris is improving its Data Communications                         
              Laboratory with the addition of a modern Private Branch                        
              Exchange (PBX) Telephone Switch.  Students in this laboratory                  
              learn how architecture, functions, interfaces, and protocols                   
              influence the use of the switching system in the telephone                     
              industry and how it serves end users of telephone and                          
              information services.  The laboratory telephone system provides                
              Telecommunications Systems Technology students with improved                   
              skills and hands-on laboratory experience and understanding                    
              related to courses in telecommunications, data communications,                 
              and electrical engineering technology.
