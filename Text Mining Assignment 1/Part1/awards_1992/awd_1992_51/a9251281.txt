Abstract    :
              This project will provide partial funding to equip a teaching                  
              laboratory with 14 workstations for twelve students and two                    
              instructors.  The project will provide for a number of                         
              improvements in the curriculum:  1) The courses in the                         
              curriculum for majors will be taught in an interactive, hands-                 
              on, doing instead of listening manner.  Laboratory sessions                    
              will provide for more one on one time with professors and                      
              knowledgeable proctors; 2) The curriculum will become more real                
              world.  The students will do their learning in a production                    
              type environment using state-of-the-art software engineering                   
              and development tools.  The environment includes UNIX  and X-                  
              Windows based tools; 3) The computer learning environment will                 
              become more graphical.  The students will be able to better                    
              learn about program execution and structure because of                         
              graphical tools that trace execution, that measure execution,                  
              and show the structure of programs and systems of programs; 4)                 
              The project will allow for group learning managed by the                       
              instructor using the environment's revision control system and                 
              module library capability; and 5) The project will allow for                   
              presentation of the content of the curriculum along side the                   
              practice of the field.  This is accomplished by allowing                       
              students to reuse their own previously developed programs,                     
              techniques, and experiences in a software environment in later                 
              courses in the curriculum thereby reinforcing the usefulness                   
              and importance of their previous work and courses.
