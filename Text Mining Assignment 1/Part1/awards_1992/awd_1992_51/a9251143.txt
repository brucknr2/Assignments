Abstract    :
              The goal of the human psychophysiology project at Oberlin                      
              College is to introduce undergraduate psychology students to                   
              the inter-relationships of behavior, body, and brain by                        
              offering an innovative course in human physiology in which                     
              students will learn basic psychophysiological measures (e.g.,                  
              EEC, EMG, EDA, blood pressure, respiration) as well as the                     
              biological principles underlying these measures.  Structured                   
              weekly laboratory sessions, in which students will learn                       
              procedures and follow protocols using one another as subjects                  
              will provide hands-on experience.  The psychophysiology                        
              laboratory will also allow students and faculty to conduct                     
              independent research projects related to psychophysiological                   
              function.  The project should serve as a model for developing                  
              a program in human psychophysiology at the undergraduate level.
