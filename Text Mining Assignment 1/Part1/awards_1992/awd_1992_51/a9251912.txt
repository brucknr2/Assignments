Abstract    :
              This project will overcome major deficiencies that exist in the                
              laboratories of General Ecology, Plant Ecology, and Plant                      
              Physiology at Southwest Texas State University (SWT) by                        
              developing new and innovative exercises in the area of plant                   
              physiological ecology.  These exercises address topics that are                
              fundamental to terrestrial ecology and plant physiology ,i.e.                  
              photosynthesis, solar radiation, and resource competition.  The                
              new exercises emphasize the quantitative and experimental                      
              nature of present-day ecology and plant physiology and combine                 
              modern instrumentation with computer simulation modeling as                    
              instructional tools.  Specific topics covered include the                      
              ecological significance of C3 and C4 photosynthesis, canopy                    
              architecture, and photosynthesis in species mixtures and                       
              monocultures, photomorphogenic effects of solar radiation, leaf                
              energy balance, solar ultraviolet radiation, and stratospheric                 
              ozone depletion.
