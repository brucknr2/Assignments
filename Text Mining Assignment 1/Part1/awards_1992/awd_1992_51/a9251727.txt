Abstract    :
              Learning Mathematics with Computers                                            
              The intent of this project is to find ways of presenting                       
              mathematics to college students, both mathematics majors and                   
              non-majors, in such a way as to enhance their motivation for                   
              studying mathematics and to help develop their mathematical                    
              intuition.  The regular use by students of computers, both in                  
              the classroom and in homework assignments, allows wide use of                  
              discovery learning, with its emphasis upon making conjectures                  
              and testing their validity.  Access to computers allows the                    
              courses to be taught in ways which emphasize the graphical and                 
              numerical aspects of mathematics, as well as the analytical.                   
              This project will impact every student who graduates from                      
              Franklin College, since all courses which can be utilized to                   
              meet the graduation requirement are affected. A recently                       
              awarded grant from Lilly Endowment, Inc., aids in this process                 
              by providing released time for the investigators for the                       
              development of course materials. The project uses a 15                         
              workstation classroom/laboratory equipped with Z-486 computers,                
              an EtherWORKS network served by a DEC PCLAN/Server 3100, and                   
              four Cannon BJ-300 printers served by a DECserver 90L.
