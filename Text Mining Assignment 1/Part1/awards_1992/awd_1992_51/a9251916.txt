Abstract    :
              A computer-equipped Quantitative Learning Center is being                      
              developed; it is led by a faculty Director, staffed by student                 
              peer consultants, and modeled on Rollins College's Writing                     
              Center.  In addition, related faculty workshops enable faculty                 
              to redesign or modify introductory courses to include modules                  
              on quantitative problem solving and data handling skills, and                  
              to take advantage of the services of the Center and its                        
              Director.  The Center emphasizes interactive and collaborative                 
              learning techniques and the teaching of problem solving.  This                 
              project is a vehicle for coalescing and institutionalizing many                
              successful individual and group efforts throughout the campus.
