Abstract    :
              Undergraduate students learn modern molecular techniques by                    
              exploring the luxA gene. Techniques employed include density                   
              gradient separations, construction of a genomic library,                       
              subcloning, and characterization and sequencing.  Equipment                    
              includes: an ultracentrifuge and sequencing gel systems.  Other                
              courses employing elements of these techniques and utilizing                   
              the equipment include microbiology, biochemistry, instrumental                 
              analysis, developmental biology, animal physiology and both the                
              NSF Summer Enrichment Program for high school teachers and a                   
              fall workshop for talented high school juniors.
