Abstract    :
              Students use a diiode array spectrometer to analyze; the                       
              kinetics of enzyme and organic reactions, DNA melting curves                   
              and DNA-drug interactions, and the spectra of pharmaceuticals.                 
              In addition the instrument is used for analysis of materials                   
              collected during an interdepartmental (biology, geography,                     
              chemistry) study of pollutants in the Pike River. Students also                
              use this instrument for independent research projects.
