Abstract    :
              The Geography Department is establishing a Digital Earth                       
              Sciences Laboratory (DESL) for use by  sophomores, juniors, and                
              seniors in  Botany, Geography, Geology, and Zoology courses.                   
              The students are utilizing the DESL to obtain information about                
              Earth's biosphere, lithosphere, hydrosphere, and atmosphere via                
              acquisition of data from the field observations and from remote                
              sensing methods.  By integrating information from both the                     
              biological and earth sciences the students are able to model an                
              ecosystem's response to natural or human caused environmental                  
              changes.
