Abstract    :
              The Department of Chemistry is designing and implementing of a                 
              series of spectrochemical analysis experiments that uses                       
              instrumentation modules including sources, sampling devices,                   
              and detectors that may be incorporated interchangeably into six                
              different types of spectral arrangements.  These modular                       
              experiments offer the advantage of cost effectiveness, low                     
              maintenance requirements and a high degree of flexibility.  An                 
              example of this approach is the analysis of the concentration                  
              of a metal by flame emission.  The student assembles the                       
              instrument from an air/acetylene flame unit, a monochromomter                  
              and a photomultiplier tube detector.  The latter two modules                   
              are used by students wishing to assemble a fluoresence                         
              spectrometer or a uv/vis spectrometer for differing analyses.
