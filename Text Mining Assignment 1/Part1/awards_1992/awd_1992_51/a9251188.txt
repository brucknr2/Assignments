Abstract    :
              An acoustics laboratory is being developed for inclusion in a                  
              five-week intensive course on musical acoustics.  Non-science                  
              majors are the primary target audiences.  Twenty-four students                 
              are meeting five days a week for a two-hour session of lecture,                
              demonstration and discussion.  Students working in pairs                       
              complete a two-hour laboratory experiment each day, in two                     
              shifts of 12 students each.  In the first two weeks of the                     
              course, experiments are being developed to introduce concepts                  
              of mechanics, including vibrations and waves, necessary to                     
              understand acoustic phenomena.  Resonances in mechanical and                   
              acoustic systems are a primary focus, using instruments such as                
              photogate timers, oscilloscopes, microphones, function                         
              generators and sound level meters.  Spectral analysis of a                     
              variety of instruments and sound generators is the topic of the                
              second group of experiments.  Each of six lab stations includes                
              a Fast Fourier Transform spectrum analyzer for real-time                       
              analysis, a high-quality microphone with preamplifier, and a                   
              plotter.  These stations allow students to explore a wide range                
              of acoustic phenomena in quantitative detail.  Acquired                        
              techniques are being used in independent student projects.  The                
              equipment is also providing senior thesis opportunities.
