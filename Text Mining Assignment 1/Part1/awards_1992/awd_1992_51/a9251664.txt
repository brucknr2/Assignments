Abstract    :
              The goal of this proposal is to bring modern spectroscopic                     
              methods into our laboratory courses in physical chemistry.  The                
              specific aims of our proposal are:  1) to create five modern                   
              spectroscopic experiments based on a pulsed dye laser system;                  
              2) to specify an instrument package that is within the                         
              budgetary reach of chemistry departments at most institutions;                 
              3) to develop the experiments to the point that they can be                    
              adopted by instructors who lack prior expertise in laser                       
              spectroscopy; 4) to expose students in the introductory and                    
              advanced physical chemistry laboratories to modern techniques                  
              in physical chemistry; and 5) to communicate the results of our                
              program both regionally and nationally through presentations at                
              scientific meetings and publication.
