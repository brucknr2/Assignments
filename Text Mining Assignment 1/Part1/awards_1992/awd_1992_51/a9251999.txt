Abstract    :
              This project adds optical systems and optical communication to                 
              the electro-optics curriculum laboratory in the Electronic                     
              Engineering Technology program at Portland Community College to                
              meet the demands of a growing electro-optics industry.  The                    
              equipment consists of low-power helium neon and diode lasers,                  
              optical work benches with precision translation stages,                        
              photometers, monochrometers and related optics, fiber optics                   
              and mounting hardware for twelve experimental stations and one                 
              optical time domain reflectometer.  This addition allows                       
              students to acquire many of the skills an electronics                          
              technician needs to function effectively in a modern electro-                  
              optic environment that uses lasers and fiber optics.  The                      
              improved curriculum is designed so that through the measurement                
              of laser and fiber characteristics, the student verifies                       
              fundamental optical principles and obtains the practical                       
              optical skills required.
