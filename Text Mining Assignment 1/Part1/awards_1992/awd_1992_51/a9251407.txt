Abstract    :
              To improve calculus instruction by placing a greater emphasis                  
              on conceptual understanding, Elizabethtown College is                          
              incorporating the use of the computer algebra system DERIVE                    
              into its calculus sequence.  Shifting the burden of computation                
              to DERIVE allows students to concentrate more fully on learning                
              ideas and fosters a more inquisitive attitude towards                          
              mathematics.  Students meet in the computer laboratory twice a                 
              week to work through laboratory problems designed to teach,                    
              illustrate, and reinforce the concepts of calculus.  In                        
              addition once a week, they meet in the laboratory to work in                   
              groups solving problems involving applications of what they                    
              have learned.  The fourth weekly class is used for class                       
              discussion and group presentations.  An accompanying laboratory                
              manual, which is being written, will be of interest to other                   
              institutions thinking of using a computer algebra system as a                  
              tool in calculus instruction.  Initially, two sections of the                  
              courses are running concurrently, one with laboratories and one                
              without, so that a comparative study can be developed to                       
              determine whether and to what extent the new course structure                  
              is an improvement.
