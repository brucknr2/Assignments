Abstract    :
              The Department of Chemistry is purchasing a capillary column                   
              gas chromatograph/FID and thermal analyzer (DSC and TGA) to                    
              enable students in organic and analytical chemistry courses to                 
              work in terms on mini-research projects requiring multiple                     
              laboratory sessions.  Organic chemistry students are using gas                 
              chromatography to explore: the relative efficiencies of                        
              different distillation techniques, isomer distributions in                     
              natural products, the stereochemistry of reduction of chiral                   
              ketones, and the regiochemistry of hydroboration-oxidation of                  
              unsymmetrical alkenes.  Differential scanning calorimetry is                   
              also being used in organic chemistry to characterize polymers.                 
              Analytical chemistry students are detecting volatile organics                  
              in blood plasma and  using thermal gravimetry to quantitatively                
              analyze mixtures of oxalate salts.
