Abstract    :
              The aim of the project is to establish a computer-based                        
              laboratory to enhance the teaching and investigation of human                  
              memory and cognition.  Five computers with specialized software                
              that can be programmed by relatively inexperienced users will                  
              simulate a number of experimental paradigms that require brief                 
              visual displays and millisecond timing.  In addition to                        
              enhancing a class in memory and cognition, the equipment will                  
              allow introduction of a new laboratory course as part of the                   
              proposed curriculum revision.  Students will use the more                      
              advanced laboratory to pursue individualized research projects,                
              applying the methods and findings of cognitive science to a                    
              problem of their choice.
