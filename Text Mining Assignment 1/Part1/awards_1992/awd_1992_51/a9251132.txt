Abstract    :
              Students in the Electrical Engineering department of the City                  
              College of CUNY are learning about wireless digital                            
              communications in a newly established laboratory.  They study                  
              the performance of digital modulation techniques in various                    
              fading environments and focus on techniques and environments                   
              that they specify.  The laboratory equipment enables the                       
              students not only to observe modulation techniques, but also                   
              allows them to create their own experiments and answer their                   
              own questions to self posed problems requiring their active                    
              participation.  These laboratory problems are similar to those                 
              encountered in the booming wireless communication industry and                 
              in some related topics of graduate studies.
