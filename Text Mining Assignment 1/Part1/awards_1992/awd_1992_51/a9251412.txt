Abstract    :
              A computer laboratory is being established to support the                      
              training of pre-service elementary teachers.  Students in the                  
              computer literacy and geometry segments of the teacher                         
              preparation program will gain hands-on experience in using                     
              computers and educational software.  The computer languages                    
              BASIC and LOGO will be used to develop computer literacy and                   
              reduce computer anxiety in prospective teachers.  Via the                      
              GEOMETRIC SUPPOSER software packages, students will be able to                 
              explore geometric concepts interactively in the proposed                       
              laboratory.  Students will be more actively involved in their                  
              own education and will develop confidence in their ability to                  
              use this and other software in their classroom teaching                        
              situations after leaving the university.
