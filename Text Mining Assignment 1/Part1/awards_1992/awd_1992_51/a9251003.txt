Abstract    :
              The Department of Chemistry is purchasing a 200 MHz FT-NMR                     
              spectrometer with a 1H/ 13C probe, variable temperature                        
              capabilities, and a sample changer.  The use of nmr is being                   
              incorporated into all four years of the undergraduate chemistry                
              curriculum beginning with the freshmen honors course and                       
              culminating with two new senior-level courses.  One of these                   
              courses involves inorganic and organic approaches to synthesis.                
              Student projects include following the evolution of the active                 
              site of a metal-catalyzed cycloaddition reaction, thus                         
              familiarizing students with the process of synthesis-                          
              characterization-design/redesign cycle important to solving                    
              problems in chemical synthesis.  The second new senior-level                   
              course emphasizes the principles of fourier transform NMR                      
              spectroscopy and more advanced laboratory applications of NMR                  
              including, command mode of operation, spectral optimization,                   
              DEPT, selective homonuclear decoupling, solvent suppression,                   
              multiple quantum filtered COSY and other advanced two-                         
              dimensional experiments.  The sample changer allows students                   
              enrolled in the introductory organic chemistry laboratory to                   
              obtain routine NMR spectra of their reaction products.
