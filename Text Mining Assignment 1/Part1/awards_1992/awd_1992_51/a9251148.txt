Abstract    :
              A fourier transform infrared spectrophotometer (FT-IR) and two                 
              thermal conductivity detector gas chromatographs (GC) with                     
              integrators will be used in the laboratory portion of an                       
              integrated organic chemistry course.  It will better                           
              understanding of the principles and reactions discussed in the                 
              lecture.  Several problem-solving experiments will be used.  In                
              addition to allowing a significant increase in the number of IR                
              spectra that can be obtained, the quantitative and spectral                    
              searching capabilities of the FT-IR will be exploited.  The GC                 
              will be configured as a thermal reactor and used to run and                    
              analyze several reactions.  Other uses will include product                    
              isolation from microscale reactions and product analysis using                 
              electronic integration.  The project will impact science                       
              education majors and a wide variety of students in other                       
              disciplines as well as chemistry majors.
