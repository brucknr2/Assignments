Abstract    :
              Computers are integrated into large enrollment laboratory                      
              courses in order to:  (1) provide access to on-line data                       
              sampling, (2) combine simulations and/or animation with on-line                
              data collection programs, and (3) generate the capacity to                     
              obtain hard copies of rapid physiological phenomena (for                       
              example, an action potential).  In the introductory                            
              laboratories, exercises are enhanced by capturing data on                      
              computers and then generating visual images of the principle                   
              events leading to the recorded data.  Important physiological                  
              concepts are explored by allowing students to alter selected                   
              variables in software (for example, time, distance, or                         
              temperature) and observing a simulation of how their recorded                  
              results might change.  In the advanced systemic physiology                     
              courses, computers collect and analyze data on-line.
