Abstract    :
              The project revamps several laboratory courses and                             
              develops a new laboratory course in powder metallurgy to                       
              produce a unified approach to teaching advanced materials use                  
              and processing to mechanical engineers.  The acquisition of a                  
              x-ray sedigraph completes the laboratory facility development                  
              for the material science and engineering plan to enhance its                   
              undergraduate curriculum.  The goals of this plan are to return                
              materials processing to an equal leg of the processing, structure,             
              property triangle that is the materials engineering paradigm, and              
              to better focus our undergraduate curriculum on the education of               
              mechanical engineers.  The enhanced laboratory is also used in a               
              statistics course.
