Abstract    :
              The Science Department is purchasing a automatic purge and                     
              trap/dynamic headspace sampler to add to its existing gas                      
              chromatograph-mass spectrometer system.  This equipment allows                 
              for the introduction of Environmental Protection Agency                        
              protocols  into appropriate areas of the science curriculum.                   
              These protocols call for the measurement of volatiles and semi-                
              volatiles in complex matrices while avoiding costly, time-                     
              consuming extraction and cleanup.  Students are first                          
              introduced to the equipment in a special course in instrumental                
              analysis where they perform experiments involving the analysis                 
              of air samples, petroleum products, plastics, foods and drugs.                 
              In the organic chemistry course, students separate volatiles                   
              from a synthetic preparations.  Other courses in which the                     
              instrument is used include toxicology, biochemistry, and                       
              engineering hydrology.
