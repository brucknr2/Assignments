Abstract    :
              The Department of Chemistry is acquiring a gas                                 
              chromatograph/mass spectrometer system for use across the                      
              curriculum from general introductory courses for non-science                   
              majors to chemistry majors' senior research projects.  In                      
              addition, to using the instrument for reaction product                         
              characterization, students in organic chemistry are studying                   
              rearrangement reactions occuring in the mass spectrometer.                     
              Analytical chemistry students are investigating the presence                   
              and identity of volatile organics in rain.  The instrument is                  
              having a significant impact on the undergraduate research                      
              program.
