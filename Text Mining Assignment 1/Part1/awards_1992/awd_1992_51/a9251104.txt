Abstract    :
              A flexible data acquisition and control system is used for                     
              undergraduate instruction and projects in a thermodynamics and                 
              fluid mechanics laboratory.  The system consists of four IBM                   
              PC-compatible computers, each equipped with an internal data                   
              acquisition board and a hard disk on which reside several                      
              compilers and a programmable graphing and data analysis                        
              package.  Two of the machines are laptop (portable) computers                  
              and two are 386-based desktop computers.  Laboratories                         
              currently included in the engineering curriculum will be                       
              revised to incorporate real-time data acquisition, graphing,                   
              and data analysis using the computers.  These laboratories                     
              include the analysis of combustion engines, heat pumps, wind                   
              tunnel measurements, solar energy collection, heat transfer                    
              studies, soils analysis, and investigations of liquid flow                     
              systems.  The equipment also has the capability of producing                   
              output control signals that can adjust in real time the                        
              physical parameters of processes under investigation.
