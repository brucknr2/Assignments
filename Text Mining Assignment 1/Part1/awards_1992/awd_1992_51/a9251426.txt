Abstract    :
              This project adds a laboratory component to an undergraduate                   
              genetics course taken by majors in biology and majors in                       
              secondary school life science education. Equipment purchased                   
              includes: a centrifuge (Beckman J2-21), microcentrifuge                        
              (Beckman), a chromatography refrigerator, a shaker (Orbit), a                  
              sterile transfer hood (Labconco), and 5 compound (Laboval) and                 
              5 dissecting (Meiji) microscopes.  Laboratories to be added                    
              include exercises in both classical and modern genetics with                   
              emphasis on integrating results from both.  Experiments to be                  
              implemented include:  analysis of crosses, gene mapping, gene                  
              interactions, gene regulation, mutagenesis, cytogenetics and                   
              recombinant DNA.
