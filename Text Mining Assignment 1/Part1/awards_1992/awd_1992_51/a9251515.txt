Abstract    :
              The specific objective of the project is to strengthen the                     
              laboratory part of the curriculum in the thermodynamics and                    
              combustion engines areas.  The improvement will be achieved by                 
              adding modern instrumentation as well as conventional                          
              instrumentation that allows design and implementation of new                   
              laboratory experiments to cover and complement a broad spectrum                
              of topics covered in classes in applied thermodynamics and                     
              combustion engines. The implementation of the laboratory                       
              upgrading program will significantly improve preparation of                    
              undergraduates to understand and analyze complex problems faced                
              by industry, research laboratories, and in postgraduate                        
              research in thermodynamics and combustion engines. The                         
              laboratory will also be used in a Saturday program for local                   
              high school students.
