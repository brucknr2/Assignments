Abstract    :
              The Department of Chemistry is purchasing a helium/cadmium                     
              laser and associated equipment for use several undergraduate                   
              courses.  In the instrument analysis course, students perform                  
              a fluorescence spectroscopy experiment to become familiar with                 
              the capability and operation of the instrument.  In the                        
              physical chemistry course, they carry out a Raman spectroscopy                 
              investigation as a practical application of group theory.  In                  
              addition, the instrument is used by faculty to perform lecture                 
              demonstrations, and by students to perform additional                          
              experiments in several upper division courses.
