Abstract    :
              Digital technology has revolutionized the way scientists                       
              approach the measurement and the analysis of experimental data.                
              Today's laboratory instruments are capable of digitizing                       
              complex detector responses, produce instant numerical readouts,                
              and transfer the information to a computer for further                         
              processing and permanent storage.  Once loaded into a computer,                
              these datafiles can be accurately compared to theoretical                      
              expectations with relative ease using commonly available                       
              commercial software.  While such procedures are currently the                  
              norm in most research or industrial laboratories, they are                     
              often ignored in introductory physics laboratories where many                  
              aspiring science students gain their first and often last                      
              chance to study experimental methods in the physical sciences.                 
              This project is modifying an existing set of undergraduate                     
              laboratory experiments involving analog oscilloscopes, commonly                
              performed at most institutions, to include an introduction to                  
              digital technology and computer data analysis.  The project is                 
              being implemented with the acquisition of analog/digital                       
              oscilloscopes, IBM compatible personal computers, and commonly                 
              available scientific software for these computers.
