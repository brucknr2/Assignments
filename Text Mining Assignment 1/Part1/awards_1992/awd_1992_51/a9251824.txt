Abstract    :
              The goal of the project is to establish an undergraduate                       
              communication science laboratory. A network of Macintosh                       
              computer workstations will interface with already existing                     
              transducers permitting students to compare source movements,                   
              resulting air disturbance and acoustic outcomes related to                     
              speech and hearing.  Students will also assist in the design of                
              HyperCard programs for self-directed, interactive instruction                  
              in speech and hearing science.  The project will: 1) provide                   
              undergraduate experiences in basic science that are critically                 
              tied to speech and hearing; 2) lead to the development of                      
              interactive, instructional computer programs in speech                         
              acoustics; 3) provide research mentoring early in                              
              students' academic careers; and 4) help to promote speech and                  
              hearing careers for women and minorities.
