Abstract    :
              This project will improve the first-semester laboratory in                     
              Human Chemistry, a course for nurses and physician's                           
              assistants.  The project will enhance the student's learning                   
              experience beyond that found in a traditional lecture and wet                  
              chemistry laboratory.  This involves overcoming prior                          
              deficiencies, developing the ability to analyze and conclude,                  
              and nurturing a student's desire for inquiry.  An interactive                  
              workstation laboratory that  consists of specially equipped IBM                
              PS/2 57's attached to laserdisc players, using Exploring                       
              Chemistry II, an interactive videodisc laboratory in general                   
              chemistry, will accomplish these goals.  Fifteen additional                    
              interactive videodisc experiments will be included with the ten                
              wet chemistry experiments already in the laboratory schedule.
