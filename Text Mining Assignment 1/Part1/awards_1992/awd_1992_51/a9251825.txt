Abstract    :
              To promote leadership among future scientists by providing                     
              practical exercises that foster critical decision making                       
              skills, this project has as its goal the formulation of                        
              guidelines and the development of case-studies in natural                      
              resource policy, applied science, and resource development                     
              issues.  The cases are to be used in a new undergraduate                       
              program in environmental science and collected in a                            
              library/repository at the University, and made available to                    
              educators in environmental studies elsewhere.  The case                        
              studies, which are being developed in collaboration with                       
              students in the course, provide an ongoing source of well-                     
              written current teaching materials for courses in marine                       
              affairs, business, law, engineering, and the social and natural                
              sciences.  They emphasize the interaction of natural science                   
              and social science in the formulation of policies for the                      
              management of natural resources.
