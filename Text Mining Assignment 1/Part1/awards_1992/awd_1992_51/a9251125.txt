Abstract    :
              A two semester introductory, multidisciplinary course for non-                 
              science majors is being developed.  The course is designed with                
              concept modules incorporating major themes in biology,                         
              chemistry, and physics through hands-on experiments focusing on                
              selected major processes, principles, and paradigms of modern                  
              science.  Sensors, spectrophotometers, and personal computers                  
              are used for recording of data and graphical display of                        
              results.  Experimental protocols emphasize how data can be                     
              collected, analyzed, and used to validate or amplify accepted                  
              theories.  Durable, basic instruments have been selected so                    
              that experimenters are taught to use scientific instruments                    
              with ease and confidence.  Throughout the course, an emphasis                  
              is placed on showing how quantitative results are necessary to                 
              scientific arguments, especially in terms of identifying key                   
              parameters and components that are relevant to modern                          
              environmental and business decisions.
