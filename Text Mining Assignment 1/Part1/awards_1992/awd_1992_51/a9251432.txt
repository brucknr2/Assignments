Abstract    :
              Improvements in a psychoacoustics laboratory at Lawrence                       
              University will provide, for non-science majors interested in                  
              music and languages, hands-on experience with an enhanced,                     
              real-time analysis of acoustic signals.  A sound spectrograph                  
              and support instruments will allow development of a laboratory                 
              component in Psycholinguistics and Psychology of Music.  The                   
              real-time sound spectrograph will provide immediate analysis                   
              and display of speech and musical stimuli.  Additional                         
              instruments, microcomputers, and software will record and                      
              correlate physiological measures, such as vocal cord action and                
              airflow, with the acoustical measures.  This equipment will                    
              permit students to demonstrate and test experimentally the                     
              effect of articulatory and respiratory changes, emotional                      
              state, and acoustic information on the perception of music and                 
              speech.  The goal of this improvement is to engage non-science                 
              majors in the scientific study of speech and music by the                      
              presentation of compelling, immediately accessible                             
              demonstrations and augmented interactive laboratory                            
              experiences.  Students working on independent projects in the                  
              psychophysics of music and speech will also use the equipment.
