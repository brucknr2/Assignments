Abstract    :
              NeXt based computer and data acquisition equipment expands the                 
              ability of the Biology Department to offer students the                        
              opportunity to enhance their understanding of basic principles                 
              through computer representations and analysis. Instructional                   
              software supplements students' hands-on exploration of                         
              biological concepts and methodologies.
