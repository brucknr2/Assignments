Abstract    :
              Parallel processing is now a significant component of large                    
              computation, and it will become increasingly so in the future.                 
                This project is directed at giving students a hands-on                       
              environment in which they can grasp the issues involved with                   
              the several models for parallel computation, via the use of                    
              transputer hardware.  These issues will be studied both via the                
              language OCCAM and through use of a parallel-C compiler.The                    
              plan is to introduce one new course devoted to parallelism per                 
              se, a second new course devoted to development and analysis of                 
              parallel algorithms, and a third new course--in computer                       
              graphics, but taking full advantage of the parallel computing                  
              facilities.  This latter course will provide applications of                   
              the power of parallelism.  Equally as important, it will                       
              resolve the computational near-impasse that students sometimes                 
              encounter when trying to apply techniques of three-dimensional                 
              graphics and image processing.It is expected that the impact of                
              this facility will not be restricted to these new courses, but                 
              will also influence in varying degrees nine existing upper-                    
              division courses.
