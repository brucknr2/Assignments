Abstract    :
              A differential scanning calorimeter is being acquired for use                  
              in physical chemistry and instrumental analysis courses in                     
              order to introduce thermal methods of analysis into the                        
              chemistry curriculum.  Thermal methods are being used to                       
              characterize widely diverse substances such as polymers, oils,                 
              clays, carbohydrates, and soil, and they also are being used to                
              provide enthalpimetric data which is difficult to obtain by                    
              other methods.  In addition, an instrument is being laboratory-                
              constructed to perform thermometric titrations for use in                      
              situations where conventional calorimetric indicators cannot be                
              used.  Inclusion of instruction in thermal methods is expanding                
              the chemistry curriculum into areas of materials science and is                
              serving as a model for other undergraduate curricula.  The                     
              instrumentation also is being used in the undergraduate                        
              research program.
