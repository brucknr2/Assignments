Abstract    :
              This project relies on computers and molecular biology                         
              equipment to reorganize and modernize a large (1300                            
              students/year) entry level Principles of Biology laboratory                    
              which serves students in the biology program and several                       
              biomedical and health science programs.  The number of biology                 
              experiments/semester are 50% less than in the past in order to                 
              encourage students to pose problems, plan experiments, and                     
              analyze and present their quantitative results for student peer                
              review.  Laboratory experiments feature comparison of student                  
              generated data with that derived from computer simulations.                    
              Equipment includes Spectronic 20 spectrophotometers (1/student                 
              pair), Macintosh LC computers (1/student pair), and                            
              electrophoresis equipment (1/4 students).  Video equipment                     
              (1/classroom) is used: 1) by students to review senior faculty                 
              prepared introductions to laboratory exercises, 2) for training                
              of graduate teaching assistants, 3) by the visually and hearing                
              impaired as an adjunct to classroom materials, and 4) for in-                  
              class supplementary demonstrations.
