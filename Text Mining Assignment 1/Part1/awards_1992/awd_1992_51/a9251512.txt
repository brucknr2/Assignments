Abstract    :
              This project places modern biotechnology equipment in the                      
              laboratory for use by students.  The instrumentation is                        
              centered around the electrophoresis procedure which is used to                 
              chemically separate DNA fragments and proteins.  The major                     
              equipment items are electrophoresis chambers, power supplies,                  
              digital pipets, and a gel imaging system.  Students have hands-                
              on use of this equipment and produce a written lab report which                
              includes a section relating the laboratory activities with                     
              actual applications in use in the fields of biology, medicine,                 
              and forensics.
