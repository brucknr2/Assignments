Abstract    :
              The Department of Chemistry of the is purchasing a Fourier                     
              transform infrared spectrophotometer (FT-IR) instruction of                    
              freshmen and sophomore science and non-science students at UW-                 
              Center Rock County.  The instrument is being used by in the                    
              microscale organic laboratory to estimate purity and                           
              characterize synthesis products.  Non-science students also use                
              the spectrophotometerp in their study of how chemists determine                
              the structures of complex molecules.
