Abstract    :
              The realism of computer graphics images increases with the                     
              development of new algorithms which model reality.  Such                       
              algorithms are now possible with the increasing power and                      
              affordability of computers.  Graphics is different from                        
              photography as it can create images which do not exist or                      
              cannot be photographed. For example, images of the rings of                    
              Saturn can be created from the data sent back from space probes                
              and the interaction of atomic particles can be displayed from                  
              data developed on supercomputers. This project will continue                   
              work which animates the process of a system, the algorithm of                  
              a solution. Educational computer videos will be developed                      
              showing the steps in an algorithm or the progress of actions                   
              within a system. The videos will use state-of-the-art graphics                 
              tools such as photorealistic rendering and scientific                          
              visualization.  The project will also develop software tools to                
              aid the process, and manuals to make the techniques accessible                 
              to others. Powerful color workstations which can support the                   
              use of these tools will be acquired as part of this project.
