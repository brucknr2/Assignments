Abstract    :
              The need to eliminate the bottleneck which the calculus has                    
              become for prospective mathematicians, scientists, and                         
              engineers is well documented in recent literature. A computer                  
              laboratory dedicated to the calculus sequence is being                         
              developed which is enhancing student intuition and allows for                  
              experiments in relation to underlying concepts.  The calculus                  
              sequence is taught in the laboratory so that each student has                  
              immediate access to a computer and Computer Algebra System                     
              (CAS) to verify and experiment.
