Abstract    :
              The goal of this project is to improve the hands-on laboratory                 
              experiences of students in courses in social, developmental and                
              clinical psychology at Hobart and William Smith Colleges by                    
              establishing a human observation laboratory suite.  The new                    
              laboratory is equipped with video equipment for remote                         
              observation of human subjects. Employing a biotelemetry system,                
              the physiological monitoring equipment unobtrusively records                   
              indices of emotion (e.g., heart rate) and transmits this                       
              information to the observation room.  Two computer workstations                
              in the laboratory are used for a variety of tasks: coding                      
              videotaped observations; acquiring and transforming                            
              physiological data; integrating data from videotaped                           
              observations with physiological data; and statistical analysis.                
              The equipment will allow students to learn a variety of                        
              techniques in each of these modalities as they address                         
              substantive issues in separate areas of the discipline.
