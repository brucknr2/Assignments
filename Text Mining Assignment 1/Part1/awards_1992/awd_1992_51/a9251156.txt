Abstract    :
              The instrumentation requested will strengthen experimental                     
              approaches to environmental biology.  The automated toxicity                   
              bioassay using bioluminescent bacteria and the computer                        
              controlled respirometer requested will bring recent advances in                
              environmental research capability into the undergraduate                       
              laboratory. Introductory biology students will operate in small                
              research groups and play an active role designing the                          
              experimental approach used to answer meaningful scientific                     
              questions and thus gain a larger sense of what it means to do                  
              modern science.  Once introduced to advanced instruments as                    
              freshman, students can employ them with increasing                             
              sophistication in intermediate and advanced courses.  Toxicity                 
              tests on heavy metals provide the context for examination of                   
              general dose response curves and synergistic effects of other                  
              environmental variables on toxicity.  Respiration measurements                 
              will allow freshmen to explore the effects of temperature on                   
              metabolism.  Advanced students will conduct an intensive                       
              investigation into physiological responses of estuarine animals                
              to hypoxia and anoxia, simulating low oxygen levels typically                  
              found in the Chesapeake Bay.
