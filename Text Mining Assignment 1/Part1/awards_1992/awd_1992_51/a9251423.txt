Abstract    :
              The Department of Chemistry is acquiring graphics-based                        
              workstations for students at all levels to explore such                        
              chemical concepts such as molecular structure, quantum                         
              mechanical energy calculations, energy minimizations and,                      
              simulate/predict reaction mechanisms.  Beginning with the                      
              general chemistry course and continuing throughout the upper                   
              division sequence, computations and molecular descriptions of                  
              increasingly greater complexity are being performed.  In both                  
              the organic and biochemistry courses are students are comparing                
              and contrasting the results of the calculations with those                     
              obtained in the laboratory on the same systems.
