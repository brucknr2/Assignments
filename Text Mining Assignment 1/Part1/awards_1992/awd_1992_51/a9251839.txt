Abstract    :
              The Department of Chemistry is purchasing two gas                              
              chromatographs for use in analytical chemistry, organic and                    
              advanced organic chemistry, and physical chemistry                             
              laboratories.   In the organic and advanced organic chemistry                  
              laboratories, the instruments are used to determine the                        
              enantiomeric excess of reaction products resulting from an                     
              enzymatic hydrolysis of a meso-diester, the composition of                     
              isomeric alkenes derived from an elimination reaction, and the                 
              ratio of products obtained from a carbocation rearrangement.                   
              Students in the physical chemistry laboratory, students are                    
              measuring the thermodynamic properties of solutes and                          
              collecting rate data from a cycloaddition reaction.  Students                  
              engaged in independent study are also using the instruments.
