Abstract    :
              Creation of a Physical Measurement and Imaging Laboratory for                  
              the Archaeology Program at Indiana University of Pennsylvania                  
              will provide training for students in two areas that are not                   
              offered to undergraduates elsewhere.  First, the collection and                
              management of large amounts of archaeological data using a                     
              computer based automatic data collection system.  These are                    
              becoming typical of large archaeological projects, but only                    
              rarely is any training in their use available.  The second                     
              focus of the lab is on instruction about, and the analysis of                  
              image data.  This will have a twofold purpose, first to allow                  
              the teaching of methods and techniques involved in analyzing                   
              overall artifact shape via high resolution images, and second,                 
              to allow instruction of large groups in the nature and analysis                
              of microwear (using video microscopy) on both bone and stone                   
              tools.
