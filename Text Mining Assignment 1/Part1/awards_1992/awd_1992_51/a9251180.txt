Abstract    :
              Future improvements in computer performance will rely on                       
              parallel computing, creating a demand for programmers who can                  
              design and implement algorithms for parallel architectures.                    
              The Parallel Computation Laboratory to be created under this                   
              project will enable the institution to integrate parallelism                   
              into the curriculum over a three-year period, and will support                 
              an upper-division elective on parallel computation.The                         
              laboratory will be implemented using the Inmos transputer, a                   
              relatively low-cost processor designed to cooperate with other                 
              processors by exchanging messages over high-speed links.                       
              Sixteen transputers are housed in Computer Systems Architects'                 
              SuperSet Plus, a platform that enables up to four users to                     
              simultaneously use the transputers.  Each user can specify a                   
              processor interconnection network.  The SuperSet will be                       
              connected to a SUN 4/110 host and will be remotely accessible                  
              via a local area network.
