Abstract    :
              The Department of Plant and Soil Science and the Alabama Center                
              for Applications of Remote Sensing (ACARS) Laboratory is                       
              acquiring equipment for instruction in spatial analysis and                    
              image processing of radiometric data and manipulation and                      
              modeling of geographical data.  The project is enabling                        
              students being trained in soil science, physical geography and                 
              cartography, plant science, environmental science and forestry                 
              an opportunity to acquire a working knowledge of the current                   
              technology being used in the workplace.  Specialized                           
              instruction in the use of the equipment and basic applications                 
              of its use in decision-making processes is being developed.***//
