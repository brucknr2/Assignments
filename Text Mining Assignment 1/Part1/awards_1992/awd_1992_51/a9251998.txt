Abstract    :
              Students majoring in Structural Analysis and Design at the                     
              Department of Engineering Technology of the University of                      
              Houston-Downtown will use laboratory equipment built and                       
              modified specifically for soils and structural model testing,                  
              using off-the-shelf electronic components, peripheral to                       
              existing computers.  In addition to the structural and soil                    
              analysis principles and practices learned by the students in                   
              this laboratory there are data acquisition and software                        
              development aspects that enhance the learning experience of the                
              students even further.
