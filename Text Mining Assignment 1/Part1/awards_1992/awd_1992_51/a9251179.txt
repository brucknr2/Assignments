Abstract    :
              At Misericordia, Discrete Mathematics is a core course which                   
              involves the innovative approach of the mathematical                           
              programming language ISETL to teach according to a Piagetian-                  
              based theory on how students learn advanced mathematical ideas.                
              The institution has also been  utilizing a new approach for                    
              teaching Calculus which was developed by Dubinsky and                          
              Schwingendorf of Purdue University.  Under this project, these                 
              computer-based innovations are being extended into Linear                      
              Algebra, Abstract Algebra, Differential Equations, Numerical                   
              Analysis, and Statistics.                                                      
              The addition of PC terminal capabilities have made these                       
              curricular improvements possible.
