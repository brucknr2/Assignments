Abstract    :
              Equipment is being requested for use in teaching laboratory                    
              exercises illustrating basic molecular biological concepts in                  
              both the lower and upper-division components of the                            
              undergraduate curriculum.  The project will create a modern                    
              molecular biology core facility that will house the major                      
              equipment, namely, an ultracentrifuge and rotors for                           
              fractionating and purifying macromolecules, a DNA sequencing                   
              and computer analysis system, a high technology TV camera with                 
              analysis software, a scintillation counter to monitor                          
              radioisotopes, and a set of general use equipment,e.g.                         
              microfuges, gel boxes,etc.   Students will use the equipment                   
              for the preparation and isolation of chromosomal and plasmid                   
              DNA, RNA, and proteins from organisms used in                                  
              molecular/recombinant biology research and biotechnology.
