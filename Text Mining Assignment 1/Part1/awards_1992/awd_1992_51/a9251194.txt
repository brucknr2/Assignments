Abstract    :
              Computer controlled and monitored fermentor work stations                      
              enable students to investigate the effects of altered                          
              parameters on industrially important fermentation processes.                   
              The project will help prepare students for the diversified                     
              needs of the many pharmaceutical industries and clinical                       
              laboratories in the area.  The equipment will be shared with                   
              students from other institutions in the area.
