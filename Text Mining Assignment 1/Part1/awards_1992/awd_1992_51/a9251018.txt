Abstract    :
              The consortium is purchasing a panoramic solid state optical                   
              detector (a Photometrics CCD and auxiliary hardware and                        
              software) to install on the 24 inch telescope at the Williston                 
              Observatory of Mount Holyoke College.  The telescope will be                   
              used by students from the Five College Astronomy Department and                
              this upgrade is the next phase of a department-wide effort to                  
              provide undergraduate students with hands-on training with                     
              modern instrumentation.  It will provide training for students                 
              in the operation, calibration, and use of CCDs for astronomical                
              imaging and spectroscopy.  The Five College Astronomy                          
              Department will interface the camera to the telescope and                      
              spectrograph, provide a technician for operation and                           
              maintenance, develop laboratories for freshman through senior                  
              level classes, and involve students in a variety of independent                
              research projects.
