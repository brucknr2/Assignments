Abstract    :
              The undergraduate program is being strengthened by providing                   
              student access to Fourier transform infrared (FTIR)                            
              spectroscopy throughout the curriculum, including courses for                  
              non-science majors as well as undergraduate research.  This                    
              project will allow students to use specialized techniques to                   
              conduct investigations that would not be possible otherwise.                   
              For example, non-science students use attenuated total                         
              reflectance to identify unknown fabric samples; organic                        
              chemistry students use diffuse reflectance and thin-layer                      
              chromatography to identify and analyze complex organic                         
              mixtures; physical chemistry students analyze gas phase                        
              spectra, including vibrational isotope shifts; and analytical                  
              chemistry students carry out a modified gas chromatography                     
              interfacing experiment.
