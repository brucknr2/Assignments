Abstract    :
              A modern control systems design laboratory is being implemented                
              in the undergraduate engineering curriculum of the Department                  
              of Systems Science and Mathematics at Washington University.                   
              This Systems Engineering Laboratory enables the teaching of                    
              modern control systems design principles and practice through                  
              the use of advanced but inexpensive hardware with fast personal                
              computers, as well as high speed visually oriented simulation.                 
              Students also develop their own new experiments for Senior                     
              Design Projects in this laboratory.  The laboratory has five                   
              computer workstations, with hardware and software that support                 
              the following elements:  (1) a robot control system, (2) a                     
              computer vision system, (3) a noise cancellation system, (4) a                 
              ball and beam non-linear control experiment, and (5) an                        
              artificial neural network experiment for shape recognition and                 
              system identification.
