Abstract    :
              The Department of Chemistry is upgrading its laboratory                        
              instruction in chemical separations and analysis through the                   
              purchase of a gas chromatograph-mass spectrometer (GC-MS)                      
              system.  The theory and practice of GC-MS analyses is being                    
              integrated into the undergraduate laboratories covering                        
              advanced organic chemistry, instrumental analysis and molecular                
              structure for chemistry majors plus a chemical instrumentation                 
              laboratory course for biologists.  The instrument is also used                 
              in undergraduate student research projects which currently                     
              include efforts to improve precombustion desulfurization of                    
              Illinois coal, novel syntheses of new pharmaceuticals,                         
              synthesis of new catalysts for the chemical industry and the                   
              design of safer artificial sweeteners based on natural                         
              products.
