Abstract    :
              The Deparment of Chemistry is acquiring a Fourier transform                    
              infrared spectrophotometer for use throughout the undergraduate                
              curriculum, including senior research projects.  Students in                   
              organic chemistry are using the instrument to study the                        
              kinetics of esterification reactions, hydrogen bonding as a                    
              function of molecular structure and concentration, while those                 
              in advanced laboratories investigate the composition of                        
              commercial polymers and bonding parameters in small, gaseous                   
              molecules.
