Abstract    :
              The robotics and automation laboratory is being expanded with                  
              the addition of color graphics workstations, software for                      
              three-dimensional animation of robots and automated                            
              manufacturing systems, and the construction of robot arms.  The                
              equipment enhances instruction in off-line programming,                        
              workcell design, robotic assembly planning, manipulator design,                
              end-effector design, robot dynamics, simulation, and real-time                 
              control.  The graphics workstations and robot arms are                         
              networked to allow uses such as a complete CAD modeling,                       
              optimization, and simulation of a robotic application followed                 
              by downloading of software to control the robot arms for task                  
              execution.
