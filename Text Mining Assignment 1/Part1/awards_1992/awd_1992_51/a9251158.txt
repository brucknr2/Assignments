Abstract    :
              This project is addressing the need to strengthen the Pre-                     
              calculus and Calculus I courses offered to freshman and                        
              sophomore students.  Computer laboratory experiences are                       
              providing students the opportunity to gain an enriched and                     
              comprehensive understanding of mathematics.  The project                       
              results will be disseminated through workshops, seminars, and                  
              conferences to all university institutions of the Island.  The                 
              material produced for the laboratory activities is being                       
              written in Spanish and could be used by other hispanic students                
              in the United States.
