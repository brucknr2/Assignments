Abstract    :
              The Department of Chemistry is integrating the applications of                 
              computer interfacing and computer modeling throughout the                      
              curriculum. Data acquisition systems are being used in the                     
              accelerated general chemistry and junior level physical                        
              chemistry laboratories. Molecular modeling applications start                  
              in the first-year course and extend through the whole                          
              curriculum.
