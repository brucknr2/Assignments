Abstract    :
              The Department of Chemistry is purchasing a Fourier transform                  
              IR spectrometer to introduce the principles of spectroscopy to                 
              first-year students and incorporate its use throughout the                     
              curriculum.  New experiments demonstrating spectrophotometric                  
              applications in analytical, physical, inorganic, and quantum                   
              chemistry are being developed.  The instrument is also being                   
              used extensively by undergraduates conducting independent                      
              research projects.
