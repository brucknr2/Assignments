Abstract    :
              Undergraduate students at the Chemical Engineering Department                  
              of Clarkson University experiment with microcontamination                      
              control, particularly as it applies to gas filtration.                         
              Students work with particle size distributions and statistical                 
              data analysis, measuring and controlling particles smaller than                
              one micrometer.  The techniques and nomenclature learned in                    
              this experiment aid students in such broad fields as pollution                 
              control and industrial hygiene, and also give them specific                    
              insight into the concerns of the microelectronics industry.                    
              The major cause of low manufacturing yields in microelectronics                
              production is the device failures produced by                                  
              microcontamination.  As devices with smaller critical                          
              dimensions are produced the problems posed by submicron                        
              particle contamination will increase.  The new equipment in                    
              this laboratory experiment includes a laser light scattering                   
              particle counter, a condensation nucleus counter, a laminar air                
              flow clean hood, ultraclean stainless steel tubing, valves,                    
              regulators, and filter housings, and a computer for data                       
              logging.
