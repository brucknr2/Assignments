Abstract    :
              The Department of Chemistry is purchasing a near infrared                      
              spectrophotometer for use in a new senior level course in                      
              process analytical chemistry.  Undergraduate chemists and                      
              chemical engineers work together as a team to solve realistic                  
              problems in a simulated process environment to understand the                  
              mechanisms by which the chemical industry seeks to maximize                    
              efficiency and output while minimizing production costs and                    
              waste.  The students explore such topics as sampling in the                    
              industrial environment, chemometrics and the design of flow                    
              systems for online analyses.
