Abstract    :
              Arkansas College has created a computing laboratory consisting                 
              of a network of nine microcomputers located in the experimental                
              physics laboratory, and the created a new experimental physics                 
              curriculum for first and second-year science majors.  The goal                 
              of these laboratories is to teach experimental physics and                     
              computer use in science concurrently by use of a thematic                      
              curriculum with special emphasis on the study of oscillatory                   
              and resonant systems using computer interfaced sensors.  Most                  
              important physical laws apply to oscillators, so the narrowing                 
              of breadth in the course is minimal, while the depth has been                  
              greatly increased.  The laboratory exercises used have been                    
              chosen in this way to focus the students attention on                          
              confirmation, analysis, and interpretation of results;                         
              therefore, we have eliminated many standard laboratory                         
              exercises which served only to demonstrate the correctness of                  
              material covered in the lecture.The motivation for this                        
              approach lies in the faculty's belief that teaching the                        
              experimental method in science is a most important task, and                   
              therefore the laboratory should not merely be used to support                  
              the teaching of theory.  Students must be able to observe and                  
              experience physical phenomena in a way that develops and                       
              enhances both their senses of observation and their reasoning                  
              ability.  The students use the computers to collect and analyze                
              data, perform error analysis on the data, prepare graphical                    
              presentations of their results, compare their results with                     
              software simulations of the experiments and with calculations                  
              based on theory, and prepare their laboratory reports.
