Abstract    :
              A computer laboratory is being developed for students in third                 
              semester calculus and differential equations. The laboratory is                
              based upon Mathematica and makes use of NEXT Computers.                        
              Students attend three lectures a week and then a two hour                      
              "closed" laboratory. The computer laboratories are a means of                  
              enriching the ideas presented in lectures and provide an                       
              opportunity for students to study at length the implications                   
              and possibilities of these ideas since the tedious time                        
              consuming calculations are relegated to the computer.
