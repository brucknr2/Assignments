Abstract    :
              This project will create a laboratory-based polymer chemistry                  
              course for advanced chemistry majors.  The equipment to be                     
              acquired includes a gel permeation chromatograph (GPC) a                       
              Digital Viscometer, a constant temperature viscometer bath, and                
              accessories for a thermomechanical analyzer.  The                              
              instrumentation requested will serve with existing equipment as                
              the instrumental basis for a newly offered polymer chemistry                   
              laboratory/lecture course.  A large proportion of the                          
              experiments in the course will use the equipment for polymer                   
              physical property measurements and polymer characterization.                   
              Further, the equipment will be utilized in instrumental                        
              analysis, and three physical chemistry laboratory courses.
