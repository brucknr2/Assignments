Abstract    :
              The ease of sample and data handling, the sensitivity, and the                 
              speed of use of Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectrometry                 
              will improve the general, analytical, organic, instrumental,                   
              and physical chemistry laboratories.  The diffuse reflectance                  
              and attenuated total internal reflectance accessories will                     
              allow the students to analyze films, powders, pastes, gels, and                
              aqueous protein solutions.  The capability of analyzing this                   
              wide range of materials will make FTIR a workhorse instrument                  
              for a new environmental program and for Senior research                        
              projects.  These improvements will affect an increasing number                 
              of science majors who are training for careers in secondary                    
              education and in the environmental fields, and a significant                   
              number of non-science majors who are environmental science                     
              minors and who are going into business, law, and teaching                      
              professions.
