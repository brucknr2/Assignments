Abstract    :
              This project is improving the Kirkwood Community College                       
              physics curriculum by emphasizing laboratory experiences that                  
              unify content and methodology.  Specifically:  1) laboratory                   
              experiences emphasize the time variable as a unifying concept;                 
              2) laboratory and lecture topics are being more closely linked;                
              3) students are using only a few data gathering instruments and                
              data analysis methods for many experiments throughout the                      
              course; and 4) physics data analysis software is the same as                   
              that being used in mathematics and engineering courses.This                    
              improvement in physics laboratories is being accomplished with                 
              the purchase of three IBM computers with velocity, temperature,                
              force transducers, and real-time interfaces.This project is                    
              significant because it provides conceptual unity, unity in                     
              laboratory instrumentation and unity in data analysis                          
              techniques.  The instrumentation is facilitating data gathering                
              and analysis so students are able to concentrate on                            
              experimental design, problem-solving and understanding                         
              concepts.
