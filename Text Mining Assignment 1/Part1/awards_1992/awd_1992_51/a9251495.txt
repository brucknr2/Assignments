Abstract    :
              This project will establish a machine intelligence laboratory                  
              to be utilized to strengthen the undergraduate program by                      
              directly supporting hands-on experience in two new machine                     
              intelligence courses: Introduction to Machine Intelligence and                 
              Expert Systems: Principles and Applications.  In addition,                     
              undergraduates from other departments will benefit through the                 
              opportunity to apply expert system technology in their                         
              disciplines.                                                                   
                                                                                             
              The laboratory equipment being acquired consists of a network                  
              of ten SUN workstations, two acting as file servers and the                    
              other eight as economical diskless nodes.  Interface technology                
              including TV cameras and digital scanners are connected to the                 
              network.  Software running on the machines includes a mixture                  
              of public domain and commercial software implementing vision                   
              analysis tools, a neural network visualization tool and a                      
              variety of commercial expert system shells.  The combination of                
              innovative software, powerful workstations and modern interface                
              equipment will provide an effective and important environment                  
              for the hands-on projects and assignments of the new courses.
