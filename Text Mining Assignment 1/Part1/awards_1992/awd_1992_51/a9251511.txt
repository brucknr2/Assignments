Abstract    :
              The goal of the project is to expand and improve the existing                  
              curriculum and teaching capabilities in computer-assisted                      
              cartography, geographic information systems (GIS) and remote                   
              sensing in the Department of Geography,  University of Idaho.                  
              The new laboratory equipment includes PC workstations, data                    
              input and output devices (digitizers and plotters) and a local                 
              area network to provide transfer capability of files from IBM                  
              compatible workstations to Macintosh workstations as well as                   
              with the campus-wide electronic network.  This will provide a                  
              versatile laboratory for undergraduate instruction in computer                 
              assisted geographic information technologies.  A series of lab                 
              sessions based on the proposed equipment has been designed that                
              will address a missing component of the curriculum, learning                   
              and mastering tools and skills to address theoretical problems                 
              and applied techniques needed in the present computer-aided job                
              market.  The laboratory improvement is part of a larger                        
              development program for the College of Mines and Earth                         
              Resources.
