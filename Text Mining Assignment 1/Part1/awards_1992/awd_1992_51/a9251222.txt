Abstract    :
              This project involves upper division molecular biology students                
              in growing, maintaining and then investigating transfected                     
              mammalian tissue cultures.  The equipment includes: a                          
              refrigerated tabletop centrifuge, a Labconco Safety Cabinet and                
              a VWR carbon dioxide incubator.  Students work in small groups                 
              with the assignment of transfecting a cloning vector containing                
              the ETn gene into murine plasmacytoma P3 cells and then                        
              identifying the insertion sites.  The course involves                          
              considerable student independent work and the use of a variety                 
              of techniques.
