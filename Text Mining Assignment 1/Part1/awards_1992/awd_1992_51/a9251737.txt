Abstract    :
              A model laboratory is being developed which will enable                        
              individuals who are preparing to be elementary school teachers                 
              to undertake realistic, hands-on mathematics and science                       
              experiences. The laboratory is making both computer related                    
              technology equipment and hands-on mathematics and science                      
              equipment available to preservice teachers. The equipment is                   
              providing students with the opportunity to explore, analyze,                   
              construct models, collect and represent data, and solve                        
              problems in realistic situations. The laboratory is providing                  
              a model for how preservice teachers can use specific scientific                
              equipment and technology in their own work with students.
