Abstract    :
              The aim of the project is to enable the Department of Political                
              Science to offer a creative and engaging capstone course,                      
              Policy Perspectives, to all majors, which can become a model                   
              for political science departments in other universities                        
              interested in developing such an integrative experience.   The                 
              courses goals are twofold: to provide students an opportunity                  
              to apply the methodological skills and substantive knowledge                   
              which they have acquired in previous coursework in the                         
              discipline and to hone their analytical and critical skills, so                
              that they can compete more effectively for seats in graduate                   
              school and positions in the private and public sector.  A key                  
              audience of the course is African-American students, who                       
              presently comprise 20% of the majors.
