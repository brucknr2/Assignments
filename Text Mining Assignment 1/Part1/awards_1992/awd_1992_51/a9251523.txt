Abstract    :
              The goal of the project is to increase awareness among social                  
              science majors of international relations and foreign policy                   
              decision-making.  Undergraduate students at the University of                  
              Connecticut participate in the simulation by communicating                     
              through a central computer located at the University of                        
              Maryland via electronic mail and a real-time teleconferencing                  
              network.The International Communication and Negotiation                        
              Simulation offers students the opportunity to learn the                        
              principles of international negotiations: how to bargain, when                 
              to compromise, what are the risks and who will benefit.  To be                 
              effective, the students must learn the importance of teamwork                  
              and specialization.  Political scientists at the University of                 
              Connecticut will also use the microcomputer-simulation facility                
              to assist in the introduction of more international studies                    
              into the state high school social studies program. The initial                 
              phase of the project will involve high school students working                 
              on simulation exercises in collaboration with undergraduates at                
              the University of Connecticut
