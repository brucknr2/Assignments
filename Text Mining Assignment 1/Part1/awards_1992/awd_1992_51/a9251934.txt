Abstract    :
              Undergraduate Control Systems Design Laboratory                                
              This project will upgrade an undergraduate control laboratory                  
              by adding new experiments and introducing the students to a                    
              digital computer program (LabView) that allows data                            
              acquisition, analysis, display, and real-time control functions                
              to be integrated into a single digital computer (a MAC IIsi).                  
              The LabView virtual instrument software allows the MAC computer                
              to act as a variety of laboratory instruments.                                 
                                                                                             
              The digital computer will also contain the MATLAB computer                     
              program with the control systems toolbox for off-line                          
              simulation, analysis and design.  The combinations of the MAC                  
              II with the LabVIEW and MATLAB software creates a control                      
              systems workstation that gives the students access to state-of-                
              the-art tools.                                                                 
                                                                                             
              The funds awarded in this project provide for acquisition of                   
              MAC IIsi computers, data-acquisition boards, and software.  The                
              funding will allow the institution to complete the upgrade, add                
              new systems to be controlled, expand the types of experiments                  
              being conducted, and introduce the students to modern control                  
              engineering workstations and software.
