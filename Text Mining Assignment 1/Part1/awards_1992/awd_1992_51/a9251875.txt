Abstract    :
              Microcomputers and software, and equipment to measure                          
              respiratory metabolism enhance investigative, hands-on                         
              laboratory experiments in undergraduate physiology                             
              laboratories.  Digital recording of physiological responses of                 
              human subjects and animal preparations captured on the computer                
              enable students to visualize, analyze, and interpret data.                     
              Experiments using an open-flow metabolism system extends                       
              student understanding of animal and human energetics and                       
              respiratory metabolism.
