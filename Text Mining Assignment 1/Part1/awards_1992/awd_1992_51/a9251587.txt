Abstract    :
              The Chemistry Department is purchasing a nitrogen/dye laser, a                 
              scanning monochromator, and a photomultiplier tube for use in                  
              physical chemistry and undergraduate research.  The system is                  
              being used to introduce Raman spectroscopy, laser-induced                      
              fluorescence, phosphorescence, and fast kinetics to students in                
              Physical Chemistry Laboratory.  Students are learning to                       
              combine laser technology with other modern techniques such as                  
              computer interfacing and theoretical quantum mechanical                        
              calculations as an introduction to research.  The equipment is                 
              also  to students participating in undergraduate research.
