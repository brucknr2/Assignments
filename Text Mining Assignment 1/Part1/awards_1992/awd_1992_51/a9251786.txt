Abstract    :
              This project at the University of California, Berkeley, affects                
              almost all of the undergraduate statistics courses, with a                     
              total yearly enrollment of about 3,000 students.  There are two                
              critical instructional areas--understanding of data and                        
              statistical procedures as applied to data, and the                             
              understanding of probabilistic concepts.  The purpose of the                   
              project is to encourage intuition and understanding by using                   
              computing as an empirical tool to link together different views                
              of data and give dynamic illustrations of important probability                
              theorems.
