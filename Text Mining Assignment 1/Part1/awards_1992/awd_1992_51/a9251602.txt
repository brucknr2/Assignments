Abstract    :
              The mathematical capabilities of undergraduate students is                     
              being enhanced by integrating graphical, numeric, and symbolic                 
              mathematical software across a broad spectrum of the                           
              mathematical sciences curriculum.  This is a part of a long-                   
              term plan to integrate state-of-the-art mathematical and                       
              statistical problem-solving tools into the undergraduate                       
              curriculum.
