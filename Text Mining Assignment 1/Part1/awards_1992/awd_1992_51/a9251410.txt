Abstract    :
              The Mechanical Engineering Department at the University of                     
              Wisconsin-Milwaukee has developed a unique university-industry                 
              laboratory experience for its senior students.  This laboratory                
              course is unusual in that it is not concerned with a series of                 
              rigid experiments that is repeated each semester but rather                    
              deals with experiments periodically solicited from local and                   
              national industries.  Participating industries contribute                      
              state-of-the-art experimental problems plus the equipment to be                
              investigated (usually part of their product line), and, in                     
              return, they receive a copy of the completed student laboratory                
              report. The project will allow the expansion of this effective                 
              and successful course into the complex field of high speed                     
              dynamic measurements.  This enhanced laboratory experience will                
              help to educate new engineers with up-to-date knowledge and                    
              competence with high-speed measurement methods.
