Abstract    :
              The Interactive Mathematics Text Project (IMTP) of the                         
              Mathematics Association of America has as its goal the                         
              increased use of interactive texts in mathematics education.                   
              To this end, the IMTP provides instruction to potential authors                
              of texts and provides support to selected developers of these                  
              texts.  The IMTP has established six sites located throughout                  
              the country at two and four year colleges.  Individuals will be                
              selected from the IMTP workshop attendees during the summer of                 
              1992 and again during the summer of 1993 to continue work on                   
              their text.  Proposed are three conferences to bring together                  
              text developers, experts on the various authoring platforms,                   
              and IMTP Advisory Board members.  At these conferences the                     
              developers will have the opportunity of collaborating with each                
              other.  The goal of this project is the completion of a minimum                
              of ten texts and an increase in the pool of potential                          
              interactive text authors.
