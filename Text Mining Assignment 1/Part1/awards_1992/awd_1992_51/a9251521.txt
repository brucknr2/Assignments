Abstract    :
              This project develops a laboratory for parallel processing                     
              equipped with a 32-processor network of transputers, which can                 
              be partitioned to serve four users simultaneously.  An                         
              additional transputer runs the software for partitioning and                   
              reconfiguring the system; reconfiguration is under the control                 
              of the users.  The network of processors (or a subset) can be                  
              configured into a variety of architectures, such as a pipe, a                  
              tree, a HyperCube, a mesh and a torus.  This equipment will                    
              first be used in the laboratory portions of three courses:                     
              Programming Language Concepts, Design and Analysis of                          
              Algorithms, and Computer Architecture.  Later, this equipment                  
              and a network of workstations running the Mach OS will be used                 
              to explore parallelism in the introductory sequence of courses                 
              and in Computer Organization and Operating Systems.  The                       
              parallel machine will also be used by students who are doing                   
              senior thesis in parallel computation.
