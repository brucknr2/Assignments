Abstract    :
              Laboratories in Anatomy and Physiology courses are expanded in                 
              scope and breadth by computer-based technology designed to                     
              gather and analyze physiological data.  Students measure and                   
              analyze data related to the cardiovascular, respiratory,                       
              skeletal, muscular and nervous systems.  Equipment includes                    
              Macintosh LC microcomputers, multi-channel analyzers, isolated                 
              square wave stimulators, and printers, interfaced with                         
              Inteletool Physiogrip, Cardiocomp, Flexicomp, Spirocomp,                       
              Intelipulse, and Digestion- Nutrition systems.
