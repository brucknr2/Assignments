Abstract    :
              Fundamentals of Plant Physiology, and other allied courses that                
              use plant physiology instrumentation, now feature modern                       
              equipment used to encourage inquiry based learning. The Plant                  
              Physiology course is designed for a mixture of non-majors,                     
              majors, and pre-service teachers.  Computer interfaced                         
              equipment includes oxygen electrodes, a gas chromatograph, and                 
              photometers, leaf area meters and spectroradiometers.  The                     
              class analyzes the effects of various parameters on gas                        
              exchange and photosynthesis, photobiology, nitrogen metabolism                 
              and respiration.
