Abstract    :
              This project uses a closed-loop, servohydraulic system to                      
              enhance the quality of laboratory instruction in three required                
              undergraduate courses in the School of Civil Engineering at the                
              Georgia Institute of Technology: Materials of Construction,                    
              Physical Properties of Soils and Rocks, and Experimental                       
              Structural Analysis.  The equipment provides these classes with                
              a state-of-the-art, computer controlled system capable of                      
              applying cyclic loads, and allows the students to perform                      
              critical and innovative experiments on conventional and                        
              emerging materials. The new experiments emphasize tests                        
              involving fatigue and cyclic behavior of conventional and new                  
              engineering materials such as plastics and high-strength                       
              fiber-reinforced composites.  Repair and rehabilitation methods                
              and the testing of connections are included in the experimental                
              program.  Students are also exposed to techniques for field                    
              testing of soils that are important to geotechnical site                       
              assessments.  The system is similar to state-of-the-art                        
              equipment that students will most likely encounter in industry                 
              after graduation.
