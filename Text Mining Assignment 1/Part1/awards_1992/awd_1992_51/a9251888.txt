Abstract    :
              The increasing use of microprocessors to sense and control                     
              processes in our environment makes the study of interfacing of                 
              computers to external devices an important part of an                          
              undergraduate computer science curriculum.  In this project,                   
              students will design a set of experiments to illustrate the                    
              principles of computer interfacing for dynamic sensing and                     
              control purposes.  The interface system will allow the students                
              to substitute virtual (i.e., simulated) instruments for real                   
              instruments, and thereby process real data signals.  Each                      
              student workstation will have a Macintosh IIsi equipped with an                
              interface board that permits the reading of voltage signals                    
              from the sensors in the outside world, as well as the control                  
              of experiments in that world through signals sent to the                       
              control devices.  The students will wire-up icons representing                 
              the virtual instruments on the screen, thereby producing a                     
              sophisticated signal-processing system to analyze and display                  
              dynamic data.
