Abstract    :
              The aquatic sciences program at Grand Valley State has had a                   
              far reaching impact on the regional knowledge of aquatic                       
              resources, and science in general.  To improve the educational                 
              level of students majoring in biology, with an emphasis in                     
              aquatic science, new equipment for hands-on investigation is                   
              essential  The equipment requested in this proposal is for use                 
              in laboratory and student research projects designed to develop                
              logical thinking skills.  Students will take a very active role                
              in data collection, analysis, and interpretation. K-12 students                
              and teachers and lay persons in the community will also benefit                
              from the use of this equipment.
