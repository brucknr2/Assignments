Abstract    :
              This project will permit the acquisition of the equipment and                  
              software necessary to implement  the use of advanced                           
              Engineering Design Graphics tools throughout the Civil                         
              Engineering curriculum. These second generation tools integrate                
              design drafting and analytical engineering. They are defined as                
              modern Engineering Design Graphics (EDG) tools. These tools                    
              allow designers to draw three-dimensional models of their                      
              designs and then conduct complicated analyses on those models                  
              using automated routines that are available within the Computer                
              Aided Engineering software package. Undergraduate engineering                  
              students use EDG tools and employ the EDG tools as the focal                   
              point for collaborative learning exercises throughout the four-                
              year curriculum.  Freshmen are taught the mechanics of using                   
              the tools in a new course, Modern Computer Graphics.  They then                
              apply their modeling skills in  other classes throughout the                   
              balance of their work at the school. Seven additional courses                  
              are enhanced with experiments and demonstrations using the new                 
              equipment.  In a senior-level systems design course, the new                   
              tools serve as the focal point for a semester-long exercise in                 
              collaborative learning.
