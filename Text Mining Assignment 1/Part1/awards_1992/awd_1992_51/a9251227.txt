Abstract    :
              The principle objective of this project is to introduce new                    
              state-of-the-art laser vibrometry and PC-based instrumentation                 
              technology into the undergraduate laboratory curriculum in the                 
              area of Mechanical Vibrations.  The experiments introduced into                
              the courses are of a fundamental and design application nature.                
              Labs are conducted in which concepts such as natural frequency,                
              mode shapes, resonance, Bode plots, and aerodynamically induced                
              vibrations of flexible structures are introduced.  A rotor                     
              vibrations lab is introduced in which the students measure the                 
              vibration of turbine blades while the rotor is spinning at a                   
              high rate of speed.  A design lab is introduced in which the                   
              students are asked to eliminate the noise produced by a                        
              cellular phone antenna mounted on the rear window of a car.                    
              The equipment to be installed in the new labs includes laser                   
              vibrometers, Bentley Nevada rotor kits, and PC-based hardware                  
              and software for real-time Fast Fourier Transform and                          
              Oscilloscope instrumentation.
