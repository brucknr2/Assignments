Abstract    :
              A computer lab/classroom in which all students in all                          
              appropriate upper-level mathematics courses at Franklin College                
              are being provided with daily computer access, with the                        
              software program, Mathematica, providing a common thread                       
              throughout these courses.  The development of curriculum                       
              materials for the project has already been funded through a                    
              Curriculum Development Grant from the Lilly Endowment, Inc.                    
              This program, based on incorporating the principles of                         
              discovery learning and collaborative learning into the daily                   
              classroom activities, has been built by starting with the                      
              introduction of a laboratory component into the freshman                       
              calculus sequence, continuing with the implementation of                       
              computer-based activities into many upper-level courses.  The                  
              equipment provided allows the program to develop a coherent                    
              overall structure so that it can provide a model of program                    
              integration for other colleges to follow.
