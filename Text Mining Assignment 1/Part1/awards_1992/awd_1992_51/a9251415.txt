Abstract    :
              Introduction to Technical WritingThis project is designed to                   
              significantly improve the introductory physics laboratory at                   
              Saint Anselm College.  It has two specific aims:  1) new sets                  
              of experiments allow engineering students and biology students                 
              to follow distinct pathways, each suited to the later academic                 
              and professional emphases of the individual; and 2) new                        
              computer facilities, both hardware and software, allow a new                   
              and more modern emphasis on data processing and data analysis,                 
              together with special attention to technical writing skills.                   
              The introductory physics laboratory is a combined one - it                     
              handles students from the calculus-based course (engineering                   
              and chemistry students) and from the algebra based course                      
              (biology students).  The new two-path concept exposes                          
              engineering students to experiments dealing with  properties of                
              materials, aerodynamics, and the Stirling engine.  The biology                 
              students follow a track intended to achieve a firm grounding in                
              x-ray properties.  The new computer facilities equip an already                
              existing suite of rooms where students gather for study, and                   
              pre- and post-lab work.  The laboratory reports stress modern                  
              technical communications skills, both as to content and form.
