Abstract    :
              The Department of Chemistry is purchasing spectrometers,                       
              computers and associated instrumentation to automate data                      
              collection in several lower and upper division laboratory                      
              courses.  The new equipment is providing students with an                      
              increased opportunity to engage in experimental design and                     
              conduct open-ended investigations.  The instrumentation is also                
              being used by advanced undergraduates undertaking independent                  
              research.
