Abstract    :
              This project improves the laboratory portion of the Animal                     
              Tissue Culture course, facilitating addition of two new                        
              laboratory exercises.  The equipment acquired includes a modern                
              biological safety cabinet, a carbon dioxide incubator, and a                   
              liquid nitrogen freezer.  New exercises added to the course                    
              include the karyotyping of human cultured cells and the                        
              oncogenic transformation of normal chicken embryo fibroblasts                  
              by Rous sarcoma virus.  Students observe the initiation of the                 
              transformed phenotype and compare properties of normal and                     
              transformed cells.
