Abstract    :
              This project grows out of curricular needs in cell and                         
              molecular biology, environmental science, and student research.                
              A partnership with International Business Machine will assist                  
              in developing the project.  The Division of Natural Sciences                   
              has been funded to build a multi-functional facility comprising                
              a network that will tie together a central computer classroom                  
              with a series of laboratory satellite stations. Using computer-                
              assisted instrumentation, this project will enhance our                        
              curriculum in four ways:  (1) upgrade our offerings in the                     
              structural/functional aspects of cell biology from a                           
              descriptive to an analytical approach to biological principles;                
              (2) enhance the analytical and conceptual quality of research                  
              opportunities for undergraduates via our required, year-long,                  
              Senior Project, in a way that will expand the principles that                  
              can be addressed and introduce students to modern                              
              instrumentation;  (3) allow the use of analytical microscopical                
              techniques appropriate for students concentrating in ecological                
              and environmental biology;  and (4) allow active participation                 
              in computer-controlled data collection and analysis with an                    
              integrated system in which students collect data and digitize                  
              images in a microscopy laboratory and prepare analyses and                     
              reports in the computer classroom.
