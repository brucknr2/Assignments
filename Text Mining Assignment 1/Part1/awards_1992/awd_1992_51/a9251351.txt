Abstract    :
              This project is to improve and upgrade the optics laboratory                   
              experiences for physics students at St. Mary's University by                   
              enabling our students to measure intensity and polarization in                 
              addition to the geometrical properties of light, work with                     
              lasers and interferometers and perform some two-dimensional                    
              image processing.  Hands-on experience with modern equipment at                
              the college level is particularly important for our students,                  
              a predominant percentage of whom are minority Hispanics who                    
              come from high schools having limited physics courses with                     
              poorly equipped laboratories.  Optics has been chosen for                      
              improvement at this time because other parts of the physics                    
              laboratory curriculum have received some update and improvement                
              during the past several years.  The equipment purchased                        
              includes eight optics systems, each with laser and                             
              interferometer, provide the means to study traditional                         
              properties of light.  A microwave set has been obtained to                     
              demonstrate optical phenomenon with three cm waves.  The 386 SX                
              computers equip our students to explore automatic data                         
              collection and online data analysis as well as to perform image                
              processing.  The instruments acquired allow these students to                  
              perform experiments at a level that increases their interest in                
              physical science and encourages participation in science beyond                
              the introductory level.
