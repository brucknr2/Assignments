Abstract    :
              The Department of Chemistry is establishing an Undergraduate                   
              Program in Computational Chemistry is providing advanced                       
              molecular modeling capabilities enabling undergraduates to                     
              explore complex molecular structures and the structure-function                
              relationships inherent in inter-molecular interactions.                        
              Molecular modeling is becoming an integral part of the junior                  
              level organic chemistry course and the focus of the senior                     
              bioorganic course.  The facility is also being used extensively                
              by undergraduates enrolled in quantum chemistry to examine how                 
              the relation between quantum mechanics and molecular structure                 
              is reflected in rotational, vibrational, electronic and                        
              magnetic resonance spectra.
