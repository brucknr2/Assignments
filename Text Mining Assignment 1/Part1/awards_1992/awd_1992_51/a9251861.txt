Abstract    :
              A high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) system is being                   
              purchased by the Departments of Chemistry and Biology for use                  
              in several courses in the undergraduate curriculum, including                  
              a new program in environmental analysis.  The instrument                       
              includes a gradient delivery system, a computer workstation, an                
              autosampler, an ultraviolet detector, a fluorescence detector                  
              and columns.  A special course in the use of HPLC provides                     
              students with the opportunity to study the principles and                      
              applications of HPLC in environmental analysis, specifically                   
              the detections and quantization of priority pollutants.  The                   
              increased need for environmental impact studies and                            
              environmental monitoring due to state and Federal regulations                  
              has resulted in a demand for graduates trained in the specific                 
              analytical techniques of environmental analysis.
