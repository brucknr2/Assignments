Abstract    :
              This project provides a tabletop ultracentrifuge to be used in                 
              two laboratory courses (Cell and Molecular Biology, and                        
              Introduction to Science Techniques) which form the core of a                   
              recently revised curricula in biology and biochemistry.  The                   
              courses are designed to provide students with a foundation in                  
              the theoretical basis of research techniques and to demonstrate                
              that a variety of research methods are integrated during the                   
              conduct of a scientific investigation.  This instrument will                   
              also facilitate departmental projects involving students in                    
              independent research.  Additionally, college workshops for                     
              advanced high school students and secondary school teachers, as                
              well as non-major science offerings, will use this equipment.
