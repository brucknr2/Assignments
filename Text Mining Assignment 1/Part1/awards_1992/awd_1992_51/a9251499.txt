Abstract    :
              This project introduces undergraduate students to the important                
              measuring technique of laser-doppler velocimetry (LDV) which is                
              now widely used in industry, especially for turbulence                         
              measurement. The project employs a single-channel system for                   
              use in a small water-flow test rig.  For safety and for ease of                
              setting up, the system uses a fiber-optic probe, which holds                   
              the main optics, permanently adjusted, in a self-contained                     
              unit.  The laser power is 7mW, but the effective laser power                   
              for safety considerations is 3.5mW. Students ise the system                    
              first in the Introductory Fluids Engineering course (a combined                
              lecture and laboratory class) and use it for more detailed                     
              measurements in the senior year Thermosciences Laboratory                      
              course.
