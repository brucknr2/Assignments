Abstract    :
              Ten experimental workstations are being used by 250 first year                 
              mostly minority students who are engineering, science and pre-                 
              health professions majors at the New Brunswick campus of                       
              Rutgers, the State University of New Jersey.  These stations                   
              are the center piece of an innovative Gateway Physics Program                  
              which is being created to enable underprepared students from                   
              hard pressed urban school districts to succeed in their initial                
              year at Rutgers.  The program is built around a state-of-the-                  
              art facility based on the Flexible Education Module pioneered                  
              by one of the P.I.'s.
