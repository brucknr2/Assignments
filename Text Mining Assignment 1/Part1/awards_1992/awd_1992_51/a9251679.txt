Abstract    :
              The acquisition of 12 Transputer Development Systems (with each                
              system having nine transputers) allows the use of parallel                     
              processing laboratory exercises in a Microprocessor System                     
              Design course and also the support of senior-student projects.                 
              The Transputer Development Systems provides an inexpensive but                 
              excellent and effective approach to teaching and experimenting                 
              with parallel processing systems.  By the use of innovative                    
              laboratory exercises (such as solving the mathematical                         
              equivalence of jigsaw puzzles) the Transputer Development                      
              Systems enables students to fully explore the advantages and                   
              pitfalls associated with trying to develop and execute                         
              algorithms on multiple processor systems.  Finally, the                        
              Transputer Development Systems also is being used to support                   
              student Major Qualifying Projects which incorporate substantial                
              parallel-processing capability.
