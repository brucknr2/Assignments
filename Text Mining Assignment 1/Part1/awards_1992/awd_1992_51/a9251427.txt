Abstract    :
              Metabolic, vision, and other ergonomics measurement equipment                  
              is being added to the Ergonomics Laboratory of the Industrial                  
              Engineering program at Bradley University to determine the                     
              physiological cost of work performed by humans.  This project                  
              facilitates the study of human factors in a state-of-the-art                   
              laboratory.  Students are able to investigate how to design                    
              jobs and workplaces to fit human capabilities.  The new                        
              equipment includes a computerized metabolic measurement system                 
              for determining the physiological costs of physical work, a                    
              vision tester for measurement of visual performance, a leg and                 
              arm ergometer for simulating work performed by legs and arms,                  
              and a computerized digital goniometer to measure joint angles                  
              and range of motion.  Laboratory experiments are conducted by                  
              the students as part of their course-work and through                          
              independent studies and projects.
