Abstract    :
              It has been recognized that physics graduates progressing to                   
              careers in experimental physics in industry or to studies for                  
              a higher degree, need on-the-job training in the design and                    
              planning stage of experiments.   More often than not this                      
              training is haphazard, with a good chance that the trainee is                  
              self-taught.  We believe that the education of our majors will                 
              be more complete if their first planning and design assignments                
              are performed with an oversight and feedback from faculty, in                  
              a formal course setting.  To meet this need we have inaugurated                
              an experimental physics design lab for seniors.  A core of                     
              equipment has been assembled for the course, and more apparatus                
              is being brought into the laboratory to bring it to its planned                
              stage.  The main goals of the teaching mode for the course are                 
              to develop initiative, and to instill in the students the need                 
              for sound design and planning of experiments.  The choice of                   
              experiments is based on a number of factors; utilization of a                  
              physical principle or technique of wide applicability,                         
              available equipment, and non-overlap with experiments in                       
              preceding laboratory courses.  The experiments chosen also are                 
              somewhat open-ended, to meet the goals of the teaching mode.
