Abstract    :
              The objective of this project is to provide immunology students                
              with the knowledge, procedures, and equipment to analyze the                   
              humoral immune response as it relates to antigenic challenge                   
              and subsequent antibody analysis.  Students will prepare                       
              bacterial whole cell and cell-free extract soluble antigens for                
              subsequent immunization of  rabbits. During the course of                      
              immune response studies students will gain hands-on experience                 
              with practical immunological techniques including:                             
              1)immunoelectrophoresis; 2)immunodiffusion; 3) immunoblotting;                 
              and 4)enzyme-linked immunoabsorbent assays.  These experimental                
              methods will require the students to think critically about                    
              both the procedures and the analysis of their data.
