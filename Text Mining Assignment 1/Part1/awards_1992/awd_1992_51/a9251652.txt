Abstract    :
              A series of experiments in fiber optic systems and devices  is                 
              being incorporated into a recently introduced undergraduate                    
              lecture/laboratory course on optics and optoelectronic systems.                
                                                                                             
              The experiments divide naturally into three areas:  fiber optic                
              device and component characterization, fiber optic                             
              communications networks, and fiber optic sensors.  The students                
              build ring and star networks and analyze them with an optical                  
              time-domain reflectometer and a bit-error-rate tester.                         
              Wavelength division multiplexing at 1.3m and 1.55m on single-                
              mode fibers is investigated.  Fiber optic sensors based on                     
              microbending, polarization effects, and interferometry are                     
              understood through hands-on experience.
