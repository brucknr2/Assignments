Abstract    :
              This proposal provides equipment (a UV/VIS spectrophotometer                   
              with computer interface, an environmental chamber, temperature-                
              controlled aquaria, a seawater holding system, and computers                   
              with data handling and analysis software) that enable students                 
              in marine biology laboratories to investigate adaptation and                   
              energy expenditures of organisms in relation to changes in                     
              their environments.  The seawater system, in conjunction with                  
              the aquaria, enables the class to use locally collected and                    
              purchased specimens.  Students collect and store data from                     
              instruments directly on the computer; making data acquisition                  
              quicker and allowing students to analyze experiments with                      
              statistically valid sample sizes.Use of the equipment will be                  
              encouraged for all classes needing a seawater supply and animal                
              maintenance facilities.  Experience with modern equipment will                 
              enhance students potential as professionals and during graduate                
              study.
