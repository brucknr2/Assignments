Abstract    :
              A recently initiated undergraduate course in photobiology                      
              includes laboratory work on light transmittance through                        
              biological media, quantum yield calculation,                                   
              photosensitization, photosynthesis, vision, determination of                   
              absorption and action spectra, circadian rhythms,                              
              bioluminescence, and other selected topics.  The equipment                     
              includes a spectrophotometer for determining absorption spectra                
              and performing multicomponent analysis, UV and visible light                   
              sources and a helium-neon laser for illuminating samples, a                    
              monochromator and an array of filters for selecting specific                   
              wavelengths of illumination, and radiometers for measuring                     
              light intensity.
