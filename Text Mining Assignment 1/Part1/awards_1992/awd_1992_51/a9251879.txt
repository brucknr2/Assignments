Abstract    :
              A computer controlled high performance liquid chromatograph                    
              with a multiple wavelength uv-visible detector (HPLC/UV) is                    
              being introduced into the biology and chemistry curricula.                     
              Instruction in the use of chromatographic instrumentation for                  
              environmental and forensic applications is emphasized.  This                   
              instrumentation is used in introductory chemistry courses,                     
              upper-level biology and chemistry courses, and undergraduate                   
              research projects.  Students conduct environmental                             
              investigations analyzing water, soil, sediments, and biota for                 
              agricultural chemicals.  These and other investigations provide                
              an opportunity to compare and contrast HPLC/UV instrumentation                 
              with other techniques as part of the chemistry course on                       
              instrumental methods.
