Abstract    :
              A gas chromatograph/mass spectrometer (GC/MS) will be a central                
              feature of an instrument facility being constructed for the                    
              organic laboratory course.  It will give sophomores first-hand                 
              experience with instrumentation for determination of molecular                 
              structure that will enhance their lecture learning of                          
              structure.  Much of the utilization will involve hands-on use                  
              by students to verify product structure and to determine                       
              structures of unknowns.  This experience and the instrument                    
              capability will enrich the pursuit of research projects of                     
              undergraduates with individual faculty.
