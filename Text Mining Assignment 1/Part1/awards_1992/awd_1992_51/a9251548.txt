Abstract    :
              The aim of the project is to provide a hands-on laboratory                     
              experience to introductory psychology students in the following                
              areas:  animal behavior analysis, perception/cognition,                        
              neuroscience, and developmental psychology. By particpating in                 
              these laboratories both majors and non-majors become familiar                  
              with a variety of research techniques and conceptual issues.                   
              The psychology curriculum is being revised to take advantage of                
              and build upon this early introduction to experimentation and                  
              experimental thinking.
