Abstract    :
              This project will introduce upper level students to the power                  
              and limitations of computational chemistry.  The project will                  
              integrate computational chemistry and computer modeling into                   
              six existing courses rather than adding a new course.  The                     
              exercises make comparisons between predictions of simple                       
              chemical models, sophisticated theoretical calculations and                    
              experimental data.  Recently developed, inexpensive, three-                    
              dimensional color graphic workstations with user-friendly                      
              commercial software make this work possible for a small                        
              department.  Funding will purchase two IRIS Indigo three-                      
              dimensional color workstations, an upgrade of an existing                      
              workstation, two PCs attached as graphic terminals to the                      
              Indigos, networking, printing, and group video resources                       
              combined with two major computational chemistry software                       
              packages.  One package is for molecular mechanics and large                    
              molecule modeling, the other is for performing quantum                         
              chemistry calculations and sophisticated color rendering of the                
              resulting electron distributions and molecular shapes.
