Abstract    :
              An up-to-date undergraduate computer-aided electromagnetics and                
              microwaves laboratory, utilizing computer aided design (CAD)                   
              software, personal computers, and microwave measurement                        
              equipment, is being used by students in the Electrical and                     
              Computer Engineering department at this institution.  The                      
              laboratory allows instruction on design utilizing CAD,                         
              experimentation with automated electromagnetics measurements                   
              and design, and construction of microstrip components.  Certain                
              basic experiments, e.g., slotted line measurements, are not                    
              automated on purpose to enhance the understanding of                           
              fundamentals for the following CAD experience. This laboratory                 
              also supports student involvement with practical and current                   
              design problems, similar to those faced by engineers in an                     
              industrial environment.
