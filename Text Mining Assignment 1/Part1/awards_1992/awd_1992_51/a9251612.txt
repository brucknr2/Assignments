Abstract    :
              This undergraduate plant physiology course now includes a                      
              pressure chamber and osmometer to measure whole leaf water and                 
              osmotic potential, a portable photosynthesis system to measure                 
              carbon dioxide uptake, stomatal conductance, and transpiration,                
              and oxygen electrodes, monitors, and chart recorders to measure                
              respiration and the light reactions of photosynthesis.                         
              Students investigate such relevant questions as the effects of                 
              herbicides and of increasing carbon dioxide concentrations on                  
              plant physiology.
