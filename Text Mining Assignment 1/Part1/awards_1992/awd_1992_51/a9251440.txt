Abstract    :
              This laboratory sequence integrates studies of the behavioral,                 
              electrophysiological, histological, and neurochemical effects                  
              of medial septal lesions in rats.  The course engages students                 
              in experimental design, hypothesis testing, and analysis and                   
              interpretation of data.  Grant related equipment includes the                  
              instrumentation, hardware and software necessary to conduct and                
              analyze passive avoidance behavioral experiments (Reflex-16                    
              instrumentation) and neurochemical analyses (HPLC).  The                       
              project will significantly enhance research opportunities for                  
              a number of young women and provide them with motivation to                    
              pursue careers in the sciences.
