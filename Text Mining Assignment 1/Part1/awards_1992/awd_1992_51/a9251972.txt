Abstract    :
              The Department of Chemistry is acquiring an atomic absorption                  
              spectrophotometer and a diode array spectrophotometer for use                  
              in three introductory chemistry courses.  The atomic absorption                
              unit is being used to determine the concentrations of a variety                
              of metals in materials of environmental origin, such as the                    
              concentration of mercury and lead in the food supply and nickel                
              in alloys.  Following the study of Beer's Law, the diode array                 
              uv/vis spectrophotometer is applied to the determination of                    
              phosphate in water, iron in vitamin supplements, and the study                 
              of buffer behavior.
