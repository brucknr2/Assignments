Abstract    :
              The Department of Chemistry is equipping a scientific graphics                 
              laboratory for the study of computational chemistry in upper                   
              division biochemical, inorganic, and physical chemistry                        
              courses.  The laboratory is having a significant impact on                     
              student understanding of quantum chemistry and molecular                       
              interactions.  The visualization capabilities afford the                       
              students in biochemistry the opportunity to examine                            
              structure:function relationships to an extent which was not                    
              possible previously.
