Abstract    :
              The Department of Chemistry is purchasing a Nitrogen/Dye Laser                 
              to revitalize and improve physical chemistry laboratory.                       
              Physical chemistry students are introduced to basic laser                      
              principles and the uses of the laser in experimental physical                  
              chemistry. Specific experiments conducted by students include                  
              luminescence quenching of ruthenium complexes in aqueous                       
              solution, photochemistry of benzophenone, and the two photon                   
              absorption spectrum of phenanthrene.  In addition,                             
              undergraduate research projects make use of the instrument for                 
              a variety of photochemical investigations.
