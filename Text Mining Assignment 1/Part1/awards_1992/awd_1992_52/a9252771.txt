Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Cleveland Advance Manufacturing Program (CAMP) in                              
              cooperation with Cleveland State University, Case                              
              Western Reserve University, Cuyahoga Community College,                        
              NASA Lewis Research Center local school systems,                               
              professional organizations, businesses and industry                            
              proposes to establish a Comprehensive Regional Center                          
              For Minorities that will provide academic enrichment,                          
              career awareness, and the use of cooperative, hands-on                         
              and research-methodology teaching and learning                                 
              strategies, coupled with a supportive learning                                 
              environment and parental involvement to enhance the                            
              overall educational pathway for precollege science and                         
              mathematics students.  This program, using a HBCU                              
              related model, will build on an existing "Greater                              
              Cleveland Science, engineering an Mathematics Center's                         
              program".  The project is expected to impact                                   
              approximately 1700 minority (mostly African Americans)                         
              students per year.  All of these students will be in a                         
              database that will enable them to be continually                               
              tracked.
