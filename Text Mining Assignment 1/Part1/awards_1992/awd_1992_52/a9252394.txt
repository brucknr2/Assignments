Abstract    :
              Equipment for Undergraduate Instruction: "Engineering                          
              Uncovered"                                                                     
              This project will outfit an exploratory laboratory in a                        
              freshman electrical engineering and computer sciences (EECS)                   
              course begun in Fall 1991. It is believed that these freshmen                  
              can learn much and be motivated by studying equipment and                      
              devices that have been "opened up" for viewing and testing.                    
              The lab presently contains pieces of state-of-the-art                          
              communications, computing, and measuring equipment, such as:                   
              telephones; radio and television receivers; VCR and CD players;                
              an ultrasonic focusing system designed for an instant camera;                  
              and fiber optic communication links.  Inexpensive commercial                   
              multi-experiment electronic kits are also available.  This                     
              grant provides the equipment needed to study the performance of                
              these systems, together with several specialized one-of-a-kind                 
              setups.                                                                        
                                                                                             
              The course of which the lab is a part was constructed in a                     
              modular fashion to permit its being used in EECS by other                      
              instructors and at other schools, and, with changes, in other                  
              fields of engineering.  In particular, it is expected that the                 
              course will be tested in all eight schools of the NSF coalition                
              ("Synthesis:  The NSF Engineering Education Coalition") -- Cal                 
              (Berkeley), Cal Poly (San Luis Obispo), Cornell, Hampton, Iowa                 
              State, Southern University, Stanford, and Tuskegee Institute.
