Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This is a one year MRIA planning grant award.  The project consists            
              of investigating the feasibility of research on intelligent                    
              interfaces based on a user behavior model which emphasizes                     
              individual user differences.  Previous user models have been based             
              on the similarities of the ideal, well-trained user.  A secondary              
              objective of the plan to be investigated is the use of the main                
              results in the area of querying databases, particularly in aiding              
              the user in the formation of queries.  Finally, the project                    
              involves planning on the best approach for an evaluation of the                
              system through testing with actual users of the system.  This                  
              investigation contributes to the understanding of user models and              
              their utility and, in general, to the theory and practice of                   
              interface design.  The preliminary study investigates the most                 
              appropriate architecture for the adaptive user model, the design of            
              the intelligent interface, and the evaluation study.
