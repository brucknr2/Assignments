Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The goal of this project is to produce six additional Jasper                   
              adventures plus video extensions for each adventure, and                       
              relevant print and professional development teacher                            
              materials.  Included with each Jasper adventure will be an                     
              optional piece of software, called the Adventure Maker, that                   
              will allow students to create their own adventures.  In                        
              addition, the adventures and materials will be field tested                    
              in sites across the country.  This series, as with the                         
              previous series, will be designed to be implemented at                         
              various levels of hardware.  It is designed to be used in                      
              conjunction with videodisc technology.  The simplest level                     
              of technology is with a videodisc player and a hand-held                       
              remote; the second level is to use a videodisc player with                     
              barcode; the third level involves computer based control of                    
              the videodisc with hypercard stacks and computational and                      
              graphic tools.  The project has an extensive research                          
              component which includes an analysis of the reactions to                       
              Jasper characters and adventures, an assessment of teachers'                   
              ideas for implementation, expanded assessments of student                      
              learning, studies of the value-added of Jasper software, and                   
              research on the Adventure Maker.
