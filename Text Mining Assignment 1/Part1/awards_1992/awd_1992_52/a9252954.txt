Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The Center for Science, Mathematics and Technology Education                   
              will develop integrated materials for seventh grade students                   
              centered around the topics of biotechnology, manufacturing                     
              and forecasting.  Each unit will include objectives,                           
              experiential learning, appropriate use of multimedia, and                      
              appropriate technology and evaluation instruments.                             
              Attention will be given to preparing materials that motivate                   
              all students, especially those from groups underrepresented                    
              in technological careers, to learn the foundational                            
              mathematics, science and technology concepts by involving                      
              them in enriched learning experiences relevant to their                        
              daily lives.  The materials will be developed together with                    
              teachers, piloted revised, tested, published and                               
              disseminated through a marketing plan supported by a                           
              publisher.  To maximize the potential for long-range impact,                   
              systemic problems that impede the implementation of                            
              integrated materials will be identified and alternate                          
              solutions will be proposed.  Implementation materials will                     
              be developed so that systemic changes can be made and the                      
              materials taught with minimal teacher development.  Student                    
              performance data will be gathered to determine the increase                    
              in achievement in mathematics, science and technology.
