Abstract    :
              The Harvard Calculus Consortium materials are being implemented                
              throughout Arizona, Oklahoma, Utah, and the surrounding                        
              regions. Implementation will be achieved in two complementary                  
              steps.  First, over three years, the coalition (Arizona State                  
              University, Brigham Young University, Northern Arizona                         
              University, Oklahoma State University, and the University of                   
              Arizona) will implement the reformed calculus.  Second, the                    
              coalition activities will be expanded to include other two- and                
              four-year institutions and high schools from the region.  The                  
              three-year plan consists of six parts:  (1) A series of half-                  
              day informational discourses to expose reform calculus to                      
              inform colleagues, members of the client disciplines, high                     
              school teachers, future participants from two- and four-year                   
              institutions.  (2) A series of on-site workshops to train                      
              instructors: full-time faculty, part-time faculty, adjunct                     
              faculty, teaching assistants, and high school teachers.  (3) A                 
              series of on-site workshops to train undergraduate graders and                 
              tutors.  (4) A one-day site-visit with participants each month                 
              during the semester following the workshops.  (5) The                          
              establishment of an electronic mail and bulletin board type                    
              facility for all users of the Harvard Consortium material.  (6)                
              A series of presentations at regional and national professional                
              meetings intended to encourage attendance at either an                         
              informational discourse, or the workshops themselves.
