Abstract    :
              This project improves undergraduate construction education                     
              through the development of a computer-driven video-editing                     
              system which will enable students to collect time-based data                   
              from field operations and analyze it in the laboratory.  The                   
              importance of the system lies in its ability to compress the                   
              playback time and reduce the amount of data viewed to the                      
              required level of detail.  The equipment used for the                          
              development of the above system includes:  (1) a video camera,                 
              (2) two VCRs, (3) an IBM compatible PC, and (4) an erasable                    
              optical disk.  The system is used to provide undergraduates                    
              with direct experience in design and improvement of                            
              construction operations.  Students record construction                         
              operations, develop data for presentations or as input to                      
              simulation models, and prepare recommendations for improvement.
