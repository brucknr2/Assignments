Abstract    :
              The goal of the project is to provide image processing                         
              equipment for use in introductory classes in both the two-year                 
              and four-year degree programs, as well as in advanced classes,                 
              and for undergraduate research projects.  The use of such                      
              equipment will teach students to integrate knowledge gained                    
              from superficially disparate courses, and to encourage them to                 
              synthesize this information to generate unique solutions to                    
              unique problems. This project constitutes a significant                        
              improvement in undergraduate instruction, not just in terms of                 
              the increased scope it affords, but also because of the                        
              cohesiveness it provides.  In this age of ever-increasing                      
              specialization it is imperative that students comprehend the                   
              unifying relationships within the biological sciences.
