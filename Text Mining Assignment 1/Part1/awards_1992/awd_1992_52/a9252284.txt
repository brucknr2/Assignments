Abstract    :
              This proposal will fund the purchase of computer and                           
              acquisition systems for two JEOL FX90Q nuclear magnetic                        
              resonance (NMR) spectrometers for use in undergraduate                         
              laboratories in analytical, physical, and polymer chemistry.                   
              In analytical chemistry, the labs will focus on a basic                        
              familiarity with modern NMR instrumentation.  The students will                
              also learn how to acquire and manipulate data using                            
              computerized equipment.  In physical chemistry, the experiments                
              focus on basic NMR phenomena and second order and exchange                     
              effects.  In polymers, NMR will be used to determine the                       
              stereochemistry, identification, and verification of                           
              polymerization through the use of carbon-13 and proton NMR.                    
              Students will also determine the distribution of monomer                       
              segments in copolymers.  The experiments for the understanding                 
              of the basic Fourier transform NMR phenomena, as well as those                 
              for polymer chemistry, are not generally available for faculty                 
              members in these areas.  These will be developed and shared                    
              with other educators in these fields.
