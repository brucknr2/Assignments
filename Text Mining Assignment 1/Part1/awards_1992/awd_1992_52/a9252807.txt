Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The goals of this Summer Science Camp are to generate and                      
              maintain an interest in science and mathematics among                          
              African-American and Hispanic students and to encourage                        
              them to consider careers in science and mathematics.                           
              Sixty rising seventh-, eighth-, and ninth grade minority                       
              students from Knoxville, Chattanooga, and other areas of                       
              East Tennessee will partricipate in this camp.  The                            
              program foccuses on both life and physical sciencw, thus                       
              exposing them to two major divisions of scientific                             
              inquiry.  Mathematics, as well as other discipline areas,                      
              are integrated into the four-week residential program.                         
              The life science component focuses on population studies;                      
              the physical science component focuses on the science and                      
              mathematics of several aspects of daily living and                             
              recreation.  Biology, mathematics, geology, chemistry,                         
              physics, money management, and nutrition are intgegral                         
              facets of the both project areas.  Students participate                        
              in hands-on research activities interspersed with                              
              discussions related to their activities.  In addition,                         
              students participate in career guidance and counseling                         
              activities, learn to write and present a formal report,                        
              practice good study skills, are exposed to motivational                        
              programs, and interact with  role models from a variety                        
              of settings.  During the four-week camp, activities will                       
              also be offered for parents and siblings.  Instructors                         
              are experienced college and high school staff members,                         
              practicing scientists and mathematicians, and high shcool                      
              students.  Follow-up activities during the academic year                       
              will be on a bi-monthly basis.
