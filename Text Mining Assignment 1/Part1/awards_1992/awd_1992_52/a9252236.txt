Abstract    :
              This project develops an expert system data acquisition and                    
              analysis program for teaching one-dimensional consolidation                    
              testing and triaxial shear testing in the undergraduate soil                   
              mechanics laboratory.  These tests are used to predict the                     
              amount of settlement that foundations will undergo and the                     
              factor of safety against foundation collapse.  Expert systems                  
              are powerful tools with many engineering applications.  The                    
              programs allow students to answer their own questions by using                 
              a mouse and clicking on the screen area hot spots to display                   
              and analyze a problem.  One of the objectives of the project is                
              give undergraduates early exposure to this tool so that they                   
              may develop their own applications once they are part of the                   
              workforce.  This project connects data acquisition and computer                
              equipment to existing laboratory equipment.  The equipment                     
              enables digital loads and displacements to be recorded and                     
              analyzed using the expert systems program.  The expert systems                 
              program uses color screens that depict sketches and equations                  
              relevant to the topics of consolidation and triaxial shear to                  
              assist students in learning these specific topics.
