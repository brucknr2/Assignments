Abstract    :
               A series of laboratory exercises are being developed that                     
              provide students extensive hands-on experience with techniques                 
              that are currently used in cell biology research. The goal of                  
              these exercises is to give students sufficient experience with                 
              these techniques so they can look beyond the techniques and see                
              the principles being examined and practical applications for                   
              these techniques.  To this end, the labs are organized into                    
              mini-project sections lasting two-four weeks.  During each                     
              section, students do several sequential steps on a single                      
              preparation.  Slight variations (e.g., isolation of different                  
              plasmids, assay for different marker enzyme) make the results                  
              of each student unique, providing a sense of discovery and                     
              accomplishment.  Discussion of these results enriches the                      
              overall experience and provides a format for discussing                        
              applications of these techniques.  The coupling of these                       
              techniques to this lab format will help students experience the                
              excitement of scientific research.
