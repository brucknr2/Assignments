Abstract    :
              The Department of Ocean Studies is purchasing a fluorometer and                
              continuous flow analyzer to strengthen the chemistry, marine                   
              studies and field research curricula.  Both instruments are                    
              being in the chemistry, marine science and basic biology                       
              courses enrolling approximately 200 students per year.                         
              Additionally, several dozen students use the equipment each                    
              year on oceanographic research cruises that link course work to                
              field training as marine scientists.
