Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This project is the outgrowth of a series of Teacher                           
              Enhancement workshops that led to the establishment of a                       
              network of science teachers and research scientists.  During                   
              more than four years of teacher-scientist collaborations,                      
              activities using yeast biotechnology have been developed                       
              which engage students in hands-on genetics experiences and                     
              scientific inquiry.  Students are stimulated by their own                      
              ability to generate and investigate questions that concern                     
              them directly; inheritance, biotechnology, radiation                           
              effects, mutations, cancer, nutrition, and more.  Ancillary                    
              materials will include a teacher guide, an electronic                          
              bulletin board system, and videotapes on techniques.  These                    
              materials will be integrated into existing high school                         
              biology courses.
