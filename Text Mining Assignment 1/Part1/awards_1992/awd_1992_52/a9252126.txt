Abstract    :
              The Department of Mathematics and Computer Science is                          
              establishing an Interactive Mathematics Classroom, containing                  
              16 student workstations and one teacher workstation/file                       
              server, all Macintosh Quadra 700s.  The goal of the project is                 
              to have students use the current generation of mathematical                    
              software to gain mathematical intuition and to apply                           
              mathematical theory to realistic problems.  The Classroom is                   
              enabling students to experiment with examples in ways that are                 
              not possible with the traditional pencil-and-paper approach                    
              and, in addition, is allowing those who are being trained as                   
              teachers to gain needed hands-on exposure to mathematical                      
              software.  A unique feature of the Classroom is the network                    
              software, featuring screen sharing as well as file and resource                
              sharing.  This permits automated interaction between instructor                
              and students and high quality access to mathematical software                  
              including Mathematica and MATLAB.  The first classes to use the                
              Interactive Mathematics Classroom are those designed for                       
              prospective K-8 teachers, covering number systems, geometry,                   
              and functions.  In the second year of the project, the                         
              classroom will be used to augment standard mathematics                         
              instruction in linear algebra, differential equations, number                  
              theory, geometry, and linear optimization.
