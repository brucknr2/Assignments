Abstract    :
              The beginning algebra skills class and the first-year calculus                 
              course are being taught with computer classroom instruction as                 
              an integral part of the course beginning with the 1991-92                      
              academic year. The developing courses are focusing on concept                  
              development, understanding, applications, and the use of                       
              technology to enhance learning. Materials being developed as a                 
              part of the Five Colleges Calculus project are being adapted                   
              and site tested as a part of this activity. Approximately 700                  
              students, the majority being female, continuing education and                  
              mathematics education students, are enrolled in mathematics                    
              courses at Aquinas each year and are benefiting from this                      
              laboratory and these approaches.
