Abstract    :
              A classroom with 25 workstations is being created to improve                   
              introductory statistics instruction. Three  changes are being                  
              made in introductory statistics courses: Faculty are using an                  
              interactive classroom approach in teaching statistical                         
              concepts; complex subtasks of an assignment are being developed                
              at the computer under the supervision of the professor; the                    
              full version of SPSS is being used in all statistics courses in                
              order to enable non-science majors to actively use state-of-                   
              the-art computer equipment and software; this classroom lab                    
              permits collaborative learning among the students, replacing                   
              the normal note-taking in lecture courses.
