Abstract    :
              The Department of Chemistry is purchasing a quadrupole mass                    
              spectrometer capable of CI ionization, and GC, LC, DCI and                     
              solid probe sample manipulation.  This instrument is used in                   
              the analytical, organic, and physical chemistry laboratories                   
              and their associated courses.  With a DCI source, students                     
              identify and quantify a variety of solid, liquid, and gaseous                  
              molecular samples not otherwise possible.  As a result,                        
              students acquire a better understanding of molecular structure                 
              and bonding as well as learn up-to-date qualitative and                        
              quantitative analytical techniques required to enter their                     
              respective scientific fields.
