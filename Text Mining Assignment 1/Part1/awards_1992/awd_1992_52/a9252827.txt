Abstract    :
              This Minority Research Initiation Planning Grant will enable                   
              Dr. William Quintana to establish a program studying the                       
              molecular precursors to the ceramic materials BN and B4C. The                  
              object of the work is to discover new synthetic routes for the                 
              efficient production of preceramic materials. Monosubstituted                  
              alkynylborazines will be prepared and studied. The compounds                   
              will be polymerized and charactierized by NMR spectroscopy.                    
              Subsequently they will be decomposed into BN.

              Support from this program will enable Dr. William Quintana to                  
              establish a research program investigating certain polymer                     
              containing boron compounds which can be decomposed into the                    
              ceramic material boron nitride. This compound has considerable                 
              commerical importance because of its physical properties. New,                 
              more efficient routes to its preparation are important to the                  
              chemical industry.
