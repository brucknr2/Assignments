Abstract    :
              A workstation based Creativity Center for interdisciplinary                    
              student design projects is being developed.  Students in                       
              computer science, electrical engineering and mechanical                        
              engineering join together to assist each other in a project                    
              environment emulating the industrial setting.  The equipment                   
              includes RISC/6000 and Macintosh/IIci networked workstations,                  
              peripheral devices and software.  The center provides students                 
              with tools for obtaining a modern design experience relevant to                
              current industrial practice.
