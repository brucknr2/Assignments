Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              In science and mathematics education, leaders agree that                       
              instruction needs to focus more on understanding than                          
              coverage.  There is little evidence however that teachers or                   
              test makers do much directly to promote such higher order                      
              thinking.  To overcome this problem we will work with a high-                  
              stakes test maker to develop outcome measures of higher order                  
              thinking; assist a group of science and mathematics teachers                   
              in preparing assessment strategies which can be used to                        
              promote higher order thinking in their classrooms; study the                   
              effects of those strategies on student performance using the                   
              developed outcome measures and a related high stakes measure;                  
              and develop a teacher assessment inservice package which                       
              illustrates and explains sample classroom assessment                           
              strategies that promote higher order thinking.  The one year                   
              funding allows completion of steps one and two above.                          
                                                                                             
              If test makers see that higher order thinking is being                         
              promoted in the classroom they will emphasize such thinking in                 
              their high-stakes test development.
