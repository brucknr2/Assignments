Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                                                                                            
              Florida State University seeks funds to develop a program for                  
              the mathematics preparation of preservice middle grades                        
              teachers.  The purposes of the project are: to plan and                        
              implement courses in mathematics learning and teaching and                     
              mathematics for prospective middle school mathematics teachers                 
              based on problem-centered learning; to construct a model of                    
              prospective teachers' cognitive operations in learning; and to                 
              develop tasks and protocols for investigating knowledge                        
              structures, beliefs, values, and classroom practices of                        
              prospective middle school mathematics teachers.  Five                          
              mathematics courses and two mathematics education courses will                 
              be revised or designed as a sequence of experiences which                      
              provide opportunities for prospective middle school                            
              mathematics teachers to reflect on mathematical knowledge,                     
              beliefs, and practices.  Using a teaching experiment design,                   
              the proposers will construct explanations and models of                        
              participants' understanding and beliefs about mathematics and                  
              mathematics teaching and learning.    Faculty from the                         
              Mathematics Department and the College of Education will                       
              collaborate to develop the programs.  There is an in-service                   
              component which include area teachers.  The dissemination plan                 
              includes work with other institutions in Florida and faculty                   
              members from the state and the nation.                                         
                                                                                             
              Cost sharing is approximately 10% of the NSF funds.
