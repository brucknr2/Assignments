Abstract    :
              Freshmen at a newly established laboratory in Iowa State                       
              University are using solid modeling and interactive software                   
              for three-dimensional visualization in an active learning                      
              environment for engineering problem solving and technical                      
              communications.  A learning center with 22 personal computers                  
              and appropriate software supports instruction in two                           
              introductory engineering courses.  The learning center                         
              laboratory is used by 36 students at a time, working with 18                   
              networked high-performance personal computers, in two-student                  
              teams.  The teams are engaged in such activities as solid                      
              modeling, geometric analysis, simulation, and documentation.                   
              The two introductory engineering courses most affected by this                 
              laboratory are required of all engineering students and,                       
              together, have a total enrollment of over 2,200 students a                     
              year.
