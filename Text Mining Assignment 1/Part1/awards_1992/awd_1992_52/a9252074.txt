Abstract    :
              New experiments using a molecular beam to explore the kinetic                  
              theory of gases and the concept of temperature will be                         
              developed for the physical chemistry lab.  A relatively simple                 
              apparatus, capable of producing both effusive and supersonic                   
              beams, will be constructed for the project.  The principal                     
              experiment will use time of flight methods to directly verify                  
              the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution of molecular speeds in a                    
              thermal beam.  By examining a series of gases and using                        
              computer aided fitting of their data, students will be able to                 
              verify the dependence of the speed distribution on molecular                   
              mass and temperature.  As an extension of this experiment, the                 
              operating conditions will be modified so that the beam becomes                 
              supersonic.  This leads to a nonthermal speed distribution in                  
              which the beam molecules are not properly characterized by a                   
              temperature.  Observation of this distribution will lead                       
              students to consider the physical meaning of temperature.  The                 
              project provides a demonstration of important classical ideas                  
              in physical chemistry while at the same time exposing students                 
              to modern instrumentation and techniques.
