Abstract    :
              A distributed computing environment for course work and                        
              independent study projects is being developed.  The computing                  
              environment is having a major impact on the upper level                        
              mathematics and computer courses that form the department's                    
              Computer Information Systems major; the environment supports                   
              coursework in distributed data bases, concurrent programming,                  
              multitasking and network operating systems, operations research                
              and mathematical modeling and simulation.  Students  have                      
              access to high performance workstations to study numerical                     
              methods for solving large linear algebraic systems and large                   
              stiff systems of differential equations.
