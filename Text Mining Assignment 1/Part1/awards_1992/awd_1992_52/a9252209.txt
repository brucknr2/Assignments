Abstract    :
              The aim of this project is to provide laboratory instruments                   
              needed for undergraduate electrical engineering students to                    
              work with state-of-the-art circuits and electronic devices;                    
              applications of these high-speed circuits and devices include                  
              communications, computers, consumer products, instrumentation,                 
              and digital signal processing systems.  Existing instruments                   
              are limited to frequency ranges inadequate to permit laboratory                
              teaching to cover currently available components and circuits.                 
              Major items being acquired include high-performance data and                   
              signal generators, high-sample rate digital scopes, RF                         
              impedance measurement system, data analyzer, and high-frequency                
              vector volt meters.Communications, signal processing,                          
              microprocessor applications, instrumentation, and consumer                     
              electronics equipment now operate at frequencies formerly                      
              encountered only in radio transmission.  This project will                     
              provide students with laboratory experience in these growing                   
              areas appropriate to prepare them for professional work in                     
              industry or for further study in graduate school.
