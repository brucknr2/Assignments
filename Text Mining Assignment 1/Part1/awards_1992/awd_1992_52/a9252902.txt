Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This project will produce assessment materials for                             
              mathematics instruction K-12 that have broad national                          
              applicability -- and that serve not only as a means of                         
              measuring student attainment, but also as a positive force                     
              for curriculum change.  The project will have several kinds                    
              of product:                                                                    
                                                                                             
                o  assessment packages for each of three grade ranges that                   
              exemplify national goals and related state guidelines - high                   
              quality, practicality, and balance in terms of nationally                      
              agreed curriculum objectives for mathematics (e.g. those in                    
              the two volumes of NCTM Standards);                                            
              o  explicit curriculum support, including both classroom                       
              materials and professional development resources, to                           
              facilitate the transition, enabling typical teachers to                        
              prepare their students to tackle effectively what are                          
              initially new kinds of task before they take on                                
              comprehensive new curricula;                                                   
              o  active collaborative links between the assessment                           
              designers and those concerned with the design and delivery                     
              of curricula -- national curriculum development projects,                      
              the professional associations, states and others who have                      
              similar curriculum objectives; and                                             
              o  a driving force for curriculum enhancement through the                      
              pressures on the curriculum generated by this assessment,                      
              which will forward national curriculum objectives.                             
                                                                                             
              These products will be developed at three national sites (in                   
              California, Massachusetts, and Michigan) and the Shell                         
              Centre, in active collaboration with NSF-supported                             
              curriculum projects and the related State Departments of                       
              Education.
