Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              BioCom, patterned after ChemCom, will focus on the study of                    
              a few, selected biological concepts in an environmental,                       
              technological and community context.  Students will                            
              investigate an issue, discover appropriate biological                          
              principles and apply their knowledge actively, in context,                     
              allowing them to construct personal meaning in a setting                       
              where their explanation will be revealed.  Students will                       
              investigate, study and analyze what is necessary to resolve                    
              issues in topics including Waste, Energy, Population Limits,                   
              Organismal Maintenance, Population Maintenance, Behavior,                      
              and Evolution.  Project 2061 themes for biology and the                        
              human organism will be covered.  The materials, the                            
              activities, and the ancillaries will be developed by a team                    
              of scientists, biology educators and high school teachers,                     
              guided by a national advisory board.  The units will be                        
              carefully pilot tested and field tested in diverse                             
              locations.  The major products of the project will be a                        
              student textbook, shorter than usual, a teacher edition, a                     
              looseleaf teacher resource book with additional                                
              investigations, project masters, test items, and a high-tech                   
              kit.  The materials will be published by Kendall/Hunt, who                     
              will also support teacher enhancement.
