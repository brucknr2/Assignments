Abstract    :
              We are establishing a microcomputer laboratory to provide                      
              laboratory-based instruction to all majors in critical lower-                  
              level required sociology courses as well as to provide a                       
              variety of opportunities for student research related to New                   
              York City in these and upper-level seminars.  The clustered                    
              workstations permit students to share data and software, and to                
              connect to the Internet via the City University of New York                    
              mainframe.   With this laboratory, we can more effectively                     
              train students in Sociology and empirical social research,                     
              enhance their quantitative and analytic skills, and encourage                  
              as well as equip them for scientific careers, including                        
              teaching.  These are important goals for any student body, but                 
              especially so for minority women who are seriously                             
              underrepresented in science and often hampered in their pursuit                
              of scientific careers by feelings of inadequacy and anxiety                    
              surrounding math, computers, and quantitative reasoning.
