Abstract    :
              Engineering students at the University of Michigan - Dearborn                  
              are using new Computer Integrated Manufacturing facilities that                
              enhance the existing Manufacturing Systems Laboratory.                         
              Computer Integrated Manufacturing (CIM) is a challenging                       
              multidisciplinary concept requiring advanced computer                          
              technology, software engineering skills, and computer                          
              networking.  This project involves the integration of                          
              manufacturing cells with existing CAD/CAM and simulation                       
              laboratories.  To complete the CIM environment experience, use                 
              of CAD/CAM simulation software is also part of the laboratory                  
              experiments.  The additions make possible two new courses on                   
              Computer Aided Engineering and Systems Integration, and enhance                
              the laboratory teaching of more than ten other engineering                     
              courses.
