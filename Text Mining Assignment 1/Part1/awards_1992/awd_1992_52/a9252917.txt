Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This three-year project will create six hour-long, interactive                 
              broadcasts for junior high school students which are focused on the            
              contributions of females in the development and advancement of                 
              mathematics and science.  Students will see male and female role               
              models in their work place, learn about contemporary careers and               
              historical contributions, and participate in related mathematics               
              activities before and after the broadcast.  Following the                      
              broadcasts, the video materials will be professionally edited and              
              widely distributed for further use in schools.  Dissemination

              Accompanying print materials will be developed for teacher and                 
              student use.  The materials will represent significant topics that             
              have extended use in the classroom.  Teachers will receive greater             
              background information on the role models and additional teaching              
              ideas.                                                                         
                                                                                             
              The formative evaluation will monitor the development and quality              
              of the broadcasts/videotapes and their effectiveness with students.            
                                                                                             
              The summative evaluation will evaluate data on course selection,               
              career plans, and recall of information about female role models.
