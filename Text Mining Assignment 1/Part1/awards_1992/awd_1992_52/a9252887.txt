Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              About 1.5 million students take an earth-science course each                   
              year.  All global environmental issues can be linked to an                     
              earth-science topic.  Existing earth-science course                            
              therefore provide an efficient route for reaching a                            
              significant number of the nation's students.  A survey of                      
              1000 members of the National Earth Science Teachers                            
              Association yielded a 49% response, with 97% of the                            
              respondents favoring the use of imagery-based activities in                    
              their courses.  Based on these and other data, it is likely                    
              that these materials will reach 750,000 students per year,                     
              greatly increasing the awareness of the nation's next adult                    
              generation to the environmental issues that they will face.                    
                                                                                             
              Fifteen hands-on modules using satellite and high altitude                     
              imagery that will confront students with the problems and                      
              challenges of our global environment, will be developed.                       
              Twenty master earth-science teachers will work with the                        
              staff on the development of the activities during each of                      
              three summer institutes.  The materials will be field tested                   
              by these teachers during two academic years for commercial                     
              publication.  A series of implementation workshops in                          
              cooperation with the commercial publisher to disseminate                       
              these materials will be held.
