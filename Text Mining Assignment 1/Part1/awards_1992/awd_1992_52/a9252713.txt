Abstract    :
              A symposium will be held a New York University on February 28,                 
              1992 involving 60 participants that represent the                              
              university/college and pre-college sectors, the private sector                 
              and private foundations.  The symposium will highlight the                     
              efforts of the National Science Foundation to strengthen pre-                  
              college and undergraduate education.  The symposium will also                  
              serve to encourage participants to become more actively                        
              involved in the design and development of new teacher                          
              preparation programs. The invited plenary speakers will address                
              issues related to preparation of mathematics and science                       
              teachers, recruitment and retention of women and minorities and                
              promotion of technical literacy.
