Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              MESA's Success Through Collaboration program expands to                        
              offer a science and mathematics summer camp for 40 American                    
              Indian middle school students from throughout California per                   
              year.  Held on the California Polytechnic University campus                    
              in San Luis Obispo and centering on an environmental theme,                    
              the camp is designed to:  develop a community of                               
              academically oriented rural and urban Indian students;                         
              excite students about science, mathematics and engineering                     
              and the career possibilities in those fields; bolster self-                    
              esteem; demonstrate the leadership training; increase                          
              critical thinking and communications skills; and deepen                        
              students' commitment to remain in school and obtain a                          
              college degree in science, mathematics or engineering.  The                    
              instructional approach includes cultural activities imbedded                   
              in an interdisciplinary environmental curriculum of hands-on                   
              mathematics and science and is facilitated by undergraduate                    
              role models and small group cooperative learning.  Students                    
              will complete environmental projects and present them                          
              through a conference-like forum to parents and peers.                          
              Professors and practicing engineers and scientists provide                     
              career counseling.  Academic year follow-up includes                           
              activities in MESA Academies, field trips, and guest                           
              speakers and MESA Clubs.  Camp graduates subsequently become                   
              members AISES and interact with AISES university student                       
              mentors.
