Abstract    :
              This project will provide equipment to develop an application-                 
              oriented introductory level lecture/laboratory course on                       
              automatic control. The course will emphasize the detailed                      
              modeling of real systems, basic controller design techniques,                  
              practical considerations, and the actual circuit implementation                
              of controllers. The aim of this course is to give the students                 
              a comprehensive view of control theory and to give them the                    
              opportunity of experiencing design and implementation practice                 
              that is closer to real-world engineering. Lecture material will                
              be developed for providing theoretical background and analysis                 
              techniques needed for carrying out the experiments and design                  
              exercises.  The major instruments being acquired include:                      
              digital storage oscilloscopes, printers, function generators,                  
              data acquisition cards, and personal computers.  Digital                       
              storage oscilloscopes will enable the students to record slowly                
              varying signals which are often encountered when analyzing                     
              mechanical systems. Software packages running on the PCs will                  
              be used for analysis, controller development, and simulations.
