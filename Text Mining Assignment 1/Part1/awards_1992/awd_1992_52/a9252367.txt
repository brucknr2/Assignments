Abstract    :
              An automated guided vehicle system (AGVS) is being installed in                
              the automated manufacturing laboratory.  The AGVS is an                        
              advanced materials handling system that can transport                          
              materials, parts or products, via a defined pathway,                           
              automatically in response to programmed commands.  It is being                 
              integrated into course demonstrations, student projects and                    
              laboratory exercises to give students hands-on experience in                   
              programming and setting up state-of-the-art automated equipment                
              of the type used in industry.
