Abstract    :
              The University of Michigan plans to completely revise its first                
              year calculus program over a three year period, adopting the                   
              materials developed in the Harvard consortium project.  The                    
              main features of the new program are:  (1) An intensive and                    
              ongoing instructor training program for all faculty and                        
              teaching assistants.  (2) A classroom environment that                         
              incorporates cooperative learning and experimentation by                       
              students.  (3) Major syllabus revision which emphasizes problem                
              solving, geometric visualization, and quantitative reasoning.                  
              (4) Integration of the graphing calculator into the curriculum.                
              The principal goals are:  (1) A concept driven course.  (2)                    
              Students are better prepared for, and more likely to take,                     
              further mathematics and science courses.  (3) A more enjoyable                 
              experience for students.
