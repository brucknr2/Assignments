Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The Rochester Institute of Technology (RIT) Summer Science Camp                
              offers a five-week summer program at the RIT campus and subsequent             
              Saturday seminars to extend, enrich and infuse the summer program's            
              concepts to 50 minority 6th, 7th, and 8th graders with demonstrated            
              aptitudes for mathematics and science.  Fifty mentors, volunteers from         
              Eastman Kodak Company, join parents for a parenting skills/career              
              counseling seminar.  Students, parents, and mentors come together              
              to assist program staff in attaining the primary goal of guiding               
              students toward high technology careers.  The SSC campus                       
              experience provides core discipline courses in mathematics, the                
              sciences, engineering, technology and communications.  Through a               
              multidisciplinary approach with risk-taking, creative thinking, problem        
              solving, decision making and goal setting, the program builds student          
              self-confidence, self-esteem, and motivation for academic excellence.          
              A major research project is required.  Unique features of the SSC's            
              integrated curriculum include teaching concepts on a need-to-know              
              basis, which tailors the mathematics content to meet the needs of the          
              sciences, and in turn, supports the engineering courses.  Concept              
              reinforcement occurs through field trips and student-mentor                    
              interaction.
