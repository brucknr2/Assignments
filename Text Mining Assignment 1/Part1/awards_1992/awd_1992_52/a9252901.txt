Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The North Carolina School for Science and Mathematics                          
              purposes a three year project directed at developing                           
              materials for an applications-oriented calculus course                         
              designed particularly for the high school classroom.                           
              Differences in teaching format, abilty and motivation of                       
              students, and instructor background between high school                        
              classroom.                                                                     
                                                                                             
              Comtemporary Calculus for the High School Classroom will                       
              develop  (1) a complete text for a two-semester, single                        
              variable calculus course, (2) a laboratory manual for full                     
              component of computer laboratory experiments,  and (3) an                      
              alternative complement of laboratory experiments for                           
              graphing calculators.
