Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The "Hands-on Universe" project creates eight supplemental                     
              investigations in which students analyze astronomical images                   
              taken by remote telescopes using charge coupled device                         
              detectors.  Current and past images will become available                      
              from the Automated Supernova Search, which takes 500 images                    
              per clear night.  The analysis is done in the classroom                        
              using IBM-compatible image processing software developed at                    
              the University of California/Berkeley for research work.                       
              The activities, intended for high school astronomy, physics                    
              or physical science courses, provide hands-on investigations                   
              coupled with an in-depth experience of engaging in science                     
              research using powerful technological tools.                                   
              Telecommunications links students, teachers and                                
              professionals in a genuine collaborative and apprenticeship                    
              style interaction which can lead to original research.  The                    
              activities, generated by professional astronomers and                          
              teachers, include investigations of the mass of Jupiter by                     
              measuring the motion of one of its moons, spatial dimensions                   
              of the solar system, collaborative searches for varying                        
              sources, plotting light curves, and distance to distant                        
              objects.  Materials will include an introductory video,                        
              student materials, and software for students to conduct                        
              their own image processing activities.
