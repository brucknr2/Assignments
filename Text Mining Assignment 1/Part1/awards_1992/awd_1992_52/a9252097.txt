Abstract    :
              The Center serves a variety of lower division biology classes,                 
              with a current focus on the non-science major including                        
              elementary education majors.  A key objective of the Center is                 
              to create a positive and literate approach to science among                    
              these students.  Studies of molecular biology are used as the                  
              basis of advancing understanding of biological principles.                     
              Equipment includes computers for data analysis and                             
              electrophoresis systems for data generation.
