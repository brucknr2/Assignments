Abstract    :
              The Department of Chemistry is acquiring apparatus for thermal                 
              analysis.  Experiments focusing on thermal techniques for                      
              characterizing chemical systems are being adapted from the                     
              current chemical literature for use in the advanced                            
              undergraduate curriculum.  The ability to rapidly obtain                       
              experimental information from differential calorimetry (DSC)                   
              and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) is substantially                          
              increasing the number of students who experience hands-on                      
              laboratory applications of thermodynamics to molecular systems                 
              and polymeric materials, thereby strengthening student research                
              in chemistry, biochemistry, and inorganic/materials science.                   
              Differential thermal methods are useful for determining                        
              composition and identification, for providing thermal                          
              information on fusion, desolvation, dehydration, oxidation,                    
              reduction, adsorption, degradation, and solid-state reactions.                 
              From these thermodynamic values, entropy changes and the rates                 
              of reactions and transitions are being determined.
