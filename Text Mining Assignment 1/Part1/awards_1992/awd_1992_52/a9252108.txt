Abstract    :
              This project will provide equipment to establish a distributed                 
              computer system laboratory using several workstations in a                     
              local area network.  This laboratory will be used to teach                     
              network communications and distributed control concepts.  In                   
              the computer networks course the students will design and                      
              implement interprocess communications between peer processes on                
              different nodes, interface between adjacent layers of                          
              communication systems, interface between the kernel and the                    
              communication system and network performance analysis.  In the                 
              distributed computer systems course, they will implement file                  
              servers and compute servers (processor pool) using the client-                 
              server model of computing.
