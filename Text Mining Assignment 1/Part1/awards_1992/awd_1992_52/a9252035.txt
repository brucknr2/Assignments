Abstract    :
              We are to developing a number of new experiments for the                       
              senior-year undergraduate Solid State Physics Laboratory course                
              with the transmission electron microscope (TEM) they have                      
              acquired with ILI grant funds.  Such an instrument did not                     
              previously exist in the Physics Department and this did not                    
              permit the inclusion of microstructural studies in the teaching                
              laboratory curriculum.  The provision of the TEM allows                        
              laboratory instructors to emphasize the importance of the                      
              relationship between lattice structure and electronic                          
              properties in the solid state of matter.  The experiments                      
              demonstrate a number of important phenomena in modern solid                    
              state physics including atomic lattice imaging, quantum                        
              interference of electrons, charge density waves, and quasi-                    
              crystal diffraction. The instrument is being used in both                      
              imaging and reciprocal space modes and is available also for                   
              Modern Physics course demonstrations of the wave nature of                     
              electrons and atomic structure.  The equipment, in addition, is                
              available for undergraduate research projects in solid state                   
              physics.  A laboratory manual and resource book is being                       
              written to make the new experiments accessible to other                        
              undergraduate programs.
