Abstract    :
              A consortium of two year colleges, four year colleges, and high                
              schools in New Jersey and Pennsylvania are implementing a                      
              Calculator Enhanced Instruction Project.  This project                         
              continues activities initiated with a previous NSF award.                      
              Through consortium workshops, faculty will plan teaching                       
              strategies involving calculators, following approaches                         
              developed at Clemson University.  These approaches will be used                
              throughout the calculus sequence, including linear algebra.
