Abstract    :
                    Data sets--one primarily on women in a study of publicly                 
              funded housing, and a second on the "hidden homeless," who are                 
              primarily men, will be provided by the host institution, and will be           
              used to examine:  1) how men's and women's responses to                        
              destitution vary; and 2) the range of strategies women and men                 
              use to survive destitution, the relationship among those strategies,           
              changes over time in their use, and their consequences for various             
              aspects of well-being.  Appropriate data analytic techniques--both             
              qualitative and quantitative--will be used to compare women and                
              men as well as to make comparisons among different groups of                   
              women.                                                                         
                    The proposed research will examine survival strategies in                
              the face of destitution, especially as they are shaped by gender.              
                    This project furthers VPW program objectives to provide                  
              opportunities for women to advance their careers in science or                 
              engineering through research, and to encourage other women to                  
              pursue careers in these areas through the investigator's enhanced              
              visibility as a role model on the host campus.  The proposed                   
              activities which contribute to the second objective include:                   
              collaboration with an ongoing project at the Institute, a seminar for          
              graduate students, mentoring individual graduate research                      
              assistants, consulting with undergraduates in the Honors College,              
              as well as presenting talks to both the Department of Sociology                
              and other units on campus.
