Abstract    :
              The conference/workshop PREPARING FOR A NEW CALCULUS is                        
              bringing together eighty leaders in mathematics curriculum                     
              reform, including calculus reform, school mathematics reform in                
              light of the NCTM Curriculum Standards, and educational                        
              technology initiatives.  The deliberations of this conference                  
              will focus on the implications of the emerging calculus courses                
              on school mathematics training, and on how recent developments                 
              in content and methods in high school mathematics will impact                  
              the calculus courses.  The primary product of this conference                  
              will be a set of action oriented recommendations addressing                    
              these issues and strengthening the ties between these reform                   
              movements.  A proceedings document will be distributed                         
              nationally to disseminate these recommendations.
