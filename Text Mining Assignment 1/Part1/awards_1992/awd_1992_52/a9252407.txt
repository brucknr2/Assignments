Abstract    :
              An upper-division laboratory course is being established for                   
              undergraduate students at the senior level who are pursuing                    
              physics and related disciplines.  Within this laboratory                       
              course, there are 13 experiments.  These are as follows:  1) x-                
              ray analysis; 2) electrical resistivity vs. temperature; 3)                    
              Hall Effect vs. temperature, drift velocity; 4) thermal                        
              conductivity vs. temperature; 5) thermoelectric power vs.                      
              temperature; 6) magnetic susceptibility vs. temperature; 7)                    
              magnetization vs. temperature; 8) superconductivity - metallic                 
              and oxide; 9) infrared absorption; 10) internal photoemission;                 
              11) minority carrier lifetime; 12) Mossbauer spectroscopy; and                 
              13) electron tunneling.Most of the equipment items are being                   
              purchased, but they are making for themselves such items as                    
              low-temperature dewar stations with associated cryogenic probes                
              and vacuum plumbing.A one-semester introductory lecture course                 
              in solid state physics is also being developed the at same                     
              time.  The lecture and laboratory courses are being offered                    
              together.
