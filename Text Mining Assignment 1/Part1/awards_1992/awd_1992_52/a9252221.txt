Abstract    :
              The Department of Geography is purchasing satellite receiving                  
              and data display equipment to incorporate real-time weather                    
              maps into the meteorology courses for both science and non-                    
              science majors.  Students are making use of weather maps as                    
              part of their laboratory experiences as well as in observing                   
              the daily weather variations that occur.  The significance of                  
              this project is that it:  1) incorporates current atmospheric                  
              conditions into the learning experience for the students,                      
              thereby allowing the students to become directly involved with                 
              the subject matter of the course, 2) documents the relevance of                
              the science to the non-science student, 3) stimulates the                      
              curiosity of the students surrounding atmospheric behavior, and                
              4) provides non-science students with the opportunity to                       
              collect and analyze data in an introductory meteorology course.
