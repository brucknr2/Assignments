Abstract    :
              The University of Michigan College of Engineering is collaborating with        
              the University's Center for the Education of Women in designing and            
              conducting this model project to address the problem of "the higher the        
              fewer."  Efforts are being made to increase the participation of women         
              in engineering careers through testing, evaluation and dissemination           
              of a program for undergraduate women designed to encourage their entry         
              into and completion of graduate study.  Involved is a comprehensive set        
              of activities, starting in the junior year and continuing through the          
              senior year.  The activities include seminars focusing on graduate             
              school and career issues in engineering; research internships; support         
              and discussion groups designed to address work and family concerns and         
              related personal issues; and the preparation of symposia, funding              
              applications and research prospectuses.
