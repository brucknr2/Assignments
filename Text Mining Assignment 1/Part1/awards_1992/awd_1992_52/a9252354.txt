Abstract    :
              The aim of this project is to improve science education in the                 
              disciplines of psychology, sociology, and geography through the                
              creation of a dedicated computer laboratory to be shared by the                
              three disciplines.  This laboratory will enhance the ability of                
              students in each discipline to conduct supervised and/or                       
              original research and will facilitate instruction in the use of                
              computers and computer methods as research instruments.This                    
              project will also involve students and faculty in analysis of                  
              data from projects conducted within the community.  Results                    
              from these studies would be provided pro bono to community                     
              agencies and local government entities.
