Abstract    :
              A three dimensional computer-graphics based projector and host-                
              computer are being installed in the campus planetarium.   The                  
              Digistar System utilizes computer-generated graphics to allow                  
              students a three dimensional view of the universe from any                     
              vantage point.  In addition to enhancements in astronomy                       
              classes, other applications are being developed which include                  
              three dimensional simulation of static and dynamic features                    
              such as molecular structure, planetary tectonics, storm                        
              formations and ocean currents for use in chemistry, geology,                   
              meteorology, oceanography and physics.  Drafting students using                
              AutoCAD software on desktop computers are involved in the                      
              development of these extended applications.
