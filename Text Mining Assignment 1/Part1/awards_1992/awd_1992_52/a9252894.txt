Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              A series of design challenges will be developed to motivate                    
              high school students of all abilities to study science in                      
              the context of practical problem-solving.  Students will                       
              research, design, construct and evaluate to practical                          
              problems that intrigue them.  The challenges will draw on                      
              information from across the range of traditional science                       
              topics.  Solutions will arise from group discussion and                        
              information analysis.  These materials are to augment and                      
              consolidate science learning and, mode importantly, generate                   
              process and practical skills, transferable to other                            
              circumstances, in team work, information gathering and                         
              processing, evaluation, and application of knowledge to                        
              practical situations.  Sample assessment strategies for                        
              working with groups of students of diverse abilities will be                   
              developed.  To help teachers and students obtain manageable                    
              ideas, a "Source Book" will be produced.  In addition, a                       
              teacher Resource Guide, suggesting sources of materials,                       
              giving technical advice and linking the challenges to                          
              science topics, will be provided.
