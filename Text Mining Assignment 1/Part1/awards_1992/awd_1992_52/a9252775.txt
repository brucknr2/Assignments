Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Eugenio Maria de Hostos Community College and Cornell University               
              Cooperative Extension collaboratively designed this environmental              
              summer science camp in which fifty African-American and Hispanic               
              ninth grade students per year will participate in innovative,                  
              inquiry-based scientific projects and learn about careers in science,          
              engineering, and mathematics.  Through hands-on laboratory                     
              activities, participants will learn about the deterioration of the             
              environment as it affects land, air, and water resources, and the role         
              of scientist and engineers in protecting and reversing this                    
              environmental damage.  Utilizing New York City's natural resources as          
              well as its professional scientists, engineers, and mathematicians,            
              students will also learn about science from a socially responsible and         
              ethical perspective.  TERRA  brings together practicing scientists,            
              college faculty, and high school teachers to challenge and motivate            
              minority ninth graders to stay in school, take additional courses in           
              high school, and learn about career opportunities in these fields.
