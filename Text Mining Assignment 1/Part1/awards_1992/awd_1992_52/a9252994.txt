Abstract    :
                    This research is relative to a compartmental model of the                
              cell growth cycle to better understand the triggering mechanism                
              for the initiation of DNA synthesis and mitosis.  The model was                
              first proposed and analyzed by Busenberg and Mahffy who                        
              showed that the increase in cell size can trigger biochemical                  
              oscillations leading to DNA synthesis.  The relation between                   
              nutrient supply and increase in cell size is, however, now well                
              understood.  In addition, the geometrical shape of the cell is an              
              important factor in the triggering mechanism and so far only the               
              case of a spherical cell has been treated.                                     
                    The research will investigate the effect of nutrient supply              
              and the shape of the cell on the initiation of DNA synthesis.                  
                    The project furthers VPW program objectives to provide                   
              opportunities for women to advance their careers in science or                 
              engineering through research, and to encourage other women to                  
              pursue careers in these areas through the investigator's enhanced              
              visibility as a role model on the host campus.  The proposed                   
              activities which contribute to the second objective include:                   
              teaching two sections of an elementary differential equations                  
              course, which will enable the P.I. to interact with many students in           
              their freshman or sophomore years; organizing, jointly with                    
              Busenberg, a weekly Mathematical Biology Seminar; giving a                     
              series of lectures on her own research; and inviting applied                   
              mathematicians from other universities as guest speakers, six of               
              whom would be women; providing guidance and counseling,                        
              especially to women students.
