Abstract    :
              This proposal outlined a program to use the sol-gel and polymer                
              pyrolysis processes to produce oxides (mullite and stabilized                  
              zirconia) and non-oxides (SiC and Si3N4) fibers.  The emphasis will            
              be on developing a fundamental understanding the processes.                    
              %%%%                                                                           
              This proposed program aims in developing a fundamental                         
              understanding the processes used to produce oxides and non-oxides              
              via the sol-gel route.  Mullite and stabilized zirconia are the                
              oxides planned for study, SiC and Si3N4 are non-oxides planned.                
              The study will make significant contributions to a very useful and             
              important field of reserach
