Abstract    :
              The project aim is to extend and refine an innovative and                      
              promising application of intelligent tutoring systems developed                
              collaboratively by the University of Pittsburgh's Economics                    
              Department and Learning Research and Development Center.  The                  
              methodology is a pioneering attempt at teaching major portions                 
              of the introductory microeconomics syllabus as a laboratory                    
              science.  The direction taken is likely to serve as a model for                
              economics departments at other schools, given the way it                       
              addresses a pervasive dissatisfaction with the current methods                 
              of teaching beginning economics courses.  An important feature                 
              of the project is the vast amount of data which it will gather                 
              on student learning difficulties at the University of                          
              Pittsburgh and other college and universities.  Results derived                
              from this project should reinvigorate what has been a declining                
              interest over the past several years in instructional research                 
              on the post-secondary teaching of economics.
