Abstract    :
              Diagnostic techniques based on video analysis and digital image                
              processing are implemented using inexpensive educational                       
              computers and home-video systems.  Coupled with laser-based                    
              imaging systems, these techniques enable a quantitative                        
              understanding of the details of unsteady, multidimensional                     
              flows.  This permits us to address a major need in                             
              undergraduate fluid dynamics education: we can teach about                     
              unsteady flows, and equip the engineering graduate with the                    
              understanding and skills needed to make flow control                           
              innovations in a variety of applications.  A laboratory is                     
              proposed, to be organized around the existing strengths of a                   
              modern aerospace fluid dynamics curriculum, to test this                       
              concept for a year.  Success will lead to  a new way of                        
              teaching fluid dynamics, where students will work hands-on with                
              actual , dynamic flow images as part of their courses.  The                    
              project consists of designing and implementing an experimental                 
              image database, using it in course assignments, developing and                 
              teaching a new course on advanced flow diagnostics, and                        
              developing course material for a new Flow Control course.  The                 
              results will be disseminated by means of image data discs,                     
              manuals and a Conference paper.
