Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The every day Mathematis:  4-6 Project is to create a                          
              complete mathematics curriculum for grades 4, 5, and 6.  It                    
              assumes that entering fourth graders have had a rich and                       
              varied mathematical experiene in grades K-3.  The materials                    
              build on the Everyday Mathematics K-3 curriculum. The                          
              Everyday Mathematics Curriculum emphasizes explorations of                     
              data and mathematical modeling in common life situations and                   
              in the natural and social sciences, arts and language.                         
              Mathematics' structures and algorithmic procedures are                         
              attended to as important issues in effective mathematical                      
              modeling.  Pedagogic approaches emphasize small group and                      
              partner cooperative work.
