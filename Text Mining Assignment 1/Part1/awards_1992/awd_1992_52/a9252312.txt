Abstract    :
              The proposal requests equipment to modernize undergraduate                     
              training in pharmacology by introducing the techniques of                      
              molecular biology and immunology into both an undergraduate                    
              majors course in experimental pharmacology and an undergraduate                
              independent research course.  Three faculty members will                       
              collaborate to accomplish this goal.  One is expert in                         
              molecular biology techniques; another is expert in                             
              immunological methods and quantitative imaging techniques; the                 
              third member contributes a classical pharmacology perspective                  
              and, as Director of Undergraduate Studies, is skilled at                       
              incorporating research developments into the undergraduate                     
              teaching program.  The department is currently equipped with a                 
              DNA sequencer, an oligonucleotide synthesizer, a fluorescence                  
              imaging system, and a blot analyzer.  The additional equipment                 
              requested will be coupled with the existing sophisticated                      
              instrumentation in order to revitalize the two courses.
