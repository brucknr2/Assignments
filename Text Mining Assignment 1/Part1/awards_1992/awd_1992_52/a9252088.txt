Abstract    :
              The proposal seeks funding to add computers and videodisc                      
              technology to the laboratory component of the non-technical                    
              majors' (mostly business and education majors) introductory                    
              biology course at the University of Wisconsin-Whitewater.  The                 
              new laboratory syllabus is structured around three major                       
              biological themes, Genetics, Evolution, and Ecology.  Students                 
              will work in groups in the laboratory.  Each lab period                        
              incorporates computer work, videodisc review, and hands-on wet-                
              lab activities.  Emphasis on human aspects of biology,                         
              integration of items from the daily headlines, and use of                      
              everyday items (e.g., foods) in hands-on laboratory work will                  
              bring the relevance of biology home to the target audience.
