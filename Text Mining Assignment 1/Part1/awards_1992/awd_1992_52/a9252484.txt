Abstract    :
              Calculus and Mathematica is a laboratory course in calculus based              
              on electronic interactive notebooks written within the                         
              Mathematica system.  In two years the teaching of Calculus and                 
              Mathematica has spread to more than twenty colleges and six                    
              high schools.  The proposed work is continuing this project by                 
              extending the development, dissemination, and evaluation of the                
              existing Calculus & Mathematica project.  Development includes                 
              a thorough revision of materials for Calculus I, Calculus II,                  
              and Calculus III, together with a pilot development of a                       
              Differential Equations course.  Dissemination includes                         
              implementation in a network of rural high schools.
