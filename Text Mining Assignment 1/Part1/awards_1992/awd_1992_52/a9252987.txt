Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Playtime Is Science:  A National Model for Parent                              
              Involvement In Early Science Education is an innovative                        
              parent/child science activity program.  The overall goal of                    
              the model is to enlarge the potential pool of students who                     
              are competent in science and technology to include more                        
              girls, children of color, with disabilities, and children                      
              from low-income families.  By engaging parents in                              
              partnership with schools and community organizations,                          
              Playtime Is Science will increase the science literacy of                      
              young children (ages 4-7) as well as that of their parents                     
              and other adults in their lives.                                               
                                                                                             
              This three-year project, built on a successful local model                     
              developed in New York City public schools, will include the                    
              following activities:  training and networking for site                        
              liaisons; pilot testing and evaluation at three sites chosen                   
              for geographic, racial, ethnic, language, and socioeconomic                    
              diversity; materials development and production; a formal                      
              research study; and intensive national dissemination of                        
              Playtime Is Science materials package.  Materials to be                        
              developed include 1)  four videotapes to provide a visual                      
              rendering of the program for parents, teachers, and                            
              administrators; 2)  a how-to manual providing easy-to-follow                   
              instructions for implementing the program; 3)  and a home                      
              activity booklet for parents illustrating science activities                   
              which utilize inexpensive, readily-available materials found                   
              in every home.
