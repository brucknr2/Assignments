Abstract    :
              The Foundation for Glacier and Environmental Research is                       
              acquiring state-of-the art seismic and ice radar equipment with                
              integrated portable computers for undergraduates to coduct                     
              research work will be conducted on the Juneau Icefield, Alaska.                
              Undergraduates are determining sidewall effects of ice radar                   
              and gathering more accurate ice depth data.  Eighteen cross                    
              glacier profiles are being analyzed for ice volume                             
              interpretations.  These and allied student projects are                        
              uncovering trends in meteorological and mass balance changes,                  
              and obtaining measurements of radiation energy controlling                     
              glacier ablation and affecting the runoff of supraglacial                      
              streams.
