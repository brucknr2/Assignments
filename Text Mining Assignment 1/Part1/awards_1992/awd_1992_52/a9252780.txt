Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The Y.E.S. Summer Science Camp is a six week commuter                          
              mathematics and science program along with a follow-up academic                
              year program.  The program serves two hundred and twenty-five                  
              seventh through ninth grade African-American, Hispanic                         
              and Native-American students over a three year period.  The objectives         
              of the program are to:  1) introduce students to science, engineering          
              and mathematics concepts in a culturally relevant manner; 2) teach             
              students how academic coursework relates to their futures; 3) show             
              students how science, engineering and math relates to the world                
              around them; and 4) help parents become better informed and actively           
              involved in the education of their children.  The program involves             
              volunteer scientists and engineers from local industry and San                 
              Francisco State University.  Program activities include: science,              
              computer science, mathematics and communications courses, guests               
              speakers, laboratory demonstrations/experiments, field trips and group         
              research projects.  During the academic year students participate in           
              the existing MESA Program at their school site.
