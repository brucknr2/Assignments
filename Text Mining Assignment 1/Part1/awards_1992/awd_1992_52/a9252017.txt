Abstract    :
              Wabash Valley College is developing an interactive multimedia                  
              laboratory to improve industrial training in two-year Applied                  
              Sciences programs.  Faculty from the College's Electronics and                 
              Diesel Hydraulics programs are developing a new inter-                         
              departmental course that focuses on a team approach to problem                 
              solving, using the multimedia laboratory to simulate the                       
              principles and functions of robotics, hydraulics, and                          
              programmable controllers in today's workplace.  Computerized                   
              interactive video tapes are being developed to supplement the                  
              instruction.  Interactive media allows the student to see and                  
              manipulate key equipment and the processes used in a                           
              manufacturing environment.  The multimedia laboratory is to be                 
              shared with other departments in the Applied Sciences field and                
              with area high schools.
