Abstract    :
              Undergraduate students in the Department of Civil Engineering                  
              at the University of Florida are using  instrumentation and                    
              measurement equipment as part of a new course on laboratory and                
              field testing.  The laboratory course involves electrical                      
              measurements, data acquisition, strain gage applications,                      
              pressure transducers, linear variable differential transformers                
              for measurement of displacement, anemometer and temperature                    
              measurements, and moisture and pH measurements, all of which                   
              are an important part of civil engineering practice.  In this                  
              laboratory the students increase their appreciation of the                     
              errors involved in the measurements and learn the effective                    
              utilization of test data.
