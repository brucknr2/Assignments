Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The three year New Jersey Institute of Technology Summer Science               
              Camp serves seventy-eight seventh grade, low income, educationally             
              disadvantaged African-American and Hispanic students from Newark               
              public schools.  The non-residential program is comprised of a                 
              four-week summer component with eight follow-up sessions.                      
              Instruction is provided in science and math, based on the theme of             
              Marine Science, oral and written communication skills, as well as four         
              field trips to various marine science locations in New Jersey.  In             
              addition, students receive academic, financial and career counseling           
              and are exposed to formal and informal interaction with minority and           
              women professors and students already engaged in science based                 
              careers.  Parents/guardians are involved throughout the program.               
              Project partners include:  the Newark Board of Education, the New              
              Jersey Marine Science Consortium and the Protestant Community                  
              Center, Inc, a community based parent organization.  Follow-up                 
              activities will be carried out during each academic year which provide         
              additional math/science opportunities, academic and career                     
              counseling, and monitoring of student progress.
