Abstract    :
              A consortium is being organized consisting of institutions in                  
              the Charlotte metropolitan area that are interested in calculus                
              reform.  The Metrolina Calculus Consortium will include local                  
              universities and colleges, community colleges, and secondary                   
              schools.  The project will provide support and resources for                   
              faculty to adapt and implement a technology-based calculus                     
              curriculum.  A summer workshop will be conducted for faculty of                
              these institutions, who will then teach a technology based                     
              calculus course at their institutions during the following                     
              year.  Monthly sessions will be held to discuss problems, as                   
              well as having more in depth two day meetings at the end of                    
              each semester.  The workshop will be repeated the following                    
              year for new participants.  Support materials will be developed                
              to help high school teachers, community college faculty, and                   
              graduate students in implementing a technology based calculus                  
              course.  The materials will be individualized for the                          
              particular audience.  Long term research will be conducted to                  
              find the effectiveness of technology based calculus on                         
              students.  In particular, there will be assessment of high                     
              school students who are taking a technology based calculus                     
              course and their success in college calculus will be monitored.
