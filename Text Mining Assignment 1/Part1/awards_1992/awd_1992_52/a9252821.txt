Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This is a proposal to investigate how female and minority college              
              students have come to know mathematics.  Students will participate             
              in a series of interviews that will focus on attitudes and beliefs             
              about mathematics, previous mathematical experiences, how students             
              deal with difficulities and problems in the learning of                        
              mathematics, how students relate mathematics to the real world, and            
              how students communicate about mathematics.  Results of these                  
              interviews will be used to understand patterns of student learning             
              and how these patterns can be applied to instructional processes.
