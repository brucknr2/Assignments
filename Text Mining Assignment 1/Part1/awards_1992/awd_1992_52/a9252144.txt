Abstract    :
              GC/MS instrumentation will augment several courses beginning                   
              with General Chemistry and progressing through the curriculum                  
              to Instrumental Analysis and student research.  Isotope                        
              analysis and air sampling studies will be introduced in General                
              Chemistry. Organic Chemistry will use GC/MS for structure                      
              determination and reaction product and mechanisms studies.                     
              Further experiments on kinetics and thermodynamics in Physical                 
              Chemistry and careful analytical work in Instrumental Analysis                 
              will be employed.  Laboratory instruction will be supplemented                 
              by the use of computers and programs already available in mass                 
              spectra interpretation.  Further, a video based on our acquired                
              instrumentation will be prepared to introduce the GC/MS                        
              technique prior to student contact with the equipment.
