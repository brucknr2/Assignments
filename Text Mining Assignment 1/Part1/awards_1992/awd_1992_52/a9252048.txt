Abstract    :
              The Department of Environmental Studies is acquiring an                        
              inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometer for use                
              in the analysis of environmentally important materials by                      
              students in both lower and upper division courses. The                         
              instrument is being used by undergraduates to analyze: magazine                
              inks for toxic metals such as cadmium; both essential and non-                 
              essential metals in shellfish and other aquatic organisms; and,                
              the content of various metals in soils, fuels, and landfill                    
              leachates.  The instrument is being used extensively in                        
              undergraduate research projects.
