Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The Science Education for Public Understanding Program                         
              (SEPUP) will develop, field test nationally and publish two                    
              one-year courses:  a more concrete course for middle school                    
              and a course emphasizing global issues for high school.  The                   
              courses will stress issues-oriented science and the use of                     
              scientific evidence and risk-benefit analysis in making                        
              decisions.  These courses will continue the emphasis of the                    
              Chemical Education for Public Understanding Program (CEPUP)                    
              on societal issues involving the use of chemicals and expand                   
              the scope of the program by dealing with other issues in                       
              life, earth and physical sciences and in technology.  Eight                    
              new modules will cover many of the large themes of science                     
              proposed in Project 2061 along with issue-oriented themes                      
              such as evidence-based decision-making, uncertainty and                        
              controversy, science and social systems.  Course materials                     
              will stress students as active participants in doing science                   
              with the goal of developing independent thinkers able to                       
              make evidence-based decisions about issues in science and                      
              technology.  Materials will include a teacher's resource                       
              book, a student text, projects and extension activities,                       
              kits videotapes and software.  Assessment of student                           
              learning is built into the materials.
