Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Clark Atlanta University is sponsoring a four-week Summer Science              
              Camp for forty seventh and eighth grade African-American students              
              each summer for the three year period, 1992-1994.  Program                     
              participants, selected from elementary and middle schools in                   
              Metropolitan Atlanta, enroll in an academic enrichment experience that         
              includes interdisciplinary science, computer applications,                     
              mathematics, and communication skills.  Instruction emphasizes                 
              problem solving and critical thinking while focusing on real life              
              situations.  In addition to classroom experiences, participants interact       
              with research scientists in their laboratories and in career awareness         
              seminars and discussion groups.  Weekly field trips round out the              
              academic experiences of the program.  Follow-up activities during the          
              academic year include workshops each semester for program                      
              participants and their parents, an awards program at the end of the            
              school year, and a mentoring program in which participants are                 
              matched  with undergraduate or graduate student science majors who             
              serve as their mentors.
