Abstract    :
              The goal of this project is to introduce students to recent                    
              progress in three subfields of modern optics: holography,                      
              optical phase conjugation, and the photorefractive effect.  A                  
              number of imaginative expreriments have been designed.  These                  
              experiences enhance their understandings of fundamental                        
              concepts in physical optics, and stimulate their interest in                   
              scientific research.
