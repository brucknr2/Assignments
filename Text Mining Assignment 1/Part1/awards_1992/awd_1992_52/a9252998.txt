Abstract    :
                    Employer's growing dependence on women and the                           
              changing demographics of the labor force have pushed gender                    
              issues to the forefront of workplace reforms.  This project asks               
              about the conditions that prompt some corporations to institute                
              policies and programs to help women meet their family obligations              
              and succeed at their jobs.  The research design includes a survey              
              of 1,000 major corporations regarding policies and programs for                
              women and an on-site case study of one corporation with a                      
              reputation for supporting women.  The survey of corporations                   
              asks about global predictors of responsiveness to women, and the               
              case study inquires about the dynamics of gender relations                     
              relative to corporate structures, culture, and practices.  Guided by           
              new structuralism/devaluation theory and theories of gender (that              
              focus on the institutional and processual aspects of gender), the              
              investigator asks:  (1) what kinds of corporations are helping                 
              women?  (2) what strategies are they using?  (3) how effective are             
              these strategies and for whom?                                                 
                    The identification of conditions and practices that help                 
              women meet their job and family obligations gives practical and                
              policy-relevant import to this research.                                       
                    The project furthers VPW program objectives to provide                   
              opportunities for women to advance their careers in science or                 
              engineering through research, and to encourage other women to                  
              pursue careers in these areas through the investigator's enhanced              
              visibility as a role model on the host campus.  The proposed                   
              activities which contribute to the second objective include:                   
              bringing women scientists to campus to discuss their research on               
              sex/gender and science, and on gender, work and family;                        
              teaching; mentoring, and counseling.
