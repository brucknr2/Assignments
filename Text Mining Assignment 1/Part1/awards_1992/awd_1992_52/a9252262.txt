Abstract    :
               A microcomputer mathematics laboratory is being established                   
              for use in courses for the first two years of college                          
              mathematics.  Students are working with computer investigations                
              of mathematics concepts in a laboratory situation.  These                      
              investigations include the construction of mathematical                        
              processes and objects on a computer, the use of symbolic                       
              manipulation, and the use of graphics to foster cognitive                      
              development of understandings of mathematical ideas and                        
              concepts.  In addition, an appropriate cooperative learning                    
              component for the laboratory and classroom settings is being                   
              developed. Research into how students learn mathematics, and                   
              into their attitudes about mathematics and the learning of                     
              mathematics is being conducted in this setting.  Investigations                
              are also being conducted into how the use of computer                          
              technology and an appropriate cooperative learning environment                 
              can enhance the learning of mathematics for a non-traditional                  
              population.
