Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This work aims at producing a series of case studies of the                    
              appropriation of advanced technology into the everyday classroom               
              practices of teachers.  We will follow a collection of teachers--              
              who range from technology-sophisticated and professionally                     
              innovative, to completely computer-naive -- as they learn about                
              and seek to incorporate a flexible, advanced technology, the                   
              Boxer system, into their day-to-day teaching.  The case studies                
              will be interpretive and synthetic, organized around themes that               
              emerge as important in the practice of these teachers and in the               
              processes of change.  Each study will involve a "stratified                    
              analysis" including:  teachers' values and learning goals, the                 
              repeatable patterns they use in classrooms (activity structures),              
              the skills both teachers and students need to reproduce such                   
              patterns, and the kind of learning that results.  The forms of                 
              these case studies will be:  (1) extended narrative analysis                   
              charting facilitory patterns and critical barriers; and (2)                    
              richly annotated video tapes of classroom practice.  We will                   
              incorporate student teachers as apprentice researches in studying              
              effective new forms of instruction based on the availability of                
              advanced technology.
