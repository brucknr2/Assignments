Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The Summer Science Camp Program is designed to rejuvenate the                  
              student interest in natural science and mathematics at an early age.           
              Annually, forty-eight seventh and eighth grade African-American                
              students are exposed to natural sciences, mathematics,                         
              communication skills and computer science in an intensive                      
              four-week residential summer session at Jackson State University               
              (JSU).  Activities include classroom instruction and laboratory                
              demonstrations/experiments and involve individual as well as group             
              interaction with communication skills (oral and written), applications         
              of mathematical concepts, and computer applications.  Upper level              
              science technology students serve as mentors for the participants and          
              continue this contact throughout the academic year as well as actively         
              assist the instructors.  In addition, speakers from local industry and         
              JSU serve as invited speakers; students take field trips to science            
              museums, planetariums and federal laboratories.  Students will                 
              participate in similar programs until grade twelve and will be tracked         
              throughout their academic career.
