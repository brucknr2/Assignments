Abstract    :
              This project aims to improve the quality of undergraduate                      
              instruction in physics through the incorporation of real-time                  
              Microcomputer-Based Laboratory (MBL) tools into calculus-based                 
              introductory physics courses and Physics Concepts I and II at                  
              Lakewood Community College.  The college has a significant                     
              population of women and minorities among its 3480 FTE (6180                    
              headcount), and the timing of this project coincides with                      
              statewide initiatives to recognize and increase the number of                  
              outstanding women and minorities in the sciences, both students                
              and faculty.  The department has experienced and committed                     
              faculty who are enthusiastic about incorporating Workshop                      
              Physics, Tools for Scientific Thinking and MBL at Lakewood as                  
              a model for replication in the Minnesota Community College                     
              system.  The instruments purchased, with software, equip ten                   
              lab stations.
