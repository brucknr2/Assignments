Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The New Mexico Comprehensive Regional Center for                               
              Minorities (NM-CRCM), is a statewide program for                               
              implementing a K-12 continum of enhanced science and                           
              math programs in the schools.  The NM-CRCM flagship                            
              programs, the Mathematics Engineering Science                                  
              Achievement (MESA) project, and the Community Academy                          
              for Science and Mathematics (CASM), are proven programs                        
              that directly address the NSF's CRCM goals and                                 
              objectives.  In addition, these programs include                               
              specific operational structures that maximize their                            
              potential to be sustained in the schools beyond NM-CRCM                        
              support.                                                                       
                                                                                             
              New Mexico has a number of other effective programs in                         
              science and math enhancement that direct collaborators                         
              in the NM-CRCM.  These programs enrich and are                                 
              integrated with the NM-CRCM science and math continuum.                        
              All collaborations include a true sharing of resources,                        
              trained personnel, and funding that ensures mutual                             
              benefit and integration.  All NM-CRCM collaborators have                       
              agreed to the NM-CRCM goals that are identified below.                         
                                                                                             
              During its prototype year, NM-CRCM has developed a                             
              statewide database of science and math progerams, K-16,                        
              that is available to students, teachers, and                                   
              administrators throughout New Mexico.  This databse now                        
              exists in hardcopy and will be disseminated through                            
              partnership with a New Mexico industry.  The database                          
              will eventually be placed on various computer bulletin                         
              boards so that schools or individuals with a modem may                         
              access the information.  The NM-CRCM will maintain the                         
              database, updating the hardcopy annually, and the                              
              database on a continual basis.                                                 
                                                                                             
              The project intends to bring its programs to at least                          
              80% of the rural school districts representing 35,000                          
              Native American and 40,000 Hispano ore-college students.
