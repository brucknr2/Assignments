Abstract    :
              A single-channel spectrograph currently used for astronomical                  
              spectroscopy introduces limitations into the kind and quality                  
              of experiments which may be performed, and is not                              
              representative of the ability of multichannel detectors which                  
              are becoming widespread in laboratory physics and especially in                
              astronomical imaging at many institutions.  The current                        
              experiments at Middlebury are being revised and improved using                 
              a modern, sensitive multichannel detector (CCD array camera)                   
              and extended to fainter astronomical objects, including solar                  
              system objects and the brighter stars.  This is done by the                    
              assembly of a bench-mounted spectrograph and an optical fiber                  
              feed from the telescope to the spectrograph.  The techniques                   
              and instruments developed make possible a wide variety of                      
              highly educational lab exercises for physics and astronomy                     
              undergraduates, and creates student-faculty research                           
              opportunities in the field of precision stellar radial                         
              velocities.  The instrumentation being developed emphasizes                    
              modularity and flexibility and is being documented and                         
              publicized in a manner that will help any institution with a                   
              modest telescope incorporate astronomical spectroscopy into its                
              undergraduate program.
