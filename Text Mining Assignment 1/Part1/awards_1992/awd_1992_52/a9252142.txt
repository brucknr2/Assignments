Abstract    :
              Several new biochemistry/molecular biology modules are being                   
              developed utilizing high performance liquid chromatography                     
              (HPLC) and associated sophisticated software to add                            
              quantification and open-ended investigative design to the                      
              present curriculum.  New experiments or extensions of present                  
              experiments, transferring current research of faculty into the                 
              laboratory, will include determination of the carbohydrate                     
              moiety of glycoproteins, fatty acid composition of membrane                    
              lipids, and sequencing of peptides.  In addition, undergraduate                
              independent study projects will now involve more current                       
              technology. The audience includes students in biochemistry,                    
              biophysics, genetics, and zoology, primarily in formal lab                     
              courses and independent research, non-majors in other life                     
              sciences departments, and secondary school teachers and                        
              students in special outreach programs of the Department of                     
              Biochemistry and Biophysics, such as NSF-Young Scholars and NIH                
              minority research apprentice programs.
