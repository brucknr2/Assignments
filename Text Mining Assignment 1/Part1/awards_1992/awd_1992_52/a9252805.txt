Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This camp, designed for Native American middle school students,                
              focuses on engineering, including electrical, ocean, civil, and                
              mechanical engineering.  Students will design wooden flutes, canoes,           
              model airplanes, and bridges.  The projects are chosen in part to have         
              some grounding in Native American culture.  The camp is integrated             
              into a local ongoing American Indian Science and Engineering Society           
              program which will keep the students in close contact with students            
              and faculty at the University.  The camp includes field trips to nearby        
              museums and industrial organizations and involves parents and the              
              community through Native American story telling activities.
