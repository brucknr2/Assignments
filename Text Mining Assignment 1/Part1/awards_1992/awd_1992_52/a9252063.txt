Abstract    :
              A multi-purpose Virology & Cell Culture Facility provides an                   
              opportunity for undergraduate students to develop technical                    
              expertise and to design projects (both in class and as                         
              independent study projects) that deal with animal viruses and                  
              cell culture.  Equipment includes: laminar flow hoods, inverted                
              microscopes, incubators, computers for data analysis and an                    
              ELISA microplate reader.  The facility is used mainly by                       
              students in Virology laboratories, but secondarily by students                 
              in eight other related classes.  It is shared with faculty on                  
              other campuses
