Abstract    :
                Within the last year, we have altered the undergraduate                      
              curriculum in plant pathology to reflect current technological                 
              advances in our science.  Three courses, Plant Virology,                       
              Mycology, and Bacterial Plant Pathogens, now make up the bulk                  
              of the undergraduate plant pathology curriculum.  All three                    
              laboratory courses are targeted for upgrading by this                          
              laboratory improvement plan.  We are improving laboratories                    
              specifically in the areas of video-assisted microscopy and                     
              molecular biotechnology. Studies of both molecular evolution                   
              and            changes in form and function with living                        
              materials are now possible.  We wish to create a curriculum                    
              that can be used as a model for teaching plant pathology at                    
              other institutions.
