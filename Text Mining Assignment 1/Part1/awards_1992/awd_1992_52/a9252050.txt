Abstract    :
              This project provides equipment to enhance the hands-on                        
              experimentation and data processing capabilities of the                        
              environmental sciences laboratory at Muskingum Area Technical                  
              College.  The equipment consists of six Hach spectrophotometers                
              interfaced with six personal computers; six wet chemistry labs                 
              are being established in the same facility to complete the                     
              enhancement.  The additional equipment will allow for more                     
              experiments and data collection and analysis to be completed by                
              students in seven different courses in the regular curriculum,                 
              and at least two of the special problems courses that are                      
              offered each year.  Muskingum Tech's environmental sciences                    
              program meets the training needs in a three county service                     
              district and beyond, and offers associates degrees in                          
              Environmental Resources Management (ERM) and Parks, Recreation,                
              and Wildlife (PRW).  Hands-on training is offered in spills                    
              management, resource management, water and air pollution                       
              control, hazardous materials management, groundwater hydrology,                
              and a variety of other areas.  Faculty members have designed a                 
              laboratory to maximize the potential use of space and of                       
              laboratory time to enhance the hands-on learning experience of                 
              students.  The result will be graduates who are better-prepared                
              for immediate employment or upper-division work.
