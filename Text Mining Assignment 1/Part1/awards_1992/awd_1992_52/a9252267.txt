Abstract    :
              The  Department of Geography, Geology and Planning at Southwest                
              Missouri State University is acquiring of two types of                         
              electromagnetic geophysical surveying equipment (very low                      
              frequency and dipole/dipole inductive).  The instruments are                   
              allowing students to perform data collection, processing and                   
              interpretation in a variety of geological environments                         
              including groundwater location and contamination studies.                      
              Their results are being integrated with other types of                         
              geophysical (gravity, magnetics, resistivity) data and                         
              geological data to obtain a better understanding of the                        
              strengths and weaknesses of the techniques.  Along with the                    
              department's electrical resistivity and gravity meter, the                     
              electromagnetic surveying equipment is providing students with                 
              the opportunity to experiment with the major geophyiscal                       
              methods used in groundwater and environmental studies.
