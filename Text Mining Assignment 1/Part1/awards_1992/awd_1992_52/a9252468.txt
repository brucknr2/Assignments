Abstract    :
              The project is adapting the University of Connecticut computer                 
              integrated calculus program to high school calculus courses                    
              under the University's High School Cooperative Calculus                        
              Program.  University of Connecticut faculty and graduate                       
              students, and teachers from thirteen Connecticut high schools                  
              will work together to rewrite materials, present these                         
              materials at summer workshops, and coordinate pilot testing of                 
              the materials.  Revisions based on the pilot testing will be                   
              made, and full scale field testing implemented.  Student                       
              performance in high school as well as subsequent performance at                
              the University will be carefully tracked.
