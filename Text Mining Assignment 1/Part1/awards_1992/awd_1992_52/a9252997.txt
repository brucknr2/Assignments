Abstract    :
                    This project will implement intensive teacher training                   
              enhancement for approximately 2,400 mathematics teachers of pre-               
              algebra, algebra, and geometry for eighth, ninth and tenth grade               
              students.  The teacher training activities, sponsored by a                     
              partnership between the College Board and the National Science                 
              Foundation, will take place at six sites in the United States:  Fort           
              Worth, Texas; Providence, Rhode Island; Nashville, Tennessee; Prince           
              George's County, Maryland; Milwaukee, Wisconsin; and San Jose,                 
              California.  The NSF-funded component of the partnership will                  
              involve more than 200,000 students and will involve teachers of                
              these students in a series of four-week summer institutes.  These              
              teacher-oriented institutes will be followed by workshops and                  
              seminars in the academic year subsequent to the respective summer              
              programs.  The partners in this venture will offer new and                     
              innovative mathematics curricula for students that focus on                    
              educational equity and design intensive institutes and workshops for           
              teachers to transmit the new curricula.  The principal investigator            
              of this project is well-qualified academically and has wide                    
              experiences in managing projects of this nature.
