Abstract    :
              Through a planning grant, Volunteer State Community College is                 
              coordinating a regional effort.  Based on surveys with the                     
              local rural high schools, critical aspects concerning                          
              mathematics instruction in the region will be identified.                      
              Through a series of workshops involving consultants, a regional                
              coalition strategy for improving the quality of math                           
              instruction will be developed.//
