Abstract    :
              A 300 MHz Fourier Transform Nuclear Magnetic Resonance                         
              Spectrometer (FTNMR) is being purchased for use throughout the                 
              chemistry curriculum, beginning in the first year.  In freshman                
              chemistry a simple reversible photolysis is being studied as a                 
              possible solar energy storage vehicle.  Sophomore organic                      
              chemistry students are using the instrument for mechanistic                    
              studies, indentification of compounds and undertaking multiple                 
              pulse sequence experiments.  Students in upper level courses                   
              are investigating phase changes, rotational barriers, reaction                 
              rates, equilibria, and advanced nmr techniques.
