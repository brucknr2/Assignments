Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              A Comprehensive Listing System is created to increase the                      
              amount of mathematics and science materials available in                       
              alternate formats including braille, large print, recorded,                    
              and electronic form in Canada and the United States for                        
              blind and print-disabled students in grades 3-14.  Four                        
              major organizations serving print-disabled persons in North                    
              America are adding their bibliographic information to both                     
              the APH-CARL and UNION national databases major databases                      
              serving Library of Congress users and institutions serving                     
              the blind and print-disabled.  The collaborative also                          
              invites more than 400 small publishers and colleges with                       
              Disabled Student Services (DSS) Offices on their campuses to                   
              contribute other titles not presently included on the                          
              database.  Materials are available in several languages to                     
              accommodate users' needs.  As a part of this project,                          
              Recording for the Blind (RFB) provides training to DSS                         
              offices on RFB standards for recording science and                             
              mathematics materials to ensure uniform quality.  They also                    
              train users, educators, and librarians on the new systems to                   
              increase use and minimize problems associated with the                         
              transition to college by print-disabled students.
