Abstract    :
              Western Illinois University is creating a Macintosh equipped                   
              classroom/laboratory to be used with Maple-based curricula                     
              materials in calculus and linear algebra.  These materials,                    
              which utilize the computer algebra system Maple, have been                     
              piloted in experimental sections of calculus with good results.                
              The faculty are revising and expanding the curricular                          
              materials.  More students are now being included in the                        
              laboratory approach to teaching calculus than was possible                     
              before this laboratory was established.
