Abstract    :
              The objectives of this proposal are to increase the conceptual                 
              understanding of students in introductory algebra and calculus-                
              based physics courses, and to make clearer at an earlier stage                 
              the connection between the scientific method and the physics                   
              lab.  This is being accomplished by introduction of Workshop                   
              Physics and microcomputer-based laboratory curricula.  Five                    
              Macintosh LC's provide the heart of the new physics lab, and a                 
              host of probes interfaced with the computers allows the                        
              students to gather and reduce data for further analysis.                       
              Students learn almost all of their physics from these labs,                    
              effectively eliminating lectures.
