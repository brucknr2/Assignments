Abstract    :
              The goal of this project is to restructure the General                         
              Experimental Psychology (GEP) course (60 percent non-majors;                   
              60% female enrollment) to give all students a more                             
              comprehensive, research-intensive view of psychology.  To                      
              accomplish this objective, five modules (each containing menus                 
              of projects that share common equipment and protocol) are                      
              designed to permit a greater number of projects and more                       
              individualized instruction.  Students will select projects from                
              each module which are presented in a developmentally-oriented                  
              progression.  The initial modules offer group projects that are                
              more prescriptive, obliging each student to practice skills                    
              that are necessary in later, more independent projects                         
              available in subsequent modules.  Computerizing and networking                 
              the laboratory will serve to increase the menu of available                    
              research projects and is the basis for a complete                              
              reorganization of this course into the core of a program                       
              designed to produce independent researchers.  It will enable                   
              students to design, conduct, analyze, write-up, and print                      
              research projects using the same equipment, often within the                   
              time limits of class sessions.  By presenting their projects                   
              during discussion sessions, all will benefit from a diverse                    
              view of each area of research.
