Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This project will develop a set of teaching materials to                       
              accompany the multimedia, videodisc package:  Physics:                         
              Cinema Classics.  Classroom teachers recognized as leaders                     
              within their profession will write and test the materials.                     
              The three two-sided videodiscs are organized by themes and                     
              fully indexed with bar codes for ease of use.  The teaching                    
              materials will provide an overview of the videodisc text,                      
              the physics concepts being covered, teaching ideas, and                        
              laboratory exercises.  A student assessment instrument will                    
              be developed and tested by project personnel to evaluate the                   
              students' conceptual knowledge.  Field testing will also                       
              occur at sites with inexperienced teachers and high levels                     
              of minorities to determine the usefulness of the materials                     
              for a wide range of teacher skill and training.                                
                                                                                             
              Distribution will occur through a commercial publisher being                   
              selected by the American Association of Physics Teachers                       
              (AAPT).  Project personnel will provide training on the use                    
              of the complete set of the materials at a series of regional                   
              and national AAPT conferences.
