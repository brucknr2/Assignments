Abstract    :
              The Department of Chemistry is combining two work stations and                 
              two computers and a variety of software for a laboratory                       
              facility to support the instructional program in computational                 
              chemistry/molecular modeling for several upper-level chemistry                 
              courses.  Emphasis is on acquiring a versatile system that                     
              permits undergraduate students to carry out the sophisticated                  
              calculations and molecular manipulations that are now routine                  
              in research settings.  These include realistic quantum and                     
              molecular mechanics calculations for small molecules, including                
              simple inorganic and organic compounds and metal containing                    
              organometallic and coordination compounds, and molecular                       
              mechanics and molecular dynamics calculations for the large                    
              molecules that are central to a clear understanding of modern                  
              biochemistry/molecular biology.  The graphical display of these                
              models is a central feature of the facility and of the                         
              instructional applications being developed.
