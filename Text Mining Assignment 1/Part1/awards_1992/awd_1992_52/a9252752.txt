              Program at Trinity College offers a five-week program which                    
              integrates instruction in the sciences, mathematics,                           
              computer applications, guidance and career counseling and

              underrepresented minority rising eighth and ninth grade                        
              students take grade appropriate courses and participate on                     
              field trips.  The program employs a hands-on approach to                       
              mathematics and science education.  Learning experiences are                   
              designed to involve students actively in science inquiry and                   
              mathematics as an integral aspect of investigation.                            
              Professionals from the science, engineering and mathematics                    
              community serve as role models and mentors.
