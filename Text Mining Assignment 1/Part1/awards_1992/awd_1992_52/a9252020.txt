Abstract    :
              The Department of Chemistry is purchasing a Fourier Transform                  
              infrared spectrophotometer, a mass spectrometer and                            
              constructing a stainless steel vacuum system for the study of                  
              surface science.  The instruments are also being used in the                   
              organic chemistry laboratories and analytical chemistry                        
              students are using them in investigations of polymers and                      
              automobile exhaust pollutants and heterogeneous catalytic                      
              reactions.  Participants in the undergraduate research program                 
              are also using the equipment in their investigations.
