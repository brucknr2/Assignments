Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This proposal requests funds to pull together existing data and                
              information on the impact of from 7 to 9 selected past and current             
              projects funded through DMDRI in the area of mathematics.  This                
              data must be collected through questionnaires completed and                    
              interviews with project p.I.'s, publishers, school personnel and               
              others.  The project P.I.'s are college faculty, publishing                    
              corporation representatives, researchers, directors of informal                
              science instructional facilities and officers of professional                  
              organizations all having concern for the improvement of mathematics            
              education at the pre-college level.                                            
                                                                                             
              The results of these impact studies, to be presented in a written              
              report, will serve DMDRI in setting direction for future funding               
              and in designing more complete studies in the future
