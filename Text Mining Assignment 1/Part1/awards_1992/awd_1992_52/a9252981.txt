Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Worldwide, there is great and justifiable concern about                        
              global climate and environmental change; in the United                         
              States there is also justifiable concern over lack of                          
              science literacy.  Both issues will be addressed through the                   
              development of this curriculum.  Materials will be developed                   
              for a course in earth systems science for upper-level high                     
              school students.  Logistically, curriculum materials will                      
              build on the sophisticated, low-cost, monitoring technology                    
              already developed by TERC.  Conceptually, these materials                      
              will use a constructivist approach (hands-on, active                           
              learning, including real research) to illustrate the                           
              principles of systems and classical ecology.  The curriculum                   
              will address several important concerns in science                             
              education, and will empower students to understand the                         
              dynamic and interactive nature of ecosystems.                                  
                                                                                             
              The modules will be earth-science/ecologically oriented,                       
              integrated with several other sciences, and developed for                      
              the upper high school level student.  The materials are                        
              designed to be integrated into existing curricula.
