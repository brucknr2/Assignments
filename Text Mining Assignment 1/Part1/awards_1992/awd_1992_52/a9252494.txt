Abstract    :
              Five private and five public colleges and universities located                 
              within or at the western boundary of appalachia and having an                  
              aggregate student body of over 60,000 are promoting the                        
              implementation of modern calculus curricula in their region by:                
              (1)  developing and achieving full implementation of calculus                  
              programs at their own institutions and (2)  sharing the                        
              knowledge and experience gained through an extensive program of                
              dissemination directed at both high schools and sister                         
              institutions.  The availability, within the region, of a large,                
              documented, widely disseminated sample of successful approaches                
              and implementations is expected to motivate, encourage, and                    
              facilitate similar efforts at other regional colleges and                      
              universities.  The latter, combined with programs to inform and                
              involve high school teachers of calculus will contribute to the                
              further extension of a revised calculus in the schools.  In                    
              addition to workshops, consortium communication will be                        
              facilitated through an electronic network.
