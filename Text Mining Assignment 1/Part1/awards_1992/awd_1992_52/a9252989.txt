Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Project VISTA (VIsual/Spatial Thinking Activities) is a                        
              curriculum development/research project designed to produce                    
              a bank of enrichment/enhancement science-oriented VST                          
              learning activities for grades K-8.  University science                        
              educators, scientists, cognitive psychologists and                             
              educational technologists will collaborate with 36 exemplary                   
              Teacher Associates to develop and refine Project VISTA                         
              activities over a phased three-year period.                                    
                                                                                             
              The project will produce the following outcomes:  1) a                         
              baseline of assessed VST abilities for children in grades K-                   
              8; 2)  a battery of new VST assessment instruments; 3) a                       
              large collection of innovative VST science learning                            
              activities, including hands-on experiences, interactive                        
              videotape-based experiences, computer-based experiences, and                   
              inquiring demonstrations.  These enrichment materials will                     
              be made available nationally to build upon and supplement                      
              all existing K-8 science programs.
