Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The Technology Summer Camp provides an environmental science                   
              and engineering program for rising ninth grade African-American,               
              Hispanic, Native-American and Pacific Islander students.  The camp             
              involves students, through group interactive activities, in the                
              excitement of the process of science and engineering and will                  
              expose them to a wide variety of career options and mentoring                  
              experiences.  The program's goal is to encourage students to pursue            
              rigorous math and science training in high school and to begin                 
              considering the many options for scientific and technological                  
              education at the university level, as well as to make students                 
              more aware of science and technology as a social endeavor.
