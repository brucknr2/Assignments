Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Classroom ready materials on agriculture related mathematics                   
              will be developed by a team of authors consisting of eastern                   
              washington secondary teachers, Washington State University                     
              professors, and non-academic members of the agriculture                        
              industry.  The materials will be designed to supplement                        
              existing secondary mathematics classes and will include                        
              student work pages, computer exercises, cooperative learning                   
              projects and a video tape informing students of the important                  
              role of mathematics in agriculture.  Some material will be                     
              written to include parental involvement.                                       
                                                                                             
              The materials will be based on information gathered from                       
              practicing agriculture professionals in eastern Washington and                 
              will be piloted in six districts.  Additional teachers will be                 
              trained to use the materials during a one-weak conference and                  
              through courses taught at the three branch campuses of                         
              Washington State University.  A  communicating network of 80-                  
              100 teachers will result which will help address problems of                   
              isolation in rural districts.
