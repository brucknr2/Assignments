Abstract    :
              This project is to develop a Process Instrumentation and                       
              Control laboratory which will complement an undergraduate                      
              control course, with the same title, which is the main course                  
              in the Controls Option at this Institution.  The project is                    
              focused on practical process control loop design and                           
              implementation using modern instrumentation.  The goal is that                 
              after completing the course with the laboratory, the students                  
              will have learned practical as well as theoretical aspects of                  
              process control.  To this end, a network of six PCs equipped                   
              with data acquisition cards will be purchased for both software                
              analysis and design and for controlling dynamic systems using                  
              digital computers.  Typical transducers will be introduced and                 
              specific processes and systems will be controlled using                        
              commercially available instrumentation, actuators and                          
              controllers.  The project will also enable the introduction to                 
              the students of programmable logic controllers, as used                        
              extensively in industry today.
