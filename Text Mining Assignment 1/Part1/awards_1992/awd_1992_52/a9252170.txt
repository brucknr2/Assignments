Abstract    :
              Interactive PC-Based Scanning Electron MicroscopyThis project                  
              develops an innovative laboratory for the teaching of scanning                 
              electron microscopy (SEM).  Although SEM is one of the most                    
              heavily used and depended upon of all analytical techniques in                 
              the materials field, it has been extremely difficult to teach                  
              because of the single-user nature of SEM instruments up to now.                
              The laboratory consists of a network of PC-based engineering                   
              workstations linked to a state-of-the-art SEM, and provides up                 
              to 20 or more students with direct, simultaneous, interactive                  
              access to the SEM.  All controls, functions, and features of                   
              SEM, and all image and data analysis software and control are                  
              available at each workstation.  This approach allows                           
              undergraduates extended exposure to advanced SEM methodologies.
