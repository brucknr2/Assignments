Abstract    :
              The Department of Chemistry is acquiring a capillary gas                       
              chromatography-mass spectrometer system, associated computer                   
              equipment, and a library database.  The system is allowing both                
              chemistry majors and nonmajors to become familiar with the use                 
              of computer integrated instrumentation, data analysis, and                     
              database searching.  Students at the sophomore through senior                  
              levels are carrying out experiments using the instrument in                    
              courses including organic chemistry, inorganic chemistry, and                  
              instrumental analysis, as well as in an intensive Environmental                
              Chemistry Institute and in a variety of undergraduate research                 
              projects.
