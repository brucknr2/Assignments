Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Xavier University of Louisiana and the University of New Orleans               
              propose to establish a Research Careers for Minority Scholars                  
              program for the purpose of recruiting promising high school                    
              graduates and currently enrolled students who will commit to                   
              pursuing graduate study in science or engineering.  The proposed               
              program will identify selected students and provide them with                  
              undergraduate and graduate teaching and research advisors, help in             
              obtaining summer research internships, and financial aid in                    
              sufficient quantity so as to facilitate student success.  The                  
              unique feature of the proposed project is the development of a                 
              Graduate Dual Degree (Bachelor of Science and Master of Science)               
              arrangement between Xavier University (for undergraduate degrees)              
              and the University of New Orleans (for graduate degrees) in                    
              chemistry, computer science, mathematics, physics, and engineering.            
              Those students pursuing engineering careers will receive both the              
              Bachelor of Science and Master of Science degree from the                      
              University of New Orleans.  Structurally, this program is unique               
              not only in its ability to provide students an opportunity to                  
              obtain an undergraduate and a graduate degree, but also, in a time             
              frame which is reduced by one year from the traditional approach.              
              Numerically, we expect this proposed project ultimately to increase            
              the minority pool of doctoral candidates in the sciences by                    
              approximately 20% on a nation-wide basis.  The amount requested                
              from the National Science Foundation for this project is $2,363,08             
              or only $10,503 per year per student to obtain a Bachelors and                 
              Masters Degree in either Chemistry, Computer Science, Mathematics              
              Physics, or Engineering.  University cost sharing is set at an                 
              additional $776,168.
