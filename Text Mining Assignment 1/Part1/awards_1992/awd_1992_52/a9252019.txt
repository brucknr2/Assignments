Abstract    :
              A computerized classroom is being developed to serve primarily                 
              Calculus, but also Linear Algebra, and Differential Equations.                 
              PCs are being networked to a file server with several                          
              selections of software.  Innovative materials have been                        
              developed and there has been considerable experience using                     
              these materials and modern software.  Through this grant, these                
              two formats are combined to bring a hands-on computer                          
              environment to the classroom.  Students are now able to explore                
              mathematics at a level of depth and excitement not before                      
              possible.
