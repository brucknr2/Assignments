Abstract    :
              A laboratory is being established for measurement and process                  
              control combining four disciplines--electronic,                                
              water/wastewater, pulp and paper technology, and physics.  The                 
              laboratory is equipped with self-contained workstations                        
              designed for hands-on applications of the measurement, control                 
              and troubleshooting of pressure, flow, level, temperature, heat                
              exchangers, and analytic process loops.  Experiments involve                   
              mechanical, physical, chemical, electronic, pneumatic,                         
              measurement, mathematical, spatial relations, and abstract                     
              reasoning disciplines.
