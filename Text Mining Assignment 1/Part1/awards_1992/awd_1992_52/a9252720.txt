Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This award is a Career Advancement Award in the Minority Research              
              Initiation program at the National Science Foundation.  The                    
              researcher is a Hispanic faculty member at SUNY-Albany who will                
              use the award to study some quantitative analytical techniques                 
              and theories of data analysis.  This will significantly advance                
              her capacity to do path-breaking research in her field of                      
              economic anthropology, a field in which she already has several                
              publications.
