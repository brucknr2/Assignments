Abstract    :
              The Chemistry Department is purchasing equipment for CHEMTREK                  
              II, a second generation, year-long, freshman chemistry majors                  
              program which combines small-scale chemistry with computer-                    
              interfaced experiments and simulations, a new type of small-                   
              scale quantitative spectrophotometric instrumentation, and                     
              video-enhanced problem-solving techniques.  The major equipment                
              items are microplate spectophotometric readers (for small-scale                
              quantitative spectrophotometric measurements), computers with                  
              interfaces, software and, printers, and a microscope camera                    
              system for recording small-scale phenomena.  This program                      
              brings together students with common goals to develop new and                  
              innovative experiments, maximizes faculty-beginning student                    
              interactions.  The goal of the program is to motivate beginning                
              chemistry majors and to integrate theory, practice, and                        
              applications of chemistry in the undergraduate curriculum.
