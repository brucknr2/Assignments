Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This three-year project aims at preparing high school                          
              mathematics teachers nationwide to integrate the use of                        
              graphing calculators and symbolic manipulation software into                   
              their teaching of calculus.  At the same time, the project                     
              also serves to disseminate instructional materials that                        
              integrate the use of such technology into the teaching of                      
              calculus (Oregon State University Calculus Project).                           
              Participating teachers will attend intensive two-week summer                   
              workshops offered at several sites around the country.                         
              During the following academic year these teachers will                         
              implement the new calculus program in their respective                         
              schools.  In this endeavor, they will be supported by a                        
              variety of communication networks (including electronic                        
              ones), as well as periodic two-day regional follow-up                          
              meetings.  The cognitive and affective factors involved in                     
              learning and teaching calculus with technology will be                         
              studied.  The evaluation component will focus on student and                   
              teacher outcomes, with special emphasis on student                             
              participation and performance in subsequent college                            
              mathematics courses.  A "leadership" component of the                          
              program will provide special training to 25 teachers aimed                     
              at preparing them to initiate in-service efforts around the                    
              country that involve calculus and technology.  The percentage of               
              matching funds is 67%
