Abstract    :
              Contemporary techniques in cell and molecular biology are tools                
              used to solve problems in all biological sub-disciplines and                   
              are an integral component of laboratory classes in Cell                        
              Biology, Molecular Biology, and Genetics.  With the new                        
              equipment these classes will utilize Southern, Northern, and                   
              Western analysis, genetic mosaic analysis, DNA transformation,                 
              polymerase chain reaction and immunofluorescence microscopy in                 
              their studies.  All Colorado College biology majors take at                    
              least two of these courses.  The equipment is also available to                
              independent undergraduate research courses and senior thesis                   
              projects. Students participating in independent or                             
              collaborative research projects are encouaged to present and                   
              publish their findings. The requested equipment will allow the                 
              Department to fulfill its plan to expand its offerings and                     
              provide students with hands-on experience in the growing field                 
              of biotechnology.
