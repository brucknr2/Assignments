Abstract    :
              A multidisciplinary Graphics Workstation Laboratory for                        
              students in Geology, Chemistry, Physics, Biology and Astronomy                 
              is being developed. It consists of a central fileserver and 20                 
              high resolution color graphics workstations. Major and non-                    
              major science students utilize computer technology for                         
              individual study, supervised research projects and laboratory                  
              work.  The laboratory  supports the integration of faculty and                 
              student and enhances interactive learning.  The equipment will                 
              affect 27 courses and provides the direction for further                       
              curricular development.
