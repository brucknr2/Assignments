Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The National Science Resources Center (NSRC) will join with                    
              the National Academy of Sciences and the Smithsonian                           
              Institution to bring together teachers, educators and                          
              scientists with a great diversity and richness of experience                   
              to create and disseminate an innovative elementary science                     
              program for grades one through six called Science and                          
              Technology for Children (STC).                                                 
                                                                                             
              Twelve hands-on, inquiry-centered units will be produced and                   
              disseminated by the project; these units plus the twelve                       
              units the STC project already has produced will constitute a                   
              complete elementary science program for grades one through                     
              six.  In addition, 16 science readers will be developed to                     
              complement the 16 STC units for grades three through six.                      
              School districts will be able to use these materials either                    
              as a complete elementary science program or individually, as                   
              a supplement to an existing science program.                                   
                                                                                             
              These materials will be designed to meet the needs of                          
              elementary school children from diverse cultural and ethnic                    
              backgrounds.
