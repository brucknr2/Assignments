Abstract    :
              Triton College is developing a computer-integrated engineering                 
              classroom.  The computers will be used primarily for the                       
              teaching of three mechanics courses:  Statics, Dynamics, and                   
              Strength of Materials.  The software used will include software                
              written and tested at the College as well as commercially                      
              available software including symbolic manipulasators and                       
              special purpose structural analysis programs. The classroom                    
              will initially be equipped with 12 computers, with two students                
              per computer.The computers will be used during class time to                   
              allow the faculty to improve visualization skills as well as to                
              allow students to solve problems which require the variation of                
              several parameters.  Students will be assigned traditional                     
              homework problems as well as projects which will entail the use                
              of computers. Evaluation of the project will be performed via                  
              a test data bank, which was developed with a previous NSF                      
              grant.
