Abstract    :
              This project provides equipment for a new hardware laboratory                  
              designed to allow students to develop the skills of critical                   
              analysis, careful reasoning, creativity, and self-expression.                  
              The laboratory will include ten laboratory stations based on                   
              Macintosh computers and equipped with oscilloscopes, logic                     
              probes, and prototyping hardware and software to explore the                   
              use and construction of computer hardware.
