Abstract    :
              A Computer-Assisted Laboratory for Physics and Calculus                        
              (CALPAC) is being developed to integrate the subjects of                       
              freshman physics and calculus.  CALPAC seeks solutions to the                  
              compartmentalization syndrome from which students generally                    
              suffer and the low retention rate faced in physics, mathematics                
              and the dual-degree program which are attributed to entry-level                
              courses.  Freshmen, with the help of computers and under the                   
              guidance of the faculty, explore and discover major concepts in                
              calculus, mechanics and electromagnetism, and in so doing                      
              enhance their ability to develop mathematical intuition and                    
              understand physical concepts.  Students are given a set of                     
              basic questions to explore, and in the process are exposed to                  
              the necessary computer, mathematical and experimental tools.                   
              CALPAC meets daily as inquiry workshops, experimentation and                   
              design sessions, problem solving seminars, and synthesis                       
              meetings.
