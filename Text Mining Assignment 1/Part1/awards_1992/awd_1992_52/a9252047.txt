Abstract    :
              This Department of Chemistry is purchasing a gas chromatograph                 
              for use by students in the organic chemistry laboratory,                       
              general chemistry laboratory, and other courses in the                         
              chemistry curriculum.  Use of the gas chromatograph, in                        
              addition to other instruments, aids students in learning to                    
              design experiments, in utilizing instrumental methods of                       
              analysis, and in learning to evaluate experimental results.                    
              These skills will prepare students to do undergraduate,                        
              graduate, or industrial research.  Students use the instrument                 
              in organic laboratory courses in which they design experimental                
              paths and cooperate in self-evaluation and peer evaluation of                  
              the experimental results.
