Abstract    :
              The teaching of mechanics of human motion is being enhanced                    
              through the use of a video/computer motion analysis system. The                
              equipment used for the project is the complete Peak Performance                
              Two-Dimensional System consisting of a core, computer                          
              subsystem, video subsystem, and automatic point tracking                       
              module.  With this equipment, it is possible to produce graphic                
              and digital illustrations of the mechanical concepts taught in                 
              undergraduate courses in anatomy and kinesiology and                           
              biomechanics.  This system permits introduction of laboratory                  
              experimentation in these courses.  In addition, the ease and                   
              affordability of working with videotape provide opportunities                  
              for student projects.
