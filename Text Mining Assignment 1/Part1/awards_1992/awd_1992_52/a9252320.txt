Abstract    :
              This project will extend the current capabilities in the                       
              Electrical Engineering laboratories in the areas of automated                  
              computer measurements and control. Hardware and software will                  
              be acquired to permit measurements to be made of such                          
              parameters as temperature, strain, the flow of liquids, and the                
              characteristics of liquids. The system will also allow students                
              to control and interface with a much wider range of motors,                    
              valves, sensors, and a vision system. It will provide students                 
              with a rich environment in which to develop various circuits to                
              perform relevant tasks in measurement and control. The overall                 
              project is planned so as to equip students to make meaningful                  
              contributions in such areas as manufacturing, chemical process                 
              control, and pollution monitoring.
