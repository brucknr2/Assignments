Abstract    :
              Sixteen one week workshops, eight in the summer of 1993 and                    
              eight more in the summer of 1994, are being held at sites                      
              geographically distributed throughout the country.  Each                       
              workshop will have 24 participants from high schools, two and                  
              four year colleges, and universities.  Workshop leaders will be                
              drawn from the ranks of those who have led the reform movement.                
              The leaders will illustrate the use of the particular materials                
              and methods they have developed and prepare participants for                   
              obstacles that confront curricular reform. Participants will                   
              engage in the activities of a particular approach to reform,                   
              consider the criticisms that led to the calculus reform                        
              movement, be presented with a national overview of curricular                  
              reform, and be asked to reflect on the goals and expectations                  
              they bring to teaching the course.  They will then be asked to                 
              consider their own situation and to formulate a plan for action                
              in their home institution.
