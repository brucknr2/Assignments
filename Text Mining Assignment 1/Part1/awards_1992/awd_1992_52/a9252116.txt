Abstract    :
              The Science Department is purchasing a Fourier transform                       
              infrared spectrophotometer for use in the sophomore organic                    
              chemistry courses.  As a result of the acquisition, the                        
              laboratory is undergoing a revision to include experiments                     
              involving both qualitative and semi-quantitative analyses.  The                
              changes in the laboratory are smoothing the transition for                     
              students transferring to science programs at four year                         
              institutions.
