Abstract    :
               The new Social and Behavioral Sciences Computer Laboratory at                 
              the New Community College of Baltimore will introduce students                 
              to computer-based social science research.  Although science is                
              central to the social sciences, introductory courses typically                 
              offer static recitations of conventional social science                        
              knowledge, whereas what students need to learn are the methods                 
              of scientific inquiry.  The curricular plan for the lab is                     
              based on this and three other realities of higher education for                
              the 21st century: 1) adult students learn differently from                     
              their younger counterparts; 2) higher education must develop                   
              self-directed learners; and 3) Students must become computer                   
              literate.  Higher education is attracting older students with                  
              life experience who achieve better when they complete real                     
              tasks, as opposed to simulation and exercises.  This kind of                   
              self-directed scientific inquiry is the centerpiece of the                     
              Social Science department's curricular renaissance, which                      
              includes the conversion of introductory social science classes                 
              from lecture courses to science lab courses.
