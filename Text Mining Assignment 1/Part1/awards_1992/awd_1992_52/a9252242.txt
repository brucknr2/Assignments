Abstract    :
              This project will establish one General Chemistry laboratory                   
              with twelve workstations equipped with microcomputers and                      
              interface units.  The workstations interface the microcomputer                 
              with sensors that function as a voltmeter, ammeter, pH meter,                  
              light detector, or thermometer.  The computer allows students                  
              to control the experiment, collect and analyze the data, and                   
              obtain real-time results.  Interfaced microcomputers provide                   
              valuable experience for students in functional uses of                         
              computers.  Second, properly designed experiments encourage in-                
              depth thought resulting in better understanding of experiments                 
              and, hence, chemistry.  The units will be also be used in a                    
              summer institute for high school chemistry teachers.
