Abstract    :
              Project Calc, developed through an NSF grant to Duke                           
              University, is being implemented at the University of                          
              Mississippi.  Materials are being adapted for the                              
              implementation at this institution, including the use of                       
              alternative software.  These materials will be made available                  
              for other institutions, as well as types and levels of  support                
              necessary for faculty and graduate assistants to effectively                   
              use these materials and approaches.  In addition to providing                  
              a model for implementation at a comprehensive state                            
              institution, this project will serve as a test site for the                    
              Mississippi Alliance for Minority Participation.
