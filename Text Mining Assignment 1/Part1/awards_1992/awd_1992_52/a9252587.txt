Abstract    :
              A course on technological invention and design is being                        
              developed to meet the needs of both liberal arts and                           
              engineering students. A collaborative learning environment is                  
              being developed in which faculty and students from different                   
              disciplines will work and study together. The case studies will                
              be widely disseminated nationally.
