Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This project will create a set of 100-200 haptic diagrams in                   
              the area of life science for use by blind, visually                            
              impaired, learning disabled, and at risk students, grades                      
              3-7.  These raised line diagrams will utilize differing                        
              textures and brailled labels along with auditory tapes,                        
              brailled text, and ink print text to provide further                           
              information about the content of the diagram.  Teachers will                   
              be able to select from the available materials to respond to                   
              the learning modalities of students found in a mainstreamed                    
              classroom.  Supplemental print materials for the teacher                       
              will provide follow-up activities that are designed to                         
              engage print-disabled students in hands-on, inquiry                            
              learning.  These materials are intended for use in                             
              cooperative learning settings in the regular education                         
              classroom to decrease the isolation of disabled students and                   
              increase their interest and participation in science.                          
                                                                                             
              The topics for the diagrams will be selected for their                         
              compatibility with the most commonly used science textbooks                    
              and with the overarching themes of Science For All                             
              Americans.  Topics will include earth science, biology,                        
              ecology, and human biology.                                                    
                                                                                             
              The materials will be field tested over two years in                           
              California, Texas, New York, and Kentucky.  Dissemination                      
              will occur through the National Science Teachers                               
              Association, the "Special Net" system of the United States                     
              Resource Centers and Clearinghouses, and presentations made                    
              at national conferences for science teachers and teachers of                   
              blind and visually impaired students.
