Abstract    :
              The objective of this multi-disciplinary project is to improve                 
              the quality of science instruction at Muscatine Community                      
              College through the introduction of computers into the                         
              laboratory environment.  The physics, chemistry, astronomy, and                
              meteorology programs are sharing a computer network for use by                 
              transfer as well as technical students enrolled in physics,                    
              astronomy, meteorology, and/or chemistry courses.  The                         
              laboratory, equipped with Macintosh LC II computers, is used in                
              conjunction with existing laboratory instrumentation to enhance                
              data collection and analysis.  It also promotes the transfer of                
              knowledge and procedures from one discipline to another.
