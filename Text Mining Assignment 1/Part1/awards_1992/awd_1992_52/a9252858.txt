Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The State University of New York College at                                    
              Fredonia sponsors the "Pathways of Mathematics and                             
              Sciences Summer Project" for minority students                                 
              annually from three target schools.  This five-week                            
              commuter project provides unique learning                                      
              experiences in mathematics and science to encourage                            
              students to continue the study of math and science,                            
              to realize the importance of these subjects in                                 
              their everyday lives and appreciate that both are                              
              interesting and enjoyable.  The summer project has                             
              three modules:  I) Knowing the Coursework; II)                                 
              Knowing Yourself; and III) Knowing the School                                  
              System.  The mathematics content includes science                              
              content inlcudes ecology, environmental geology                                
              and mineralogy.  Instructional activities involve                              
              hands-on, independent study, intensive lab use,                                
              work stations, and field trips.  Problem solving,                              
              communication, reasoning, and connection provide                               
              students with stimulating conditions for learning                              
              mathematics and science.  Community and                                        
              institutional support are strong.
