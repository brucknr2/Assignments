Abstract    :
              The Women in Engineering Advocates Network (WEPAN) is a national               
              organization that provides access for women to careers in engineering          
              by increasing the number of women enrolling and successfully completing        
              degrees in engineering at both the undergraduate and graduate levels.          
              WEPAN provides technical assistance to educational institutions                
              desiring to initiate or expand Women in Engineering Programs.  WEPAN           
              is involved in:  1) providing technical assistance to aid and encourage        
              engineering schools in establishing or expanding Women in Engineering          
              Programs; 2) establishing executive committees in each of the three            
              regions (western, midwestern, and eastern United States) to facilitate         
              training for institutions and to establish partnerships between                
              educational institutions and industries; 3) conducting regional                
              training seminars; 4) furthering development of the National Evaluation        
              of Women in Engineering Programs; and 5) continuing to provide                 
              leadership to the national WEPAN organization.
