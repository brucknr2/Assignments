Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The Hampton University sponsors a four-week Summer Science                     
              camp annually for the same group of forty-eight rising                         
              seventh grade minority students.  Program activities                           
              include:  1) instruction in geometry, probability, and                         
              statistics in experimental mode with emphasis on scientific                    
              research methodology, supplemented with problem-solving,                       
              problem-solving techniques, the graphic calculator and                         
              computer usage; 2) enrichment experiences such as study                        
              skills and writing for success in mathematics; alleviation                     
              of mathematics anxiety; guest speakers who discuss career                      
              options in mathematics and local field trips to business and                   
              professional operations.  Parents play an active role by                       
              providing after school and weekend help for the student on                     
              the basis of their own program orientation training.                           
              Follow-up activities include minds-on, hands-on activities                     
              developed and presented by students using the skills and                       
              techniques acquired during the summer program as well as                       
              additional classroom-laboratory activities.
