Abstract    :
              Freshman Engineering students at Rancho Santiago Community                     
              College are using Three-Dimensional Solid Modeling in their                    
              Graphic Design courses.  Computer-aided design has been taught                 
              at Rancho Santiago since 1983.  Emerging curriculum models have                
              identified Three-Dimensional Solid Modeling, using computer                    
              graphics technologies, as the dominant engineering tool for the                
              90s.  The College's Engineering faculty have investigated the                  
              use of solid modeling by engineers and developed curriculum and                
              laboratory manuals for this subject.  The new PCAT 486-MHz                     
              Microcomputer Systems allow making the laboratory on this                      
              subject a requirement for all Engineering majors.  The                         
              curriculum and laboratory materials are also incorporated into                 
              four engineering design classes.  Applications will include                    
              two-dimensional and three-dimensional Boolean geometry                         
              operations, creating solids, camera walk, presentation and                     
              rendering, editing, plotting, and annotation.
