Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The scientific community is challenged by the need to reach                    
              out to students who have traditionally not been attracted to                   
              engineering and the sciences.  This project would provide a                    
              link between the University of Michigan and the teachers and                   
              students of secondary education in the State of Michigan                       
              with an initial emphasis on southeast Michigan, through the                    
              creation of a range of computer services which will provide                    
              interactive access to current weather and climate change                       
              information.  Taking advantage of a unique computer network                    
              capacity within the State of Michigan named MichNet which                      
              provides local phone ports in virtually every major city in                    
              the state, and the resources available to the university                       
              community via the University Corporation for Atmospheric                       
              Research (UCAR) UNIDATA program, this project would provide                    
              secondary schools with access to a state-of-the-art                            
              interactive weather information system.  The real-time data                    
              available via the system, supplemented by interactive                          
              computer modules designed in collaboration with earth                          
              science teachers, will provide animated background                             
              information on a range of climate and weather related                          
              topics.  While the principal objective of this project will                    
              be to provide educationally stimulating interactive computer                   
              systems and electronic weather and climate modules for                         
              application in inner city Detroit and its environs, the                        
              unique nature of the available computer networking will                        
              allow virtually every school system in the state to have                       
              access.  Subsequently successful completion of this project                    
              could eventually make the same systems available to other                      
              cities and states.
