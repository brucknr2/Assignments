Abstract    :
               An integrated three-course sequence of introductory college                   
              mathematics is being developed.  Areas of mathematics                          
              encompassed include: algebra, trigonometry, differential and                   
              integral calculus, sequences and recurrence relations,                         
              probability and statistics, and logic.  A laboratory including                 
              personal computers equipped with advanced mathematical software                
              with graphics (including animation), symbolic manipulation,                    
              word processing, and user-friendly programming capabilities is                 
              being developed.Changes in delivery include cooperative                        
              learning in small groups and an emphasis on student                            
              exploration, including open-ended assignments frequently                       
              involving applications.  Writing is being stressed, and                        
              evaluation of it will be part of feedback through regular                      
              collection and review of homework.
