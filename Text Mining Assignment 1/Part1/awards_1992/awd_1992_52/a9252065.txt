Abstract    :
              Muskingum College is developing microcomputer-based laboratory                 
              exercises and equipment that enhances all of its physics                       
              laboratory courses.  The present instrumentation is being                      
              augmented by precision position monitors, light sensors and                    
              spectrometers connected to Macintosh and MS-DOS computers.                     
              Curricula are being written for using this equipment in all                    
              lower division physics courses, including a new workshop-type                  
              course designed for pre-service teachers.  Physics students are                
              constructing and calibrating the spectrometers as part of an                   
              upper-division laboratory course.  New microcomputer-based                     
              exercises that incorporate a CCD imaging camera and telescope                  
              are being created for the introductory astronomy laboratory.
