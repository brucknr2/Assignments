Abstract    :
                   This proposal requests funds to enable ten classroom teachers             
              to conduct in-depth research projects in teaching and learning in              
              their classrooms and to provide the necessary support and mentoring            
              activities for them to plan, carry out, document, write up, and                
              share the results of their research.  The proposed teacher research            
              projects fall under three general headings: a) The effects of a                
              visual mathematics curriculum on student learning; b) The effects              
              of self assessment on student learning; and c) Comparisons of                  
              teacher perceptions vs. student perceptions of particular classroom            
              issues.  Monthly meetings in the fall of 1991 have been held to                
              plan and focus the teacher research projects.  Classroom research              
              projects will be conducted by the teachers for the period of                   
              January to June 1992.  During the summer of 1992, a week long                  
              workshop with the teachers will be held in order to share and write            
              up the results of their research projects.  At the end of the                  
              summer workshop the teacher-researchers will each choose a                     
              colleague from their school to form a research dyad for the 1992-              
              1993 school year.  Results of the teacher-research projects will be            
              shared by the teachers in their own schools, at the Oregon Math                
              Leaders Conference in summer of 1992, and at the Northwest                     
              Mathematics Meeting in fall of 1993.  Monthly pull back meetings               
              will be held during the 1992-1993 school year to provide                       
              opportunities for the research dyads to share the progress of their            
              projects with each other and with the principal investigators.//
