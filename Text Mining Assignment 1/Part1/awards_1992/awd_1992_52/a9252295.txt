Abstract    :
              This project will assist in the development of an aquatic                      
              ecology center at Arkansas Tech University that is designed to                 
              demonstrate ecological principles and promote interdisciplinary                
              research by undergraduate students.  The center is well                        
              equipped for sampling living organisms, but these biotic                       
              communities can be greatly influenced by transient abiotic                     
              factors that vary regularly (e.g., daily or seasonally) or are                 
              unpredictable (e.g., occur during storm events or accidental                   
              pollutant discharge).   Equipping the aquatic ecology center                   
              with two sequential water samplers; two meters for continuous                  
              chemical records; two water level recorders; and accessories to                
              electronically transfer data will permit students to                           
              investigate both short-term and long-term environmental                        
              changes.  Multiple meter sets will allow hypothesis testing                    
              among stream sites and among lake depths.  This center will                    
              provide invaluable experience to upper division undergraduates                 
              in several science majors regardless of whether they enter                     
              their careers directly or pursue graduate degrees.  The                        
              equipment will also be of use in a summer conservation course                  
              for high school science teachers, and in the Gifted and                        
              Talented program for outstanding high school students.
