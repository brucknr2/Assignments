Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Human biology is the basis for a tenth grade, activity-based                   
              biology course.  The major goals of the course are to                          
              understand those characteristics which are unique to the                       
              human species and which are shared with other living                           
              systems, to understand the place of humans in the biosphere                    
              and the consequences of our interactions with the                              
              environment, and to understand the place of humans in                          
              evolution and the consequences of our interactions with                        
              other species and the environment on the evolutionary                          
              process.  The course is informed by science reform movements                   
              and stresses understanding concepts and processes over                         
              vocabulary.  The content will emphasize major biological                       
              themes as identified in curriculum frameworks:  evolution,                     
              genetic continuity, patterns of organizations,                                 
              bioenergetics, regulation, behavior, development, forms and                    
              function, biodiversity, and ecology.  The course, designed                     
              for all students and schools, is organized about topics                        
              which concern students:  the human species, the human                          
              organism, human physical performance, human life cycle,                        
              human population, and human adaption.  It incorporates                         
              laboratory activities, and instructional technologies and                      
              employs modified learning cycle and modern assessment                          
              strategies.  Materials include a student textbook, a student                   
              resource book, teacher's guide, an assessment package and an                   
              implementation guide.
