Abstract    :
              Westmoreland County Community College's introductory physics                   
              and chemistry labs and the electronics engineering technology                  
              program are being enhanced by interfacing computers with                       
              existing laboratory equipment to provide new and expanded                      
              experimentation opportunities for the students. Students are                   
              involved in computer-controlled experimentation in chemistry                   
              and physics laboratory classes; industry or university-level                   
              lab experiences in chemistry, physics, and electronics                         
              engineering technology; hands-on experiences in transducer                     
              design and construction for electronics engineering majors; and                
              chemistry laboratory experiences involving gas chromatography.
