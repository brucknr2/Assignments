Abstract    :
                   The Joint Policy Board for Mathematics, representing the                  
              American Mathematical Society, the Mathematical Association of                 
              America, and the Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics is             
              conducting a study of the recognition and rewards system in the                
              mathematical sciences.  Numerous recent reports point to this                  
              system as a key to reforming the K through 12 education system, to             
              revitalizing undergraduate science and mathematics education, and              
              to elevating the level of technology transfer in order to boost                
              economic competitiveness.  The study also responds to the                      
              increasing awareness of the importance of interdisciplinary work               
              and of the participation of mathematical scientists in the                     
              education of individuals who plan to work in industry and                      
              government.  This initial study will focus on the barriers to                  
              changing the rewards structure and will be implemented as a series             
              of case studies.  The results of this research will be reported to             
              NSF and to the mathematics community through the news publications             
              of the three organizations that comprise the JPBM.  This research              
              is expected to be the basis of further study of the system that                
              will lead to a set of recommendations and plan of action to produce            
              a recognition and rewards system that is consistent with the                   
              missions of institutions of higher education and with the diverse              
              responsibilities of college and university faculty.//
