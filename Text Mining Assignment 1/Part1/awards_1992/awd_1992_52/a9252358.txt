Abstract    :
              The Department of Chemistry is developing a series of                          
              experiments which are being incorporated into an instrumental                  
              analysis laboratory manual which emphasizes bioanalytical                      
              determinations, includes standard laboratory practices, and                    
              incorporates an ordering of experiments that is related to                     
              actual steps in problem-solving.  The project centers around                   
              improving the instruction which is involved in instrumental and                
              physical measurements courses which are usually offered in the                 
              third or fourth year of study.  The problems common to such                    
              courses which this project is working to overcome include                      
              insufficient emphasis on bioanalytical experiments, an order of                
              topics covered that is based on the complexity of a technique                  
              rather than the steps followed in problem-solving, and pedagogy                
              that is overly biased toward illustration of a measurement                     
              concept at the expense of standard laboratory practices.
