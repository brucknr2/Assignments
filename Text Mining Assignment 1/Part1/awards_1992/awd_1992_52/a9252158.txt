Abstract    :
              The aim of the project is to equip teaching laboratories with                  
              video-imaging and recording systems for use in large-enrollment                
              Introductory Biology courses and an upper-division Parasitology                
              course.  This system will allow students to make class                         
              presentations by projecting microscopic specimens (prepared                    
              slide and wet mount) as well as larger scale experimental set                  
              ups and dissections.  Use of this video instrumentation is                     
              intended to:  (1) increase the participation of visually and/or                
              motor impaired students by allowing them to be mainstreamed                    
              rather than be segregated from their classmates; (2) enhance                   
              class presentations by students in cooperative learning groups;                
              (3) extend the instructional capability of student microscopes,                
              and (4) produce videotapes and videoexams.  The goal is to                     
              embrace diversity in the classroom by helping disabled students                
              overcome the physical barriers to hands-on learning in the lab                 
              and by appealing to the variety of students' learning styles                   
              including those who rely mainly on visual stimulation for                      
              information processing.  The implementation of cooperative                     
              learning methods is expected to enhance student learning by                    
              requiring students to take responsibility not only for their                   
              own learning, but for their group members' learning as well.
