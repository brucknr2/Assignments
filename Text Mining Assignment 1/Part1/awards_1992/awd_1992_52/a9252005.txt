Abstract    :
              This project incorporates metals processing equipmentinto a                    
              materials processing laboratory to improve the education of                    
              technicians for industry and laboratories.  Recognizing that                   
              research and development in the field of materials has been                    
              advancing rapidly with ever increasing applications of new                     
              manufacturing processes to make better products for society,                   
              Hocking Technical College of Nelsonville, Ohio, instituted in                  
              1989 an Associate of Applied Science program in Materials                      
              Engineering Technology, and manufacturing courses in the                       
              Drafting & Design Technology area were modified to include more                
              materials education.  This project were further enhance these                  
              programs.  The metal processing equipment requested includes:                  
              a furnace with atmosphere capability suitable for heat treating                
              many kinds of metals, and a non-ferrous metal melter.  These                   
              two items enhance the education of technicians by providing                    
              hands-on experience with a variety of heat treating methods and                
              the ability to melt metals such as aluminum and brass.  In this                
              way, structures caused by processing of metals can be more                     
              effectively related to resulting properties.
