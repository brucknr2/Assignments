Abstract    :
              The objective of this project is to give our students                          
              experience with state-of-the-art computer equipment and to                     
              increase their familiarity with quantitative physics.  To                      
              address these issues, we have equipped our physics laboratory                  
              with 12 computer-interfaced data acquisition stations to be                    
              used with traditional laboratory equipment for measurements of                 
              heat, light, sound, electricity, magnetism and motion.  These                  
              data acquisition systems, supported by the appropriate                         
              software, are capable of data storage, analysis, manipulation                  
              and retrieval and are therefore more advanced than the                         
              traditional methods used to perform analysis of physics data.                  
              Also, the simulation capabilities of the computer are being                    
              exploited for visualization of equations as well as the                        
              modeling of physical systems.  Mastery of this equipment                       
              provides the students with backgrounds for understanding the                   
              operation principles of other types of equipment using the                     
              sensor/transducer/amplifier/recorder component series.  The                    
              simulation experience helps students bridge the conceptual gap                 
              between theory and experiment and it is hoped that this process                
              will lead the student to an increase in critical thinking                      
              regarding phenomena in the physical world.
