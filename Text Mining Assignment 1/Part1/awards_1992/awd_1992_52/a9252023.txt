Abstract    :
              This project is the development of a laboratory course in                      
              undergraduate polymer chemistry.  This is part of an overall                   
              plan to develop a chemistry degree with a polymer option, an                   
              objective consistent with goals to increase polymer education                  
              in the undergraduate curriculum.  An infrared spectrophotometer                
              is used by the students to identify common polymers by                         
              interpretation of infrared spectra.  Students gain experience                  
              in the determination of physical properties of polymers using                  
              differential scanning calorimetry and the thermo-mechanical                    
              analyzer.  Specific properties measured are melting points,                    
              glass transition temperatures, decomposition temperatures, and                 
              coefficients of thermal expansion.  An automatic recording                     
              membrane osmometer is used to provide instruction in the                       
              determination of molecular weights.  A film-fiber accessory for                
              an thermo-mechanical analyzer is used to measure tensile                       
              properties and the change in these properties with temperature.
