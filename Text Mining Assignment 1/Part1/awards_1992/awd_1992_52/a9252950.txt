Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This Wisconsin Genetics Education Program has been                             
              responsible for the development of genetics activities which                   
              have been developed by classroom teachers, K-12.  These                        
              activities have taken place over the past six years and                        
              consequently many activities will be generated and/or                          
              revised to make them suitable for the appropriate grade                        
              level.  These materials will be integrated into existing                       
              science texts.  The materials address genetics in several                      
              contexts.  Some integrate content with arts or language                        
              curricula; many address issues of genetics in social and                       
              personal contexts.  They are suited for all levels of                          
              students and all ability levels, K-12.  In addition to the                     
              development of genetics modules, workshops illustrating                        
              project use will be held at national professional                              
              conferences in order to share these and other activities                       
              with pre-college teachers.
