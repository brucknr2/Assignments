Abstract    :
              Engineering majors at the Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute are                 
              designing, implementing, and debugging the hardware and                        
              software for embedded control systems using a multimedia                       
              interactive learning system laboratory.  Students learn the                    
              fundamentals of embedded control systems while building                        
              portions of target systems in eight laboratory projects.                       
              Multimedia interactive tutorials facilitate learning the                       
              fundamental principles and laboratory techniques required to                   
              carry out the projects.  These tutorials use text, graphics,                   
              still color images, full motion video, audio, and animation to                 
              present information.  Hardware and software, available as part                 
              of the laboratory bench-station equipment, is used to implement                
              and debug the embedded control of the target system.                           
              Multimedia Tutorial Systems at each station hold the knowledge                 
              bases, hardware, and software required for interactive                         
              learning.  Two Digital Video Development Systems provide video-                
              data compression in the multimedia system resulting in higher                  
              quality video and faster access time.  This laboratory approach                
              allows teaching embedded control to all engineering students                   
              independently of discipline.  It uses a multimedia interactive                 
              learning methodology which can be easily adapted at other                      
              institutions to complement traditional learning modes.
