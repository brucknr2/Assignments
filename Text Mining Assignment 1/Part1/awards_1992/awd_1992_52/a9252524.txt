Abstract    :
              A video on using supercalculators as one approach to curriculum                
              reform is being designed, developed, tested, and evaluated.                    
              The video will illustrate the changes that take place in                       
              mathematics classrooms when personal supercalculators are used                 
              regularly for instruction, homework, and tests.  Live classroom                
              instructional scenes, separated by brief interview statements                  
              by national curriculum reform leaders, will be featured.  The                  
              completed video will be mailed, free-of-charge, to each of the                 
              nation's 2,5000 mathematics during August 1992.
