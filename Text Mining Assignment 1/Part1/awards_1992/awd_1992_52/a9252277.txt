Abstract    :
              There is general agreement that exploration of the physical                    
              world can be more effectively taught utilizing modern computer                 
              technologies. The ability of the computer to quickly acquire                   
              and analyze data will allow more time for the student to focus                 
              on the concepts being taught.  This project utilizes computer                  
              data acquisition, analysis, and scientific report writing to                   
              better teach concepts in the physics laboratory through                        
              cooperative and discovery modes of learning.The major                          
              instruments needed to accomplish the above aim are 14 computer                 
              stations with the necessary hardware and software to perform                   
              the functions of data acquisition, analysis and scientific                     
              report writing.A major goal of this project is to reach out to                 
              women and Native American students and make physics concepts                   
              more accessible to them by using cooperative and discovery                     
              modes of learning.There is a national effort in physics                        
              teaching to teach fundamental concepts using computers.                        
              Avoiding the emphasis on repetitious data acquisition will make                
              the field more applicable to the student's needs and therefore                 
              more exciting.  There is the general realization that since the                
              computer has become an indispensable tool for the practicing                   
              scientist, it must also be integrated into the teaching of                     
              physics.
