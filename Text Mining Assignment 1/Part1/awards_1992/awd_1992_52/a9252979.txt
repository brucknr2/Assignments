Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Three successful marine science curricula and teacher                          
              training packages, For Sea, Mare, and Living in Water,                         
              developed by the Marine Science Center, the Lawrence Hall of                   
              Science, and the National Aquarium in Baltimore, will be                       
              refined and enhanced in preparation for the production of                      
              two, multimedia compact discs (CD ROM).  Advances in CD ROM                    
              technology coupled with increasing accessibility to the                        
              technology, make the compact disc an effective tool for                        
              curriculum development, utilization, and distribution.  The                    
              compact disc will contain all text and graphic images from                     
              the three curricular projects; and, a comprehensive indexing                   
              system allowing materials to be utilized in a variety of                       
              manners, including thematically and topically, to effect                       
              curriculum integration.  Training will be provided to an                       
              existing cadre of teacher trainers to maximize the                             
              implementation of the new curriculum and CD ROM disc.
