Abstract    :
              The project is designed to expose undergraduate biology                        
              students to investigative research throughout their college                    
              education.  All of the biology labs are being revised to                       
              include investigative components.  In addition, in their junior                
              year, biology majors take a research techniques course.  Some                  
              majors then undertake an independent research project.  The                    
              labs and the research projects encourage students to be active                 
              participants in scientific investigation, rather than being                    
              passive observers.  To conduct investigative laboratories and                  
              to support student research projects in structural biology, the                
              project requires a research quality compound microscope and                    
              dissecting microscope equipped with an interchangeable                         
              automatic camera system and color videocamera and monitor.  The                
              compound microscope will have the capability of brightfield,                   
              phase contrast, and Nomarski optics, as well as low UV and                     
              visible light epifluorescence.
