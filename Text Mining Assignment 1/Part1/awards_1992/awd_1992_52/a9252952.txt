Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This project will develop a set of curriculum materials and                    
              accompanying teacher support materials that will use                           
              geometry to bring a culture of mathematical exploration into                   
              the classroom, interconnect students' experiences with                         
              various parts of experience.  The materials will include (1)                   
              a library of students activities designed so they can be                       
              used to form coherent units addressing specific content and                    
              themes; (2) a Curriculum Map Maker designed to help teachers                   
              select activities and sequences of related activities,                         
              ranging from extensions to existing geometry courses to                        
              completely new courses; and (3) a Self-Guided Inservice                        
              Package  to help teachers learn to make effective use of the                   
              toolkit and to explore the new models of teaching embodied                     
              in the activities.                                                             
                                                                                             
              The activities will encourage students to experiment                           
              mentally, using physical manipulatives, and using computer                     
              images.  They will foster students' development of                             
              mathematical ways of reasoning, analyzing, and                                 
              communicating; link geometry to science, technology, art.                      
              and other areas of students' experience; and link geometry                     
              to important ideas in other areas of mathematics, including                    
              algebra, analysis, number theory, combinatoriecs, and linear                   
              algebra.
