Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Constructing Science:  Materials and Activities for                            
              kindergarten and First grade will use a collaboration of                       
              classroom teachers, science educators, university psychology                   
              and education researchers, and university scientists to                        
              develop, implement, evaluate and disseminate on a national                     
              basis model sets of instructional methods and materials for                    
              the active engagement of kindergarten and first-grade                          
              children in science learning and exploration.  This process                    
              for curriculum development has been successfully piloted                       
              through a colloquium series initiated by the Citizens'                         
              Committee for Public Education in Philadelphia and                             
              facilitated by directors of PENNlincs with funding from                        
              PATHS/PRISM, ARCO and the Institute for Research in                            
              Cognitive Science, U of P.  The proposed program will                          
              improve the quality of science education and at the same                       
              time ensure that more time is spent on science education in                    
              kindergarten.  This project will bring developmentally                         
              appropriate science content and science processes to primary                   
              grade children in such a way (a)  that scientists, educators                   
              and parents will be assured that children are truly learning                   
              important science concepts and processes, (b) that the                         
              methods have applicability to the realities of classrooms,                     
              and (c)  that children's initial school experiences in                         
              science are rich and that children gain positive attitudes,                    
              motivation and vocabulary that will serve as a strong                          
              foundation for more formal science study.  The methods will                    
              enhance any science curriculum available or under                              
              development.
