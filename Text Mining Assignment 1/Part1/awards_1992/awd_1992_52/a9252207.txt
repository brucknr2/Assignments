Abstract    :
              An Optics and Photonics Laboratory is being developed to be                    
              used in two physics department courses, a new course,                          
              Principles of Optics and Photonics, and an existing course,                    
              Lasers and Applications, which is being upgraded to include a                  
              laboratory section.  The course Principles of Optics and                       
              Photonics is a prerequisite for electrical engineering courses                 
              in photonics and fiber optics and for a physics course in                      
              Lasers and Applications.  The equipment consists of the                        
              apparatus necessary to demonstrate a broad range of optical                    
              principles and to introduce students to the important                          
              fundamental properties of sources and detectors used in modern                 
              photonics technology.  The major equipment includes:  Projects                 
              in Optics Kits; Laser Picowatt Digital Power Meters; Germanium                 
              Infrared Detectors; Spatial Filters; and Multispec                             
              Monochromator/Spectrographs and Accessories.
