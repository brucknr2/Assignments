Abstract    :
              The acquisition of a scanning electron microscope(SEM) will                    
              permit the department to:  (1) develop a new course on the                     
              theory and practice of scanning electron microscopy, (2) to                    
              support and facilitate interactive student-faculty research,                   
              and (3) to enrich and extend laboratory opportunities for                      
              students and faculty in Cell Biology, Advanced Cell Physiology,                
              Developmental Biology, and Micropaleontology.  The SEM will be                 
              central to a number of independent study projects that range                   
              from changes in leukemia cell membrane morphology to the                       
              microanatomy of spider web "silk".  This project will augment                  
              an ongoing program with a philosophy of providing curricular                   
              and research opportunities that stimulate professionalism,                     
              encourage minority education, and maintain the interests of                    
              students considering graduate study and careers in science.
