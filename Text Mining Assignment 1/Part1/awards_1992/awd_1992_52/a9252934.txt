Abstract    :
                   The Board on International Comparative Studies in Education               
              contributes to a better understanding of national education policy             
              issues by working to ensure that data from comparative studies in              
              education are available and are of adequate quality for policy                 
              purposes and curriculum design.  The board was established by the              
              National Academy of Sciences (NAS)--National Research Council (NRC)            
              in 1988 at the request of the National Center for Education                    
              Statistics (NCES) and the National Science Foundation (NSF).                   
                   The purposes of the board are to (1) improve the scope,                   
              quality, and utilization of comparative education data in the                  
              United States; (2) serve as a forum for informed deliberation about            
              the range of international education studies in which the United               
              States participates; (3) promote institutional mechanisms and                  
              commitments to encourage cooperation in worthwhile studies by other            
              nations; and (4) enhance infrastructure and research methodology,              
              both nationally and globally.  While board activity relevant to all            
              of these responsibilities serves the policymakers and the education            
              research community in the United States, the board's influence                 
              extends internationally through its activities related to the                  
              latter two purposes.                                                           
                   Also included in this grant is funding for several                        
              international comparative studies, the largest amongst them is the             
              Third International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS).
