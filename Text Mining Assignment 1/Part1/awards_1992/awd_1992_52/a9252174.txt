Abstract    :
              The Division of Mathematics is initiating a mathematics                        
              laboratory for use by students taking algebra and calculus                     
              courses.  This project permits the mathematics faculty to                      
              incorporate new and existing computer software into the                        
              curriculum of college algebra, trigonometry, calculus I, II,                   
              and III.  The project provides 15 microcomputers, six printers,                
              and Derive software for use by mathematics faculty in addition                 
              to software provided by textbook publishers.  Derive                           
              intelligently applies the rules of algebra, trigonometry,                      
              calculus, and matrix algebra to solve a wide range of                          
              mathematical problems.  Powerful capabilities exist for both                   
              two-dimensional (Cartesian, polar, and parametric) and three-                  
              dimensional graphing.
