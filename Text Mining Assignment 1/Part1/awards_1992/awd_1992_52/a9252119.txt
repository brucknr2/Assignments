Abstract    :
              This project capitalizes on recent developments in computer                    
              technology, authoring programs, optical disc technology, and                   
              multimedia to create a unique instructional environment within                 
              an anatomy and physiology laboratory for health science majors                 
              (nurses, therapists, laboratory technicians).  Video exercises                 
              for the wet lab dissections and experiments and interactive                    
              multimedia stations (a combination of text, pictures, diagrams,                
              animation, sounds, and linear video) develop and reinforce                     
              students' intuition and understanding of anatomic and                          
              physiologic principles.  Equipment includes 30 TV/VCR/Headphone                
              stations for the video-guided dissections and six multimedia                   
              workstations, each consisting of a Macintosh IIci and a Pioneer                
              LD4200 Laserdisc player.  The multimedia stations are networked                
              to and managed by a faculty development/file server workstation                
              consisting of a Macintosh IIci, Pioneer LD 4200 Laserdisc                      
              player, and an appropriate authoring program.  Simulations and                 
              animations enhance the wet lab format with an emphasis on                      
              interaction.
