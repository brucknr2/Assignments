Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Heritage College and Seattle University jointly conduct a four-week            
              summer commuter/residential mathematics and physics camp for                   
              ethnic/racial minority girls entering the eighth grade, with follow-up         
              activities throughout the subsequent academic year.  The targeted              
              populations are Native American and Hispanic girls from the                    
              agricultural Toppenish area, and African-American girls from the urban         
              neighborhoods near Seattle University. The program, which involves             
              50 participants each summer in the summers of 1992-1994, serves                
              students who are able and well-motivated but who might well lose               
              interest in science and mathematics without special attention.                 
              Activities include:  1) small group daily interactive activities and           
              experiments at each campus site on topics such as fluid flows, waves,          
              and water quantity and quality, supplemented by field trips and guest          
              scientists, primarily women; and 2) field experiments at a residential         
              lakeside science camp.
