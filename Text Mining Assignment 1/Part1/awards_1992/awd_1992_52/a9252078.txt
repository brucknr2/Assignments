Abstract    :
              Students in the Systems Engineering Laboratory of the North                    
              Carolina A & T State University are learning human-machine                     
              interaction principles, as part of their industrial engineering                
              education, using a teleoperated robot.  Working in a human-                    
              machine interaction environment is a newly accepted paradigm,                  
              shifting from manual-supervisory to cognitive-supervisory tasks                
              involving the complexity of the human-machine interface.  This                 
              laboratory allows the incorporation of modern technologies                     
              associated with human-machine systems in a modern industrial                   
              engineering curriculum.  Among those, the laboratory (1)                       
              exposes the graduate and undergraduate students to a human-                    
              machine environment that supports modern engineering design                    
              theories, (2) provides the students with an environment to                     
              experiment with multi-agent systems (robots, computers,                        
              cameras, human operators, etc.), and (3) improves quality of                   
              instruction in a cost/effective manner by providing resources                  
              for student projects and direct laboratory case studies.
