Abstract    :
              This collaborative project is being implemented at the                         
              University of Iowa, University of Wisconsin-La Crosse, and                     
              Brigham Young University.  Renewed calculus materials developed                
              through the NSF supported project at the University of Iowa                    
              will be revised, tested, and refined at these three                            
              institutions.  The University of Iowa and the University of                    
              Wisconsin- La Crosse are planning toward full implementation.                  
              The project involves extensive training of faculty and teaching                
              assistants to use these materials and approaches.  In addition                 
              to learning traditional calculus skills, students are exposed                  
              to new ideas through large open ended projects on a variety of                 
              scientific and mathematical projects.
