Abstract    :
              The Science Department of Iowa Lakes Community College is                      
              upgrading and revising curricula of introductory physical and                  
              biological science courses and of the inorganic and organic                    
              chemistry courses through purchase of computer hardware,                       
              software and computer-supported instrumentation.  Student                      
              learning and lab efficiency are increased by utilization of                    
              computers within the lab setting to simulate costly equipment                  
              and through use of computer-supported instrumentation to                       
              provide hands-on experience.  Faculty are revising the lab                     
              experiments to include these new technologies.
