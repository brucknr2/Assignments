Abstract    :
              In 1988 the Department of Physics & Astronomy of Drake                         
              University embarked on a major revision of its undergraduate                   
              curriculum for majors.  The introductory two years have by now                 
              been completely reformed to stress computer usage and                          
              investigations, both in the lectures and in the laboratories.                  
              This project is extending the computer intensive curriculum                    
              into upper-division courses.  The department is inheriting                     
              additional laboratory space in its current building to be                      
              vacated by the department of chemistry.  The project has                       
              acquired six Macintosh IIci computers with Mathematica                         
              software, as well as six Tennelec PCA Multiport-E multichannel                 
              analyzer boards with IEEE-488 interfaces.  The Macintosh                       
              computers are located in a computation laboratory which also                   
              serves as a classroom for physics instruction.  The use of                     
              Mathematica is being introduced into several upper-division                    
              classes.  The microcomputers are also being used in an                         
              astrophysics laboratory based on image processing, and in                      
              undergraduate research participation.  They are being used in                  
              a nearby nuclear radiation laboratory for lab courses during                   
              approximately one-half of one semester per year.  There,                       
              coupled by cable to the Tennelec interfaces, they are                          
              functioning as multichannel analyzers.
