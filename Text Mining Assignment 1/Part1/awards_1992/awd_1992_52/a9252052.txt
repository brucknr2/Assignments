Abstract    :
              The present project is designed to improve undergraduate                       
              psychology students' research skills by introducing                            
              microcomputer research skills in the psychology curriculum.                    
              The specific goal is to teach undergraduate students how to                    
              employ microcomputers to increase their understanding of human                 
              mental behavior and psychological research.  The major                         
              instruments to achieve this goal are ten Macintosh                             
              microcomputers and the software necessary to examine and                       
              understand the complexities of human mental behavior.  Students                
              are taught how to use microcomputers to answer research                        
              questions, specifically for the experimental study of human                    
              learning and memory.  This project integrates the psychology                   
              curriculum, enabling students to link the statistical analysis                 
              of large data bases, stimulus presentation and experimental                    
              design into the existing academic framework.
