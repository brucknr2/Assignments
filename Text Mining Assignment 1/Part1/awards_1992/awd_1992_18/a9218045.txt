Abstract    :
              The development of coastal areas is                                            
              a source of economic growth but                                                
              also the cause of human and                                                    
              economic losses due to storm surges                                            
              and hurricanes.  The possibility of                                            
              sea level rise increases the                                                   
              vulnerability of these zones, and                                              
              governments and private agents

              develop a framework and methodology                                            
              for determining the value of                                                   
              improved sea level and regional

              coastal areas, and illustrate the                                              
              methodology considering a set of                                               
              alternative data collection and
