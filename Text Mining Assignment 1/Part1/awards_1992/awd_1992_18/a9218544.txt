Abstract    :
              9218544  Parish  This project is a one-year continuation of a successful 
              investigation into the antarctic surface and boundary layer wind  field, with
              specific emphasis on the extremely strong down-slope  katabatic winds in the
              vicinity of Terra Nova Bay.  The outward  flowing surface air is an integral
              part of the meridional  circulation, together with inflow and convergence
              aloft, and  generally sinking motion over the continent.    The pattern of
              katabatic winds over the sloping ice sheet is highly  irregular, with air
              converging into several narrow coastal regions  to produce locally what are
              recognized as the strongest and most  persistent surface winds in the world. 
              Known examples are at Cape  Denison and Port Martin in Adelie Land (facing
              Australia), and in  Terra Nova Bay on the western coast of the Ross Sea.    
              Specific tasks to be undertaken as part of this project are to  complete the
              kinematic, dynamic, and climatological analysis of  specific katabatic events. 
              Automatic weather station observations  from the vicinity of Terra Nova Bay,
              satellite imagery collected at  McMurdo Station, and synoptic weather analyses
              from the Australian  Bureau of Meteorology will be examined for the period of
              1988 to  1991 to determine the broadscale conditions associated with 
              variations in the katabatic wind regime at Terra Nova Bay.  ***
