Abstract    :
              At the end of their active lives, most stars become large, very                
              cool but bright red giants.  As they finish this stage, many begin             
              to lose their outer layers through outflows known as winds.  It is             
              thought that an important factor driving these winds is the                    
              formation of small solid particles commonly referred to as dust.               
              The role played by this dust in driving the outflow and the                    
              dynamics of such outflows will be investigated.  An investigation              
              will also be conducted of the effects on the wind of the presence              
              of a binary companion to the star in question.  Submillimeter                  
              observations will be undertaken to verify some of the predictions              
              of the theory.  Since the strong winds from red giants completely              
              alter the evolution of the stars and provide enriched material to              
              the interstellar medium, this work has broad ramifications to                  
              several areas of astronomy.
