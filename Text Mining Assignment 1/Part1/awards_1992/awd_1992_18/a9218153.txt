Abstract    :
              Footprinting is a valuable technique that provides sequence-                   
              specific details about protein-DNA interactions.  The aim of this              
              small grant for exploratory research is to develop methods to                  
              footprint DNA in vivo using bacteriophages Mu and D108. If                     
              successful, this effort will provide a method to obtain dynamic                
              structural information in almost any gene in many different species            
              of bacteria.

              A central problem in molecular biology is to understand how genes              
              are organized in living cells.
