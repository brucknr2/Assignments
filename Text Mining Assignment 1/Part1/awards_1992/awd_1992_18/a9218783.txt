Abstract    :
              Although polyhalogenated aromatic compounds are major                          
              environmental pollutants, little is known about the enzymes                    
              involved in the biodegradation or detoxification of these                      
              compounds.  We propose to use the degradation of                               
              2,4,5-trichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4,5-T) by Pseudomonas                     
              cepacia AC1100 as a model for the biodegradation of                            
              polyhalogenated aromatic compounds.  We propose to identify,                   
              purify, and characterize enzymes involved in 2,4,5-T degradation.              
              After one of the enzymes is purified, a partial amino acid                     
              sequence will be determined.  Finally, the structural gene for                 
              the protein will be cloned using DNA probes constructed with                   
              amino acid sequence data about the enzyme, and characterized.                  
              The results from our work and additional genetic information                   
              about 2,4,5-T degradation from Chakrabarty's group will together               
              form an important contribution to our understanding about                      
              microbial degradation of polyhalogenated aromatic compounds.                   
              %%%                                                                            
              Polyhalogenated aromatic compounds are major environmental                     
              pollutants; however, little is known about the biochemistry of                 
              microbial degradation of such compounds.  In order to use                      
              biological approaches to remove these compounds from our                       
              environment, it is necessary to understand the biochemistry of                 
              microbial degradation of these compounds.  We proposed to use the              
              degradation of 2,4,5-trichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4,5-T) by                  
              Pseudomonas cepacia as a model system to study the biochemistry                
              of microbial degradation of polyhalogenated aromatic compounds.                
              We will identify and isolate enzymes involved in 2,4,5-T                       
              degradation and clone the corresponding genes encoding the                     
              enzymes.  The results from this work will provide fundamental                  
              information on microbial degradation of polyhalogenated aromatic               
              compounds.
