Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This project continues observations of an unexpectedly "strong"                
              1992 El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) event on corals and coral             
              reef ecosystems of the eastern Pacific Ocean.  Dr. Glynn is                    
              presently completing a 10 year monitoring program on the recovery              
              processes of coral reef ecosystems from previous ENSO events, which            
              were classified as "very strong" and "weak".  It now appears as                
              this project is approaching completion, that a "strong" ENSO event             
              is in full swing and that the warming of surface waters is being               
              felt by several coral reef ecosystems in the eastern Pacific                   
              region.  Based on biological samples (corals) collected early this             
              year from sites off Panama, Costa Rica and the Galapagos Islands,              
              it appears that corals are once again experiencing loss of pigments            
              and zooxanthellae, termed "coral bleaching".  The project will                 
              obtain real-time responses of coral reef organisms to a "strong" El            
              Nino disturbance, which will be useful for comparison with past                
              "very strong" and "weak" warming events in the eastern Pacific                 
              Ocean.
