Abstract    :
                   Stalked crinoids (Isocrinida) represent a major                           
              component of living assemblages and produce modern crinoid-                    
              rich sediments along the western flank of the Little Bahama                    
              Bank.  Three aspects of stalked crinoid biology will be                        
              examined as they contributed to understanding                                  
              paleoecological processes:  1) Rates of stalk growth and                       
              sediment production; 2) Distributional controls:  what are                     
              the relationships between current flow, temperature, the                       
              distribution of living crinoid assemblages and the nature                      
              and amount of crinoidal contributions to sediments?  and  3)                   
              Taphonomy:  what are the temporal and spatial variations and                   
              taphonomic modifications of crinoid-rich sediments in the                      
              study area, and how can these be applied to the                                
              reconstruction of fossil assemblages?  Isocrinids have a                       
              fossil record dating to the Triassic and these modern                          
              assemblages represent an excellent analogue for better                         
              understanding paleoecological processes and interpreting                       
              ancient crinoidal deposits.
