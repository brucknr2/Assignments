Abstract    :
              This grant provides the funds to continue to make measurements of              
              airglow and aurora above South Pole Station, Antarctica.  There are            
              several instruments (Michelson interferometer, a scanning near-                
              infrared photometer, a four-channel photometer and an Ebert-Fastie             
              spectrophotometer) which produce infrared and visible spectral of              
              several atmospheric species (oxygen, nitrogen and the hydroxyl                 
              radical).  These measurements are used to deduce the mesospheric               
              winds and temperature, planetary wave activity and the energy of               
              the precipitating electrons which cause the aurora.                            
                                                                                             
              This research is being done by undergraduate institution.
