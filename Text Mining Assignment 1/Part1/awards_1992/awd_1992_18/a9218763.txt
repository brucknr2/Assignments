Abstract    :
              The enzyme adenylosuccinate synthetase obtained from E. coli is                
              dimeric and binds three substrates plus a metal ion.  The chemical             
              mechanism of the function of the synthetase is approached from a               
              number of points of view.  Specific amino acid residues involved in            
              binding and catalytic processes are examined via chemical and                  
              metagenesis approaches.  These studies require considerable                    
              spectroscopic effort to localize the observed effects.  Chemical               
              and spectroscopic exchange studies will be performed to get at                 
              central questions of the timing and order of binding and catalytic             
              steps.  Ongoing crystallograpic studies of wild type and mutant                
              enzyme as well as enzyme in the presence of inhibitors will be                 
              continued.                                                                     
              %%%                                                                            
              Adenylosuccinate synthetase is involved in the conversion of AMP               
              from IMP.  By virtue of its location at the beginning of a                     
              metabolic pathway, this enzyme is subject to a number of controls              
              of its catalytic activity as part of the overall metabolic                     
              integration of the cell.  The proposed research explores the                   
              complex interactions which exist between the enzyme and metabolites            
              and inhibitors it binds.  The proposed research will identify the              
              order and tightness of binding of effectors, substrates, and                   
              products, will identify catalytically important structures in the              
              enzyme, and will identify and characterize intermediates occurring             
              along the reaction pathway.  Studies of the three-dimensional                  
              structure of the enzyme, using X-ray crystallography, will be                  
              continued.
