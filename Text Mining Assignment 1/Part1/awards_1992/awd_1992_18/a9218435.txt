Abstract    :
              Volcanism and extensional tectonism spread across a broad                      
              region of the western U.S. during the Cenozoic.  Studies in                    
              recent years have provided much insight into the                               
              relationship between the tectonism and magmatism in the                        
              western U.S., but unsolved questions relating to the driving                   
              forces for extension remain.  The Cenozoic volcanic rocks of                   
              the High Plains provide a unique perspective on such                           
              problems.  These volcanic rocks are broadly similar in                         
              composition and closely contemporaneous with volcanic fields                   
              in the Rio Grande Rift and southwestward into Arizona.                         
              However, the High Plains volcanic fields lie 100-200 km east                   
              of the Rio Grande Rift in an area well beyond the effects of                   
              crustal extension.  Spatial and temporal variations in                         
              composition of volcanic rocks shown from our preliminary                       
              study (e.g., isotopic changes) require significant                             
              differences in source composition and crust and mantle                         
              structure.  A detailed study of this volcanic field will                       
              enable comparison with fields within the region of extension                   
              and provide essential constraints for physical models                          
              explaining relationship between magmatism and extensional                      
              tectonism.
