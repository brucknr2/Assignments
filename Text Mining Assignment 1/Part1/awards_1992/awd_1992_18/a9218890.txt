Abstract    :
              The principal objective of this research project is to                         
              quantify the relationships among melt bulk composition,                        
              temperature, and structure by using micro-Raman spectroscopy                   
              with a high-temperature heating stage.  Laboratory                             
              experiments will be conducted on alkali and alkaline earth                     
              aluminosilicate melts at temperatures up to 1700oC.  Results                   
              of the experiments will enable identification of the                           
              predominant structural units in the melt as a function of                      
              bulk composition and temperature, derivation of quantitative                   
              estimates of equilibrium constants, and computation of                         
              thermodynamic and transport properties.  The results will be                   
              applied to the study of chemically complex natural magmatic                    
              liquids and will ultimately find application in elucidating                    
              the behavior of melts within and on the Earth's surface.
