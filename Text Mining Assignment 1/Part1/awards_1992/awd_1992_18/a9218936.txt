Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Turtles exhibit intermittent ventilatory patterns in which brief               
              periods of ventilation are interspersed with apneas of variable                
              duration.  Associated with this ventilatory pattern are cyclic                 
              changes in pulmonary and systemic blood flow.  Due to the anatomy              
              of the heart, these changes in blood flow may be associated with               
              both right-to-left (R-L; pulmonary bypass) and left-to-right (L-R;             
              pulmonary recirculation) intracardiac shunting.  These                         
              cardiovascular changes can influence pulmonary gas exchange,                   
              affecting both CO2 and O2 transport.  The functional significance              
              of intracardiac shunting has remained primarily speculative.  This             
              study will determine the physiological role of intracardiac                    
              shunting during intermittent ventilation in turtles.  Specifically             
              the study will determine; 1) the flow ratios between the pulmonary             
              and systemic circuits (i.e. R-L and L-R shunts) during ventilation             
              and apnea and 2) the effects of cholinergic and adrenergic blockade            
              on the direction and magnitude of intracardiac shunt and correlate             
              these effects with changes in ventilatory patterns, pulmonary gas              
              exchanged and blood gas transport.  Studies will be conducted in               
              the turtle, Pseudemys scripta, in vivo at 25oC.  All objectives                
              will be accomplished in chronically instrumented, freely diving,               
              spontaneously ventilating animals.  Continuous measurements of                 
              pulmonary and systemic blood flows, ventilation, gas exchange, lung            
              gases and blood gases will be made.  The results will be analyzed              
              within the context of several current hypotheses addressing the                
              respiratory "benefits" of intracardiac shunting.  The hypotheses               
              presented are not necessarily novel, however, the experiments                  
              outlined in this proposal will for the first time specifically                 
              examine the functional significance of this distinctive type of                
              cardiovascular regulation.
