Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The proposed research is an investigation of the paleoclimatic                 
              significance and late-Quaternary history of sand dune fields and               
              lunettes (dunes fringing playa basins) on the Southern High Plains.            
              Three principal hypotheses will be tested:  1) the sand dune                   
              fields on the Southern High Plains formed synchronously between                
              9000 and 4500 yrs B.P., since 1000 yrs B.P., and historically; 2)              
              the lunettes of the Southern High Plains formed synchronously and              
              episodically during the late Quaternary and were derived from                  
              sediments in adjacent playas during droughts; 3) Holocene                      
              construction of the sand dunes and the lunettes occurred                       
              synchronously and was the result of regional drought.  There are               
              several significant aspects of the research.  The record of dune               
              construction and dune movement should provide a long-term (late                
              Quaternary) record of drought and wind erosion of the High Plains              
              surface.  Studying the historic record of dune activity along with             
              historic climate data will begin to provide some estimates of the              
              climatic thresholds that must be crossed before desertification                
              begins in the region.  Studying the lunettes is also important                 
              because they are the only sites of deposition on the Llano Estacado            
              with a demonstrated potential for a dateable paleoenvironmental                
              and stratigraphic record spanning the past 30,000+ years.  The                 
              proposed research on the Southern High Plains complements current              
              dune studies on the Northern High Plains (sponsored by NSF, USGS,              
              and NASA) and will contribute to a subcontinental-scale view of                
              late-Quaternary eolian erosion and sedimentation and attendant                 
              climatic implications.
