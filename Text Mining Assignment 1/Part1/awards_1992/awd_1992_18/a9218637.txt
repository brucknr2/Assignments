Abstract    :
              This award supports a paleobotanical study of existing samples                 
              from late Paleozoic and Mesozoic sedimentary rock formations in                
              the Central Transantarctic Mountains.  The project encompasses                 
              investigations of fossil forests, permineralized peat deposits,                
              compression/impression floras, and palynomorphs (pollen).  This                
              project is a portion of a continuing effort to elucidate the                   
              paleobiology and biostratigraphy of the late Paleozoic and early               
              Mesozoic of Antarctic.  This paleobotanical work forms the                     
              cornerstone of paleoenvironmental reconstructions for the time of              
              formation of the rocks and provides an important method of                     
              testing paleoclimatic models for the region.
