Abstract    :
                   This award provides one-half the funding required for the                 
              acquisition of high-resolution, shallow seismic reflection                     
              equipment to be operated by the Department of Geological Sciences              
              at the State University of New York in Binghamton. SUNY-Binghamton             
              is committed to providing the remaining funds needed.                          
                   The equipment will serve as a tool to provide images of  near-            
              surface geologic structures for research projects including the                
              investigation of 3-d site effects for seismic hazard estimation,               
              evaluation of the role of the seismographic station's "receiver                
              function" when modeling seismic waveforms for earthquake source                
              determinations or earth structure investigations, mapping of buried            
              faults, mapping traces of buried river deposits, and mapping  of               
              aquifers.
