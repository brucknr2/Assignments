Abstract    :
              This ongoing project is designed to cover the final phase of                   
              a collaborative study to determine the origin and evolution                    
              of the Laramie Anorthosite Complex by mapping, experimental                    
              petrology, and whole-rock and isotopic geochemistry of                         
              selected samples.  The study should increase understanding                     
              of  anorthosite petrogenesis and the origin of massive Fe-Ti                   
              oxide bodies, which are the major reserves of titanium in                      
              the U.S. and potentially important sources of iron.
