Abstract    :
              With this award, the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and                              
              Organometallic Chemistry Program provides support for a                        
              collaborative research project involving Drs. David B.                         
              Rorabacher and Ronald R. Schroeder of the Chemistry Department,                
              Wayne State University, and Dr. Leo A. Ochrymowycz of the                      
              Chemistry Department, University of Wisconsin-Eau Claire.  They                
              will synthesize a series of copper thiaether, thiaamine, and                   
              thiapyridine complexes in which both copper(I) and copper(II)                  
              oxidation states are accessible.  Using cyclic voltammetry,                    
              stopped-flow kinetics, NMR line broadening studies, and                        
              selected structural determinations, they will investigate the                  
              relationship between ligand geometric changes and transfer of                  
              electrons to and from the copper centers in these complexes.                   
              It is expected that under some conditions the rate of the                      
              reaction in one direction will be "gated" by the requirement                   
              for the intermediate to undergo a conformational change.                       
              %%%                                                                            
              Complexes of copper(I) and copper(II) are known to have                        
              different geometries, so that upon oxidation or reduction it is                
              likely that conformational changes will occur.  A                              
              conformational change creates an energy barrier to electron                    
              transfer.  If this energy barrier can be controlled, then it                   
              becomes possible for electron transfer to occur in one                         
              direction, that is, to be "gated."  This topic is of                           
              considerable current interest in biological chemistry, because                 
              it may be important in the reactions of metalloproteins.  This                 
              research will help to answer questions about the extent to                     
              which conformational changes in the proteins or around the                     
              metal binding site are involved in this effect.
