Abstract    :
              Modulating the level of protein biosynthetic machinery in response             
              to growth conditions is of utmost importance to every living cell.             
              In E. coli, two different regulatory systems couple the rate of                
              ribosomal RNA (rRNA) synthesis to growth rate.  However, the actual            
              mechanism(s) linking the central metabolism of the cell to the rate            
              of rRNA synthesis remain completely unknown.  The observation that             
              increased amounts of fructose 1,6 biphosphate (FbP) preferentially             
              inhibits in connecting central metabolism regulation of rRNA                   
              synthesis.  The development of a crude transcription-translation               
              system in which FbP specially inhibits rRNA synthesis provides an              
              experimental system for dissecting this effect.  Experiments to                
              determine whether RNA polymerase alone or additional factors in the            
              crude extract are needed for inhibition will determine the target              
              of FbP action.  Genetic analysis of this interaction will establish            
              the growth conditions under which the regulatory circuit involving             
              FbP is operative.

              This project offers a chance to understand a molecular circuit that            
              couples rRNA synthesis to carbon metabolism, a problem of central              
              importance to every living organism that has not been elucidated in            
              any experimental system.
