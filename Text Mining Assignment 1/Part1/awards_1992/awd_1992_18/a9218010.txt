Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This award supports an ongoing U.S.-Japan collaborative research               
              project between John Beavan and Chris Scholz of Lamont-Doherty                 
              Geological Observatory, Columbia University, and Teruyuki Kato,                
              Earthquake Research Institute, University of Tokyo.  This project              
              is part of a five-year collaboration to resolve several major                  
              problems related to the active tectonics of the Philippine Sea                 
              Plate and its boundaries through collection and analysis of                    
              Global Positioning System (GPS) measurements at sites                          
              strategically placed along the eastern, western, and northern                  
              boundaries of the Philippine Sea Plate in southeast Japan, the                 
              Ryukyus, Taiwan, and in the Bonins, Marianas, and Micronesia.                  
                                                                                             
              During the two-year period of the grant, the following specific                
              topics will be addressed:  (1) determination of accurate                       
              Philippine - Eurasian Plate and Philippine Sea-Pacific poles and               
              rotation rates; (2) the magnitude of plate driving forces at                   
              trench boundaries; (3) the mechanism of back-arc spreading; (4)                
              the mechanism of strike-slip in the forearc; (5) the mechanics of              
              arc-continent collision; and (6) the distribution of deformation               
              and seismic hazard in southeast Japan and Taiwan.  In addition to              
              the principal investigators, others involved in the project are                
              Dan Davis, SUNY Stony Brook; Steven Roecker, Rensselaer                        
              Polytechnic Institute; Kazuro Hirahara and T. Tanaka, Kyoto                    
              University; and I Murata, T. Kato, and S. Nakao, University of                 
              Tokyo.  This grant complements a grant from the NSF Earth                      
              Sciences Program, which is funding the research in the United                  
              States.
