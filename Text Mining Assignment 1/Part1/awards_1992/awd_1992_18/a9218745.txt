Abstract    :
              This research involves various experiments which lead to                       
              information concerning the dynamics of charge density wave (CDW)               
              and spin density wave (SDW) ground states.  The collective mode ac             
              response of CDW and SDW condensates will be investigated in the                
              radio, micro, millimeter and infrared spectral range, and will                 
              emcompass a search for nonlinear excitations of the ground states.             
              These experiments will lead to information on the interplay                    
              between collective mode and single particle excitations, including             
              questions concerning the dynamics of internal modes of the                     
              condensates.  Experiments will also be conducted under the joint               
              application of dc and ac fields, in an attempt at exploring the                
              possibility of quantum phenomena which may arise at low                        
              temperatures in the various broken symmetry ground states.  The                
              experiments will be conducted on various inorganic and organic                 
              linear chain compounds.

              This research involves the study of the behavior of various types              
              of new, ordered electron states of solids, called the charge                   
              density wave and spin density wave states.  The electrical                     
              conductivity will be investigated as the function of frequency and             
              of applied electric fields.  The objective is to examine the new               
              type of nonlinear transport phenomena which are due to the                     
              collective motion of these electron states.  Because of anomalous              
              response, these materials may also serve as novel detectors and                
              generators, and these aspects of the field will also be examined.              
              The experiments will be conducted in various organic and inorganic             
              materials where such states develop.
