Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase-oxygenase (RuBPCase) is the                  
              enzyme responsible for nearly all carbon fixation on this planet               
              and is the major carboxylating enzyme in the phytoplankton of the              
              world's oceans.  Additionally, RuBPCase may play a global role in              
              modulating one of the greenhouse gases, CO2.  Knowledge of the                 
              regulation of this enzyme is important for understanding control of            
              primary production in the oceans and phytoplankton response to                 
              environmental perturbations or long term change.  Dr. Tabita and               
              his collaborator, Dr. Paul, will focus on the molecular regulation             
              of this enzyme in picoplankton in coastal and oligotrophic oceanic             
              environments.  They have recently developed a method for extraction            
              of mRNA from phytoplankton and have detected RuBPCase gene                     
              expression in natural populations.  These biomolecular techniques              
              will be used to study diel and light-dependent regulation of the               
              RuBPCase gene in cultured Synechococcus spp. and prochlorophytes,              
              and in natural populations.  The second objective is to identify               
              and characterize the key primary producers by amplifying RUBPCase              
              mRNA for cloning and sequencing from natural populations.                      
              Amplification of mRNA will result in clones that originated from               
              transcriptionally active phototrophs.  Sequence data will be                   
              compared to RuBPCase data bases to identify the active species.  If            
              novel phototrophs are encountered, parsimony analysis will be                  
              performed to relate these forms to their evolutionary closest                  
              relative.  In summary, the project will provide fundamental                    
              information on the control of the RuBPCase genes in response to                
              environmental factors and identify key phototrophic organisms in               
              oceanic picoplankton.
