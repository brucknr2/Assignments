Abstract    :
              The study of variable stars is basic to much of astronomy.  The                
              properties of the variability provide more information than can be             
              obtained from static stars and they contribute greatly to our                  
              understanding of stellar structure and evolution, galactic                     
              evolution and cosmology.  This project concerns modelling of                   
              stellar instability and understanding its systematics.  A new                  
              nonlinear adaptive hydrodynamic code which produces better                     
              agreement between the models and the observations has been                     
              developed.  This new method resolves and tracks the important                  
              physical features during the pulsation cycle.  In this study, the              
              results from the new code will be combined with the PI's previously            
              developed semi-analytical theory of pulsation to gain insights into            
              the mechanisms.  The stars which will be considered range from the             
              regularly varying Cepheids and RR Lyrae stars to the erratic RV                
              Tauri stars and Semi-regular variables.  The effects of stochastic             
              noise on pulsations and methods of analysis of time-dependent                  
              signals will also be studied in the context of comparing the                   
              theoretical results with observation.
