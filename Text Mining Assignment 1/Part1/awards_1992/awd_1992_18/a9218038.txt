Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The project involves a program of observation and analysis of the              
              influence of local galaxy environments on the evolution of                     
              galaxies.  A large body of observational data obtained in the                  
              last several years will be used to investigate differences in the              
              fundamental properties of cluster and field galaxies such as the               
              mass and light distributions, and there will be an evaluation of               
              the effects such as the location within the cluster, the cluster               
              dynamical state, and morphological type.  An outgrowth of this                 
              work will be a calibration of the Tully-Fisher relation within                 
              clusters                                                                       
                                                                                             
              The Principal Investigator is an expert in research of this type.
