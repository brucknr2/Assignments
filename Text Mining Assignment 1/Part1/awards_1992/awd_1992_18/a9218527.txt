Abstract    :
              This four-year atmospheric chemistry project will extend a global              
              air sampling program to include a sampling site at South Pole                  
              Station.  Samples will be analyzed for the oxygen/nitrogen ratio               
              and for carbon dioxide content.  The work will be done                         
              cooperatively by the climatic baseline station operated by NOAA in             
              conjunction with the National Science Foundation.                              
                                                                                             
              Recent advances in instrumentation have made it possible to detect             
              variations in atmospheric oxygen content at the parts-per-million              
              level.  Such high precision atmospheric oxygen measurements are                
              important in the context of climate and global change since they               
              are not only important in their own right, but are basic to such               
              issues of global warming as the carbon dioxide budget, ozone, and              
              marine productivity.                                                           
                                                                                             
              Data from South Pole Station are necessary to constrain the                    
              estimates of carbon dioxide fluxes due to marine productivity in               
              the southern hemisphere, and to confirm indications that the oxygen            
              concentration in the southern hemisphere is generally higher than              
              that in the northern hemisphere.
