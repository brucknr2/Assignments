Abstract    :
              The P.I.s propose a multi-national project involving                           
              Australian, Brazilian and U.S. geoscientists in a pilot                        
              chemical and multi-isotopic study of 3 generations of mantle                   
              derived rocks from the Sao Francisco Craton of Brazil.                         
              Komatiites may be responsible for the very refractory nature                   
              of mantle beneath Archean terrains. Major mafic intrusions                     
              often involve the continental lithosphere in their evolution                   
              and, hence, give clues as to the composition and history of                    
              the lithosphere at the time of igneous intrusion.                              
              Lamproites and kimberlites represent small volume melts of                     
              incompatible element rich, possibly lithospheric, mantle.                      
              The project involves field-work and sample collecting in                       
              Brazil.  Petrographic and elemental analysis of the samples                    
              will be done by Dr. S. Esperanca of Deakin and Monash                          
              Universities in Melbourne, Australia.  Os and Nd isotopic                      
              analysis at DTM by Dr. Esperanca and the P.I. will then be                     
              used to constrain the age and chemical history of the melts                    
              and their implications for the present composition and                         
              formation history of the mantle.
