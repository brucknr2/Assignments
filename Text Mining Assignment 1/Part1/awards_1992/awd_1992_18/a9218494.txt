Abstract    :
              9218494  Taflove  This project seeks to develop novel  three-dimensional
              time-domain  algorithms for optical pulse  propagation, scattering, and 
              switching (including femtosecond  pulses) using the full vector  nonlinear
              time-domain Maxwell's  equations, with specific  applications of glass and 
              semiconductor materials.   Algorithms will be implemented on  supercomputers of
              the class of the  Cray C-90 or Cray T3D.  One  algorithm to be explored
              involves  solving a time-domain system of  ordinary differential equations for 
              the bandgap physics of  semiconductor materials  concurrently with the
              time-domain  vector Maxwell's equations.  This  algorithm could permit detailed
               modeling of the pulse dynamics of  passive and active optical and 
              electrooptic devices including  switches and laser sources.  A  second approach
              of interest  involves applying computational  fluid dynamics techniques for 
              tracking shock waves to model  possible optical shock waves in  nonlinear
              media.  Overall, the  project will develop and apply  novel time-domain
              algorithms to  explore the dynamics of a variety  of optical wave species in 
              nonlinear media in three  dimensions, including "light  bullets"  and
              shocked-wave optical  pulses.  These may exhibit  favorable properties  with
              respect  to all-optical switching at  relatively low laser power levels 
              because of unique properties  arising form their temporal and  spatial
              confinement or shocked  carrier, respectively.  There would  exist potential 
              engineering  applications in the realization of  novel ultra-fast
              sub-millimeter-  size all-optical digital logic  elements operation at low
              laser  power levels.  ***
