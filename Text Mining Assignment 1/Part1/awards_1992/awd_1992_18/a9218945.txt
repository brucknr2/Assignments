Abstract    :
                   This is a renewal; PI is constructing a calibrated sea-                   
              level curve based on stratigraphy of the stable part of the                    
              Russian platform.  Curve thus far is mostly at stage-level                     
              of resolution and has hiatuses due to (local)                                  
              unconformities.  This next phase will refine the curve to                      
              zonal level and fill gaps by incorporating data from the                       
              adjacent Caspian and West Siberian basins.  PI will also                       
              correlate bio- and sequence stratigraphic units in order to                    
              improve correlation to other areas on the globe, and apply                     
              the resulting sea-level curve to subsiding basins and                          
              passive margins to generate accurate basin subsidence                          
              histories and thermal subsidence curves.  Work will include                    
              incorporation of data provided by the Russian Academy of                       
              Sciences, and fieldwork to appropriate sites; collaboration                    
              with Russian colleagues is established.
