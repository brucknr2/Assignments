Abstract    :
              In this collaboration, Dr. Herbert Fried, of                                   
              the Brown University Department of Physics,                                    
              will work with Dr. Brian McKellar at the                                       
              Department of Physics of the University of                                     
              Melbourne, Australia, on problems associated                                   
              with the definition of the infrared                                            
              approximation in Quantum Chromodynamics, in a                                  
              non-perturbative formalism containing both                                     
              quarks and gluons, and the binding structure                                   
              of quark-antiquark and three-quark states.                                     
                                                                                             
              Current techniques and theory cannot be                                        
              applied to large-scale structure.  The U.S.                                    
              PI has recently defined new methods to                                         
              approach the problem and would collaborate                                     
              with Australia's leading expert in this                                        
              field.  The results may enhance our                                            
              understanding of the fundamental structure                                     
              and behavior of matter.
