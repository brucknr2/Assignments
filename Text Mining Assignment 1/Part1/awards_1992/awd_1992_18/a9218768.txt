Abstract    :
              This research proposal centers on two unique types of                          
              Precambrian iron-formations.  The first, of Archean age, is                    
              in the Serra dos Carajas region of Brazil and is considered                    
              the largest Archean deposit of high-grade iron ore in the                      
              world.  The second, is the iron and manganese region of                        
              Urucum which is of late Proterozoic age.  These two iron-                      
              formations which are very different in age, in                                 
              sedimentologic setting, and in extent, have been selected                      
              for detailed geologic, petrologic and geochemical studies                      
              (major elements, trace elements, REE, total organic carbon,                    
              and C isotopics where approximate).  In cooperation with                       
              Professor Eduardo A. Ladeira.  Results from these studies                      
              will allow for much improvement in the database for                            
              Precambrian iron-formations, and any conclusions as to their                   
              origin, for occurrences on a world-wide basis.
