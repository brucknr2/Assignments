Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The general objective of this project is to contribute to the                  
              understanding of time-varying biogeochemical fluxes in the oceanic             
              subtropical Pacific by adding a zooplankton sampling component to              
              the Hawaii Ocean Time-series (HOT) Program. The first three years              
              of sediment trap data from this Program have revealed seasonal and             
              interannual patterns in export fluxes that cannot be adequately                
              explained by concurrent variations in primary productivity. Since              
              large zooplankton and micronekton are implicated in the export of              
              organic material from surface waters by virtue of their production             
              of large, rapidly sinking fecal debris and active vertical                     
              migrations, we propose to use this opportunity to test the                     
              hypothesis that observed seasonal and interannual variability in               
              sediment trap flux are related to patterns in the occurrence of                
              zooplankton. The research program will include: (1) determining the            
              community biomass structure of zooplankton from dry weights,                   
              carbon, and nitrogen analyses of size-fractionated net collections;            
              (2) estimating the relative magnitudes of migrating and                        
              nonmigrating zooplankton from comparison of day- and night-time                
              catches: (3) assessing relative changes in the role of zooplankton             
              as direct consumers of primary producers from bulk gut fluorescence            
              analyses; and (4) estimating, from microscopical analyses, patterns            
              in the direct contribution of zooplankton fecal material to export             
              flux.
