Abstract    :
              9218951  Leventer  This award supports a study of the relationship between
              diatom  assemblages in surface sediments (from existing samples) along a 
              latitudinal transect and current oceanographic and environmental  conditions
              along the transect.  This work will determine the  viability of using diatom
              assemblages as proxy records of climate  since the last glacial maximum.  The
              work will use quantitative  methods to describe diatom assemblages and will
              include a test of  the model developed by studying diatoms in two sediment
              cores, one  from Bransfield Strait (open water) and the other from a fjord in 
              Gerlache Strait, in which there are already some paleoclimatic and 
              paleoenvironmental indicators to use as a baseline.  This study is  essential
              to the development of viable models relating records of  biological activity,
              and in particular diatom producing algae, to  climatic and environmental
              conditions.  ***
