Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The LMER (Land Margin Ecosystems Research) program addresses the               
              need for research on land-margin ecosystems, those at the interface            
              of continental land masses and  coastal oceans. The LMER program is            
              part of the U.S. Global Change Research program supported jointly              
              by the Biological Oceanography Program of the Division of Ocean                
              Sciences and the Long Term Ecosystems Studies Program of the                   
              Biological Sciences Directorate. These land margin ecosystems are              
              being affected by direct and indirect results of human population              
              growth, and land use changes. In the future, they may be severely              
              affected by rising sea levels as a result of global climate change.            
              The LMER program is designed to document and evaluate the changes              
              going on at this land sea interface. The LMER program at present is            
              made up of five large multi-investigator, interdisciplinary                    
              research projects that emphasize experimental studies, various                 
              types of models, and a comparative ecosystems approach.                        
                                                                                             
              This project seeks to establish and maintain an LMER coordinating              
              office and committee headed by John Hobbie of the Marine Biological            
              Laboratory as chair in order to carry out the many functions                   
              necessary for a large interdisciplinary program.  The various tasks            
              of the coordination office include: the planning and coordinating              
              meetings for the Steering committee and the LMER scientists to                 
              facilitate activities, synthses and intercomparisons within the                
              LMER research projects and coordinating activities with other                  
              coastal oriented programs as well as other global change research              
              programs on the national and international level.
