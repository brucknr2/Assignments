Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This award supports the participation of 12 U.S. scientists in a               
              U.S.-Japan Seminar on Site Response and Ground Failure during                  
              Earthquakes, to be held June 7-9, 1993 in Northern California.                 
              The co-organizers are Professor I.M. Idriss, University of                     
              California, Davis, and Professor Kenji Ishihara, University of                 
              Tokyo.  The objective of the seminar is to exchange information                
              on geotechnical earthquake engineering in such areas as                        
              liquefaction in sandy soils and the consequences of liquefaction               
              and the response of soil sites underlain by layers of soft soils               
              that can amplify the seismic motions (particularly in the long                 
              period range) and thus pose additional hazards to structures and               
              other facilities constructed at such sites.                                    
                                                                                             
              Seminar sessions will focus on the latest advances in ground                   
              response and amplification effects, site characterization, ground              
              failure (case histories such as the Loma Prieta Earthquake), and               
              analysis of liquefaction-induced flow failures and deformations.               
              The participants include some young researchers and some                       
              scientists who have already formed close collaborative ties with               
              Japanese scientists.  This seminar is a valuable step in the                   
              continuing efforts to understand and to incorporate into design                
              and practice, measures to mitigate the effects of earthquake                   
              strong ground shaking as manifest through site response and                    
              ground failure.
