Abstract    :
              Professor Wolczanski of Cornell University will conduct                        
              investigations of early transition metal oxo and nitrido                       
              compounds with funding from the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and                   
              Organometallic Program.  In one phase of the studies he will                   
              investigate small molecule activation by low-coordinate                        
              electrophilic metal centers such as zirconium and titanium                     
              compounds of bulky hard pi donors.  Reactions of these                         
              compounds with alkanes, alkenes, and arenes will be studied for                
              their ability to cleave the C-H and C-C bonds.  The other phase                
              of the work will be directed towards preparing new materials by                
              use of early transition metal complexes as precursors.  These                  
              precursors will have strong pi donor ligands such as nitrides                  
              and amides.  It is anticipated that use of these precursors                    
              will enable the synthesis of materials that are more complex                   
              than those obtained by conventional high-temperature methods.                  
              %%%                                                                            
              The chemistry of a class of early transition metal molecules                   
              that have bonds through nitrogen and oxygen atoms will be                      
              studied for two reasons.  One is that these compounds display                  
              unusual and unique reactivity with C-C and C-H bonds in other                  
              molecules.  The other is that they can be used as molecular                    
              precursors in the synthesis of novel materials of high                         
              complexity.  It is hoped that these studies will lead to                       
              improved methods of controlling the reactivity of hydrocarbons                 
              and of designing interesting materials.
