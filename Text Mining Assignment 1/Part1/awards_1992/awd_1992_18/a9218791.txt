Abstract    :
                   New analytical approaches have made possible the high                     
              quality, reproducible 18O/16O analysis of diatom silica.                       
              These techniques could be applied to diatomaceous sediments                    
              from oceanic and lacustrine environments to obtain detailed                    
              information on paleoclimate and climate change.  However,                      
              some evidence suggest that the fractionation of oxygen                         
              isotopes between biogenic opal and water may be kinetically                    
              controlled.  If so, diatom  18O may depend partly on the                       
              silicic acid content of the water from which diatoms extract                   
              their silica.  Because the silica concentration of ancient                     
              lakes and seas would seldom be known, a silicic-acid                           
              dependence--if on exists--could diminish the precision of an                   
              otherwise promising paleothermometer.  In this                                 
              investigation, marine and lacustrine diatoms will be                           
              cultured to learn whether their  18O depends on the silicic                    
              acid content of the environmental water.  A kinetic                            
              fractionation model will be developed if a dependence is                       
              found.  Diatom silica is valuable source of information                        
              having application to paleohydrologic studies.
