Abstract    :
                   This award is one of two separate awards being made for a                 
              collaborative project between Dr. Alan Plumb of MIT and Dr. Lorenzo            
              Polvani of Columbia University (ATM-9217844).  Their research                  
              involves the simulation and understanding of nonlinear aspects of              
              large-scale wave and eddy motions in the atmosphere, using the                 
              technique of contour dynamics with surgery (CD/S).  This is an                 
              efficient computational procedure for the investigation at high                
              resolution of processes such as the spectral cascade of enstrophy              
              in highly nonlinear flows.  The PIs plan to apply this technique to            
              investigate further the dynamics of the stratospheric polar vortex,            
              the interaction of quasi-stationary long waves and the Rossby wave             
              dispersion relation in situations where the potential vorticity                
              gradient is concentrated rather than continuous from pole to pole.             
              In addition, they have developed a technique of contour advection              
              with surgery (CA/S) in which the numerical procedures of the CD/S              
              approach have been used to develop a sophisticated trajectory code.            
              This is a diagnostic method which can reveal much about the                    
              distortion and buckling of material surfaces in observed flows, and            
              it will be applied to investigate such effects in the stratosphere             
              and in the upper troposphere.
