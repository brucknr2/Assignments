Abstract    :
              9218907  Okal                             This research is to study the seismic
              structure of the Ontong-  Java Plateau, the largest expression of igneous
              activity of the  ocean floor.  Four seismic stations composed of PASSCAL
              instruments  will be deployed for two years on the Micronesian islands of
              Chuuk,  Pohnpei, Kosrae and Nauru.  Earthquake sources in the Solomon 
              subduction zone will be used to investigate the dispersion of  surface waves
              over the plateau to measure seismic structure to  depths on the order of 200
              km.  Concurrently, a number of body-wave  experiments will be conducted
              targeting the structural anisotropy  of the crust and upper mantle in the area.
               The work is expected to  provide answers to such questions as the exact
              thickness of the  crust, the nature of the deep crust, the structure of the
              mantle  (lid and underlying low-velocity zone) of the plateau, and the  extent
              and direction of anisotropy in the upper mantle.  In turn,  these parameters
              will put constraints on the environment and  mechanism of emplacement of the
              plateau in the Cretaceous.  ***
