              Hoppeler, B. Kayser, and G. Ferretti of                                        
              Switzerland.  The project aims to study the                                    
              physiological adaptation of human respiratory                                  
              muscles at high altitude.                                                      
                                                                                             
              The researchers will examine strength and                                      
              endurance in these muscles after chronic, high-                                
              intensity, whole-body training designed to                                     
              elicit potent hypoxic, exercise hyperpnea.                                     
              They will test the hypothesis that respiratory                                 
              muscles, unlike other engaged skeletal muscles,                                
              do not exhibit increased strength and endurance                                
              during pure exercise training, but that an                                     
              additional stress, hypoxia, is also required                                   
              for this effect.  The project will increase                                    
              understanding of respiratory muscles'                                          
              adaptability.  The Bolivian side will benefit                                  
              from learning research methodologies in which                                  
              the U.S. and other participants have developed                                 
              expertise.  The U.S. side will gain from                                       
              conducting the study with subjects at a high-
