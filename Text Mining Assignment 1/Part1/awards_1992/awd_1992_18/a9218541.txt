Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This is a request for continued funding for investigations of                  
              kinematics and rigidity of the Indian Ocean plate and the zone of              
              distributed deformation between the Indian and Australian plates.              
              Aeromagnetic data were collected in the area during the first part             
              of this study and the PI proposes here to extend the study to                  
              finite plate reconstructions.  The goals are to estimate finite                
              rotations and confidence limits on the motion between India,                   
              Africa, and Australia.
