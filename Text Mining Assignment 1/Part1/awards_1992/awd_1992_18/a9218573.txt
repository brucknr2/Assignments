Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This investigation is concerned with the further development of                
              Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy (NMR) as a method to                   
              determine the three-dimensional structures of larger biomolecules              
              in solution.  It is only very recently that labeling with stable               
              isotopes and the use of three- and four- dimensional heteronuclear             
              NMR has allowed the structure determination of proteins larger than            
              10 kDa in solution.  Here the solution structure determination of              
              a larger alpha helical proteins.  These challenges form the                    
              backbone of the proposal and will be approached with improvements              
              in efficiency by using heteronuclear cross polarization, with                  
              improvements in resolution by using multiple quantum filters and a             
              larger number of dimensions and with improvements in analysis of               
              key multi-dimensional NMR experiments.

              Recent developments in the methods of Nuclear Magnetic Resonance               
              Spectroscopy have made possible the determination of the three-                
              dimensional structures of smaller proteins in solution.  Three                 
              dimensional solution structures are relevant to the understanding              
              of their biological functioning, can convey dynamic information and            
              may be obtained by NMR in cases where other methods fail because of            
              lack of crystals.  This proposal describes investigations into the             
              development of more advanced NMR methods to help analyze the                   
              solution NMR spectra of larger proteins, nucleic acids and                     
              complexes thereof.  The studies will be carried out with a medium-             
              sized protein as a model system.  The new methods will make NMR                
              structure determination possible for larger proteins and nucleic               
              acids and thus contribute to the better understanding of structure             
              and function in this larger class of biomolecules.
