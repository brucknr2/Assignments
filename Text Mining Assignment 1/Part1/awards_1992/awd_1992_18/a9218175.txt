Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This award supports the participation of 14 U.S. scientists in a               
              U.S.-Japan Seminar on the Origins, Development, and Spread of                  
              Prehistoric North Pacific-Bering Sea Martime Cultures, to be held              
              in Hawaii May 31 - June 6, 1993.  The co-organizers are Professor              
              Allen McCartney of the University of Arkansas and Professor Hiroaki            
              Okada of Hokkaido University.  In addition to the U.S. and Japanese            
              participants, scholars from Canada and Russia will be invited.  The            
              purpose of the seminar is to discuss archaeological data, methods,             
              and theoretical approaches appropriate to the study of prehistoric             
              maritime adaptations in the North Pacific-Bering Sea regions, with             
              emphasis on parallel and divergent cultural processes and possible             
              cultural connections between Asia and North America.                           
                                                                                             
              Knowledge of the dynamics and history of maritime adaptations is               
              basic to a full understanding of North Pacific and Bering Sea                  
              native cultures.  Earliest peoples reaching the Japanese islands               
              from the Asian mainland and reaching Alaska from Chukotka Peninsula            
              during Pleistocene times may have been, in part, maritime adapted.             
              Subsequent coastal societies of much of the past 10,000 years have             
              exploited the rich marine resources of these regions, giving rise              
              to historic Eskimos, Aluets, and Northwest Coast Indians in North              
              America and to Eskimos, Maritime Chukchi, Koriaks, and Ainu in                 
              Asia.  This conference will be the first opportunity for so many               
              archaeologists working in contiguous areas to discuss substantive,             
              methodological, and theoretical issues in detail.
