Abstract    :
              One of the most important events that have impact on plant growth,             
              development, and productivity is the distribution of photosynthetic            
              products, usually sugar molecules, throughout the organs of the                
              plant.  The distribution depends on regulating sugar transport                 
              across the plasma membrane of plant cells.  It has been speculated             
              that this process involves carrier molecules, however, very little             
              is known about the carrier molecules themselves.  Recently, Drs.               
              Grimes and Hitz and their collaborators have identified and cloned             
              a plasma membrane protein that appears to possess all the right                
              characteristics to be a sucrose transporter.  In this project, Drs.            
              Grimes and Hitz will further characterize the nature and role of               
              this protein, called 62 SBP, using various approaches including                
              membrane physiology, protein analysis, genetic engineering and                 
              immunology.  They will also collaborate with a group in Germany who            
              has identified another membrane protein that appears to play a role            
              in sucrose transport.  It is generally believed that sucrose                   
              transport system is complex, consisting of several components.                 
              Therefore, this collaboration is likely to enhance the opportunity             
              to advance our understanding of  the sucrose transport process in              
              higher plants.  The primary experimental system for this project is            
              soybean cotyledon as virtually all of the cells in the soybean                 
              cotyledon are actively transporting sucrose.                                   
                                                                                             
              Successful completion of this project will provide a tool to                   
              further studies of the mechanisms by which plants distribute their             
              photosynthetic products,  which will ultimately contribute to our              
              understanding of the mechanisms of growth and development in                   
              plants.
