Abstract    :
              This award will support participants costs to a conference in                  
              computational biology:  Patterns of Biological Organization.  The              
              conference will be in Rensselaerville, New York on October 8-11,               
              1992.  The topics to be covered include sequence analysis an                   
              secondary structure, tertiary structure prediction, applications of            
              structure prediction, recognition and assembly, and development.               
              The award will foster interdisciplinary research and will provide              
              support for junior researchers to attend this conference.
