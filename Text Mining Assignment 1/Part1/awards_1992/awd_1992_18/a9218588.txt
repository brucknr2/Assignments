Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The establishment of the embryonic body plan during the development            
              of many animals results from the asymmetric distribution of                    
              molecules or organelles in the egg.  One particularly clear example            
              is the specification of anterior development in Drosophila embryos.            
              The messenger RNA of the bicoid gene is localized at the anterior              
              margin of the egg during oogenesis; following fertilization the                
              bicoid protein activates the expression of anterior-specific                   
              zygotic genes.  Experiments in this proposal are directed toward               
              learning how bicoid RNA is localized during oogenesis, including               
              molecular associations of the RNA and the cellular mechanisms of               
              localization.  Proposed experiments include an investigation of                
              molecular interactions that cause bicoid RNA to be associated with             
              the cytoskeleton or other large organelles, particularly the                   
              involvement of microtubules in this process.  The function of the              
              swallow gene in bicoid RNA localization during oogenesis will be               
              investigated in experiments to learn whether swallow protein is                
              associated with bicoid RNA, and to identify functionally important             
              parts of the swallow protein.  A search of the group of maternal               
              effect genes with early arrest phenotypes will be made for other               
              genes whose products are involved in bicoid RNA localization.  The             
              time course of bicoid RNA localization will be monitored through               
              the construction and expression of an inducible RNA that is                    
              localized via the bicoid pathway, allowing tests of the idea that              
              bicoid RNA is transported to the oocyte by an active mechanism.
