Abstract    :
              9218370  Shor       In this project the PIs will examine the problem of how
              subduction  initiates at the Macquarie Ridge complex, which occurs 1500km south
               of New Zealand and separates Pacific and Australian plates (Triple  Junction
              with the Antarctic plate isn't too far either). The P.I.s  argue that this is
              the best place in the world where to study this  process. The field program
              includes side-scan sonar/bathymetric  swath (Hawaii MR1), 6-channel seismic
              reflection, and gravity  measurements aboard Moana Wave. The P.I.s will
              determine the  deformation process and test two different models of subduction 
              initiation.
