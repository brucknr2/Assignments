Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Hydrogen sulfide is an extremely toxic industrial waste responsible            
              for a number of deaths in California in the last year alone.  These            
              incidents involved a paper recycling factory in Los Angeles                    
              enveloped by a cloud of toxic sulfide gas and a railroad spill of              
              metam sodium resulting in the release of methyl isothiocyanate and             
              hydrogen sulfide gas as breakdown products.  The proposed project              
              investigates sulfide detoxification in the peripheral tissues of a             
              marine worm.  Although our previous studies of adaptations to low              
              oxygen and sulfide indicate that this animal detoxifies sulfide in             
              internal fluids, the question of how the body tissues are protected            
              or tolerate toxic sulfide remains unanswered.  Preliminary data                
              suggest that the peripheral tissues possess distinct sulfide                   
              detoxification or tolerance mechanisms, including the presence of              
              sulfide-oxidizing bodies and symbiotic bacteria.  The binding or               
              transformation of sulfide to nontoxic forms of sulfur in the                   
              external body tissues.  Elucidation of these peripheral defense                
              mechanisms will provide a significant contribution to the                      
              understanding of tolerance and treatment of sulfide poisoning.                 
              Additionally, the studies outlined in the proposal will contribute             
              to the well established field of sulfide metabolism and                        
              detoxification in animals.  Funding of the research project would              
              result in continued assistance to undergraduate and graduate                   
              students and be a significant contribution to the research                     
              environment at San Francisco State University.
