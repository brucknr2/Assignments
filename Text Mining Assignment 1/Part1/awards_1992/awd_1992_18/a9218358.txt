Abstract    :
              The proposed research deals with in vivo studies of the role of                
              charged and uncharged tRNA molecules in the efficiency, accuracy,              
              and regulation of translational elongation.  (1) Cells with two                
              kinds of tRNA mutations, miaA and ts-tRNATRP, will be transformed              
              with modified RF2 frameshift constructs and tests will be made of              
              the efficiency of the programmed frameshifts.  Effects on these                
              frameshifts of overexpressing tRNATRP from a cloned plasmid gene               
              will also be determined.  (2) Both wild type and hyperaccurate Smp             
              strains containing the modified RF2 frameshift constructs will be              
              subjected to manipulation both of charged and uncharged tRNATRP.               
              Effects of uncharged tRNA and the fraction of charged tRNA on these            
              programmed frameshifts will be determined.  (3) A specific peptide             
              from the MS2 coat protein containing residue 32, encoded by a UGG              
              (Trp) codon, will be isolated in order to determine (by radioactive            
              lableing and peptide mapping) what amino acid(s) is inserted at                
              this position during Trp limitation.  (4) The effect of                        
              manipulating charged and uncharged tRNATRP levels on the frequency             
              of substitutions at Trp codons during rate-limiiting elongation                
              will be examined.  (5) A vector system to test translational                   
              efficiency of low- versus high-usage codons will be placed in the              
              hyperaccurate Smp strains in order to test whether fidelity                    
              conditions alter "translational polarity".                                     
              %%%                                                                            
              During cell growth, aging, starvation, and disease protein                     
              synthesis is modulated.  Although many hypotheses have been                    
              developed about how such regulation is accomplished and what the               
              cell gains through such regulation, very few studies have been                 
              designed to evaluate the regulation of synthesis at the level of               
              translation in living cells.  The studies proposed here take                   
              advantage of a unique genetic/biochemical system which permits                 
              control of the concentrations of specific tRNA molecules in living             
              cells and evaluating the protein synthetic effects of varying these            
              tRNA levels.
