Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The goal of this work is to conduct preliminary structural analysis            
              on fullerenes, using a high-resolution transmission electron                   
              microscope (HRTEM) facility.  In essence, this Research Planning               
              Grant is designed to develop a collaboration between the Principal             
              Investigator who installed the HRTEM facility and members of                   
              another group at the same institute who discovered methods for bulk            
              production of fullerenes and the subsequent crystal growth.                    
              Graduate students from two groups are trained in the use of the                
              HRTEM technique.  The HRTEM facility is uniquely suitable for                  
              structural analysis in the 10 to 100-oA range for a variety of                 
              structures and topographies such as higher fullerenes, tubular and             
              intercalated geometries, and for examination of novel compounds                
              having metal atoms or ions in between carbon frame or encased                  
              within carbon spheres.  The results of preliminary studies will be             
              used to prepare a full proposal for NSF.                                       
                                                                                             
              Fullerence chemistry has created a frontier avenue for the                     
              synthesis and fabrication of new materials with unusual optical and            
              magneto-optical properties.  The characterization of fullerenes and            
              associated compounds is uniquely served by the use of the                      
              nanoanalytical TEM facility.  The training of graduate students on             
              this facility, and the preliminary results obtained as the                     
              consequence of this research planning proposal will contribute to              
              the better understanding of the fullerene field and to the                     
              development of women scientists in the frontier areas of chemistry.
