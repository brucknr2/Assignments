Abstract    :
              Braeside Observatory has monitored a variety of variable stars for             
              the past thirteen years.  The instrumentation at the observatory               
              will be upgraded through the addition of a CCD camera.  This will              
              allow observations of fainter stars and will allow observations                
              even when weather conditions are mediocre.  In the immediate future            
              emphasis will be placed on monitoring nova-like variables and dwarf            
              novae.  A number of high school students will be involved in this              
              project.
