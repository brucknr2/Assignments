Abstract    :
              In recent years, cold-formed steel structures have been widely used            
              in building construction and other applications.  A large number               
              of research projects have been performed in the United States and              
              Australia to study the strengths of individual cold-formed steel               
              members, connections and structural systems.  In order to provide              
              a forum for American and Australian experts to discuss the recent              
              research findings and the latest developments in this particular               
              field and to identify future research needs, an International                  
              Workshop is to be held at the University of Sydney, Australia, on              
              February 15-17, 1993.  The discussion  will be concentrated on                 
              numerous specific subjects relative to (1) behavior of the                     
              thin-walled elements, (2) flexural members, (3) compression                    
              members, (4) purlin-sheeting systems, (5) composite decks, (6)                 
              tubular members (7) sandwich panels, (8) connections, (9) test                 
              methods, (10) automotive components, (11) specification                        
              developments, and (12) structural systems.  These topics are                   
              directly related to the transfer of technology  and have economic              
              significance for  the development of new design recommendations                
              and construction methods.
