Abstract    :
                This research will map the 3-D P- and S-wave velocity structures             
              in the crust of southern California by tomographically inverting               
              over 1.5 million P- and S-wave first-arrival times from over 80,000            
              local events recorded by the Caltech/USGS network since 1981.  The             
              massive data size and the demand for a full 3-D raytracing due to              
              known large lateral inhomogeneities in the crust have imposed a                
              major computational challenge to conventional methods.  By an                  
              innovative Master Station Method of incorporating 3-D ray tracing,             
              however, the P and S structures will be imaged simultaneously in               
              this project with relocation of summarized events.  The primary                
              objectives are to construct P and S crustal velocity models for                
              southern California at one order higher resolution than the latest             
              P velocity model, to relocate earthquakes and re-examine first-                
              motion focal mechanisms in areas of large bias by routine                      
              processing, and to gain insight into the crustal seismo-tectonic               
              processes through integrated analysis of all known geophysical and             
              geological information.  This research is a component of the                   
              National Earthquake Hazard Reduction Program.
