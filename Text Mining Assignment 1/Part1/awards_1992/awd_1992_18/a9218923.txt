Abstract    :
              9218923  O'Connell         The research is to study flow in the mantle where
              large  viscosity variations are present.  This includes the rise of plumes 
              through the mantle, and the sinking of strong lithosphere as  subducted slabs. 
              The aim is to understand how the dynamics of the  ascent of plumes is related
              to the rheological and thermal  properties of the mantle, and how they interact
              with the core-  mantle boundary, the transition zone and the Earth's surface.  
              Another aim is to  understand the deformation of sinking slabs, and  to relate
              their seismicity and shape to the structure and dynamics  of the mantle, and to
              determine how slabs interact with rheological  and thermodynamic boundaries in
              the transition zone.  The analysis  of the problems will use the boundary
              integral method, which allows  internal boundaries to be followed through large
              displacements and  deformations, and makes the treatment of some
              three-dimensional  subduction and plume problems feasible.  The method will be 
              extended to treat a phase boundary.  ***
