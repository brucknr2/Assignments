Abstract    :
              Because the cooling times for white dwarfs are very long, the                  
              oldest stars in the galaxy have not yet faded below detection                  
              limits.  Thus, the white dwarf luminosity function should show a               
              sudden drop-off below the luminosity they could have reached in the            
              age of the population from which they evolved.  This fact can be               
              used to determine that age.  Unfortunately, the stars in question              
              are faint and the numbers found in the galactic disk are too small             
              to provide a good statistical sample.  Few, if any, are known in               
              the halo.  A CCD camera on the McDonald Observatory 30 inch                    
              telescope in Texas will be employed to search for cool, faint white            
              dwarfs in both the disk population and the halo.  This will                    
              increase greatly the sample of such stars known and will make them             
              much more useful for studying the star formation history and age of            
              the populations they represent.
