Abstract    :
              9218600  Klemperer         The Tibetan Plateau is the most prominent continental
              feature  on our planet and probably one of the most controversial.  The 
              controversy stems from the combination of inherent complexity and  lack of
              data.  Knowledge of the crustal structure and lithology of  the plateau is
              essential to addressing the questions involved -  questions that are central
              for the understanding of some of the  most fundamental processes shaping the
              continental lithosphere.         Following a decade of political efforts, the
              COCORP group  managed to establish collaboration with the Chinese Ministry of 
              Geology and Mineral Resources (MGMR) to collect seismic reflection  data across
              the Himalaya/Tibetan plateau.  As the initial test  phase of project INDEPTH
              (International Deep Profiling of Tibet and  the Himalaya), a 100-km long
              profile has been collected in southern  Tibet during the summer season of 1992.
                      The Crustal Geophysics group of Stanford University was  invited to
              conduct a "piggy-back" experiment.  The group took a  multi-disciplinary
              approach, and acquired wide-angle reflection,  cross-lines, gravity, magnetic
              and remote-sensing data.  Their  purpose was to provide the lithological
              controls so important in  resolving between the wealth of existing models, and
              to record  auxiliary data needed for the complete interpretation of the main 
              COCORP profile.         This project involves the analysis and interpretation
              of this  unique data set and will be undertaken in close collaboration with 
              both the COCORP group and the Chinese MGMR scientists under project  INDEPTH.
