Abstract    :
              Tektites are the product of melting and quenching of                           
              terrestrial rocks during hypervelocity impacts on the Earth.                   
              The advent of the highly-sensitive negative thermal                            
              ionization technique (NTIMS) for Re-Os isotopic analysis                       
              makes this system ideally suited to the problem of                             
              understanding the often elevated siderophile element content                   
              of tektites.  The P.I.s propose to carry out Re-Os isotopic                    
              studies by NTIMS on tektites from the Australasian and Ivory                   
              Coast Strewn fields and on the Auoelloul glasses.  With the                    
              Re-Os isotopic system there is the unique opportunity to                       
              determine if the Os found in tektites is really                                
              extraterrestrial, crustal or a mixture of both.  This is                       
              necessary for showing whether the siderophile element                          
              signatures in tektites are a result of meteorite                               
              contamination or in-situ reduction of the target rocks.
