Abstract    :
                   The Wyoming Province exposes one of the most                              
              isotopically evolved Archean cratons.  The Wyoming Province                    
              forms an early part of the north American Precambrian                          
              shield, to which younger terranes were accreted.  However,                     
              the origin of the province is unclear, with some isotopic                      
              data suggesting that it was derived from an older reservoir                    
              that must have been older than 4.0 Ga if it U/Pb ratio was                     
              comparable to average crust.  Determining the age and                          
              composition of this older reservoir is crucial for                             
              understanding the processes that lead to the transformation                    
              of this craton from an older, relatively high U/Pb system to                   
              a low U/Pb system by the end of the Archean.  The work                         
              involves a detailed geologic and geochemical investigation,                    
              including SHRIMP U-Pb geochronology, of the Middle to Early                    
              Archean crust in the Beartooth Mountains where the evolved                     
              isotopic signature is best documented.  Results will be                        
              important in constraining the processes involved in Earth's                    
              early geochemical differentiation.
