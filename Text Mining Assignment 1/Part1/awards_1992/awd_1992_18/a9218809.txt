Abstract    :
                This research is to investigate the implications of a new,                   
              unusually long (at least two hours) seismic wave train having                  
              periods of about 230 sec that was recorded at seismic stations                 
              throughout the world following the major eruption of Mount Pinatubo            
              in the Philippines on June 15, 1991.  Preliminary analysis                     
              indicates that this was a Rayleigh wave excited by atmospheric                 
              oscillations near the volcano that were set off by continuous                  
              thermal energy flux from the volcano.  If this conclusion is                   
              correct, one can expect similar oscillations for other eruptions               
              observed on the new NSF-supported Global Seismic Network (GSN).                
              Acoustically coupled Rayleigh waves can be used for detection,                 
              characterization and quantification of major volcanic eruptions and            
              for study of the properties of the Earth's atmosphere.  A                      
              quantitative description of the source is desirable as it would                
              allow us to estimate the amount of material injected in to the                 
              atmosphere which in turn permits us to estimate the general impact             
              on the environment.  Volcanic plumes pose a particular threat to               
              air traffic and the seismic signal emitted by large volcanic                   
              eruptions has the potential to yield rapid estimates about the                 
              plume dimensions.
