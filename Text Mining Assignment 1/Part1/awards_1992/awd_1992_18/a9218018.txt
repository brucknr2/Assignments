Abstract    :
              In this project we will investigate                                            
              the semiconductor nonequilibrium

              We will attempt to demonstrate the                                             
              first observation of Rabi

              in atomic systems, but have not yet                                            
              been observed in semiconductors.                                               
              Our many-body calculations have                                                
              predicted that RO may be seen in                                               
              semiconductors when femetosecond                                               
              laser pulses shorter than the

              Also, these calculations predict

              We plan to quantitatively
