Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This project will add a long-slit spectroscopic capability to an               
              NSF supported infrared imaging system for the 1.8m Lowell                      
              Observatory telescope.  The spectroscopic option will provide three            
              complimentary capabilities:                                                    
                                                                                             
              o    A low resolution (lamda/delta lamda = 550) long slit (6.8')               
                   mode, which will disperse one of the J, H, or K atmospheric               
                   windows across the detector array in its entirety.                        
                                                                                             
              o    A cross-dispersed mode that allows observations at a                      
                   resolution of 550 of the entire useful wavelength range from              
                   1.18 to 2.45 (mu)m with a 30" long slit or from 0.96 to 2.45              
                   (mu)m for a point source.                                                 
                                                                                             
              o    A higher resolution (lamda/delta lamda = 1500) mode with a                
                   more restricted slit length (2.6'); a positionable grating                
                   mount will allow the selection of wavelengths in this mode.               
                                                                                             
              All the options, including the changeover from imaging to                      
              spectroscopic observing, will be remotely controlled and rapidly               
              selectable.                                                                    
                                                                                             
              There are two projects that the spectrometer will be directed                  
              towards:   studies of the stellar content of galaxies and of the               
              evolutionary status of young stellar objects.
