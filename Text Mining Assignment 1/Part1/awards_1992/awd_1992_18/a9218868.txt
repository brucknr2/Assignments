Abstract    :
              This award is for support of a two year proof-of-concept project to            
              deploy a newly designed and tested instrument which will allow                 
              quantitative measurements (with high temporal resolution) of snow              
              accumulation, mixing and erosion.  The instrument disperses inert              
              time markers in the snow surface at fixed time intervals which                 
              allows a quantitative measure of snow accumulation rate and its                
              spatial uniformity.  This work has important applications to the               
              interpretation of paleoclimatic records from snow pits and ice                 
              cores.
