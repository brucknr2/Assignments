Abstract    :
              An important aspect of this program is that the observational                  
              data from this campaign will be made available to all interested               
              solar physicists.                                                              
              The instrument that is proposed will be a small, low-scattered-                
              light refracting telescope consisting of a 15-cm doublet, a fast               
              guider, a 0.2 nm CaII K filter and several additional filters for              
              continuum observations at other wavelengths, and a commercial                  
              2048x2048 CCD camera.  The entire enclosed telescope package will              
              be on an equatorial mount.  Data rates will be sufficiently low                
              that a pc-class computer can be used for both telescope control                
              and data acquisition.                                                          
              This proposal will aid in making the High-Degree Helioseismometer              
              data available to the community.  This instrument, which was                   
              operated last year at the South Pole, has been installed at the                
              Kitt Peak Vacuum Telescope, and is now producing high-quality Ca               
              K-line images.  With the modest help requested here, these data                
              will be made available to the community on a weekly basis.  This               
              will start important science associated with the Sun's variable                
              radiative output now.  In addition, the project can begin                      
              purchasing equipment needed for a future RISE PSPT telescope.
