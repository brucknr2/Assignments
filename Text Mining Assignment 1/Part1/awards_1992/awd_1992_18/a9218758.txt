Abstract    :
              This grant is to help support a                                                
              conference/workshop on photonic packaging.  It is                              
              a follow-on to a wrokshop from a similar one                                   
              supported by NSF one year ago.  It was clear that                              
              packaging is a much more important subject than                                
              previously thought and the first workshop only                                 
              scratched the surface.  This year the topic areas to                           
              be discussed are: hybrid multi-chip integration and                            
              waveguide interconnects.
