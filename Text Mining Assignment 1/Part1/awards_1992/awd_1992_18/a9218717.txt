Abstract    :
              Halite-bearing evaporites occur to substantial depths in 3 arid                
              closed-basins in the western U.S. and preserve a record of                     
              paleoclimate for more than 2 million years.  This project will                 
              examine the paleoclimate record in salt deposits from these basins             
              over the last 3 glacial-interglacial cycles (approximately 300,000             
              years) using existing samples and materials from 2 boreholes to be             
              drilled to depths of 100 m.  Emphasis will be on chemical analyses             
              of fluid inclusions in crystals of primary halite and other                    
              evaporite minerals to obtain:  activity of H2O and the major                   
              element chemistry (microthermometry and leachate analysis),                    
              hydrogen and oxygen isotopic composition of fluid inclusion waters             
              (Mass spectrometry), and atmospheric gas composition, for those                
              crystals which contain trapped air (quadrupole mass spectrometry).             
              Fluid inclusions and supplementary data (sedimentology, mineralogy,            
              petrography) may potentially be used to interpret paleoclimates,               
              in terms of:  (1) basin aridity, (2) relative temperatures, (3)                
              atmospheric chemistry, (4) lacustrine water chemistry and brine                
              evolution, and (5) closed-basin depositional settings.  Local and              
              global influences on paleoclimate will be distinguished by                     
              comparing data with the record from a fourth closed-basin (Searles             
              Lake), Great Basin vein calcites, polar ice cores, and the marine              
              oxygen isotope record.  Possible local influences of hydrothermal              
              fluids on the hydrologic record will be examined at Bristol Dry                
              Lake, where Holocene volcanic activity is well documented.  Dating             
              of halite will done using U-series methods and 36Cl, and will be               
              supplemented by tephrachronology.                                              
              Long term records of the hydrosphere and atmosphere are needed to              
              document continental paleoclimates and how such climates have been             
              influenced by global and local processes.  Nonmarine evaporites and            
              associated closed-basin sediments, because of the special climatic             
              and hydrologic conditions necessary for their formation, hold great            
              promise for understanding ancient continental climates.
