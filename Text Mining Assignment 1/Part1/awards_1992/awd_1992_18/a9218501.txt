Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              It is proposed to explore a new approach for the realization of a              
              high-density, high-mobility, 2D electron layer in the hitherto-                
              unexplored quantum-Wigner-crystal regime.  Quantum correlations                
              will be investigated by measuring tunneling rates out of the layer.            
              The experiments should also give access to the dynamic aspects of              
              tunneling in the presence of many-body interactions.
