Abstract    :
              Most of our knowledge of the chromosphere of the sun is based on               
              spectral features which originate in hot plasmas.  However, the                
              chromosphere is very inhomogeneous and also contains relatively                
              cool regions.  The infrared bands from CO will be observed to study            
              this cooler gas in the sun and other stars.  Numerical simulations             
              will be constructed to understand these observations in conjunction            
              with observations of the hot plasma.  This work will shed light on             
              the elusive question of the source of heating of the solar                     
              chromosphere.
