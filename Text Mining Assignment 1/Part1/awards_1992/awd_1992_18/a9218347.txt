Abstract    :
                            9218347  Tong  The goal of this project is to purify,
              characterize, and determine  the effects on flavor and ripening of an
              endogenous tomato fruit  trigger of ethylene production which we have
              previously partially  purified from fruit cell walls.  This trigger is produced
              when the  fruit are unripe and before ethylene production begins.  It will 
              induce ethylene synthesis and red color development in normal  ripening fruit
              as well as in mutant fruit that normally do not  produce ethylene or turn red
              when ripe.  It clearly has a role in  fruit ripening, affecting ethylene
              synthesis and therefore fruit  softening and color development.  Preliminary
              characterization of  the trigger has shown that it contains both carbohydrate
              and  protein.  The proposed project will 1) determine if both  carbohydrate and
              protein are necessary for trigger activity by  selectively degrading the
              carbohydrate or protein moiety using  enzymes or chemicals and then testing for
              activity, and 2) purify  the endogenous trigger using various chromatographic
              procedures.   Achieving the goals of this project should provide new
              information  in an under-studied area of plant hormone research, the onset of 
              hormone production.  ***
