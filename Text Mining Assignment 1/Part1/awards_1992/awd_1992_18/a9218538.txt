Abstract    :
              The objective of this project is to obtain quantitative cloud                  
              condensation nuclei (CCN) data at Palmer Station, Antarctica, using            
              a CCN spectrometer of the principal investigator's own design.  The            
              project is integrated with a study of tropospheric sulfur chemistry            
              in order to examine the climatic negative feedback mechanism                   
              involving atmospheric CCN and the emission of dimethylsulfide (DMS)            
              from oceanic phytoplankton.  DMS is oxidized and converted to CCN              
              in the atmosphere, with the increased concentration of CCN leading             
              to more extensive marine stratus clouds.  The increased cloud                  
              cover, because it reflects a greater proportion of the incoming                
              solar radiation, is hypothesized to produce large-scale atmospheric            
              cooling.  The net cooling and the reduced solar radiation at the               
              surface reduce the oceanic phytoplankton population and the rate of            
              DMS emission.                                                                  
                                                                                             
              The remote location of Palmer Station, and the establishment of the            
              two-year study of atmospheric sulfur chemistry offers a unique                 
              opportunity to study quantitative relationships, not only between              
              CCN and DMS, but also with other transient and stable sulfur                   
              compounds such as non-sea salt sulfates, methane sulfonate, and                
              sulfuric acid, as well as dry aerosols and sea salt particles.
