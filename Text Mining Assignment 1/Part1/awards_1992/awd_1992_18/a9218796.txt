Abstract    :
              The transition from exponential to stationary phase growth in                  
              bacteria heralds extensive changes in biochemical, macromolecular,             
              morphological and physiological properties.  Stationary phase                  
              conditions in the laboratory may accurately reflect predominant                
              conditions in the environment, where the unique properties of                  
              stationary phase cells are probably critical for competition and               
              survival.  Current evidence suggests that alterations in the                   
              pattern of gene expression, mediated via the effects of a few                  
              global regulatory factors, program these extensive changes.                    
              Glycogen (a-1,4 glucan with a-1,6 branches) biosynthesis is                    
              transcriptionally activated during early stationary phase in                   
              Escherichia coli.  Our recent analysis of glycogen-overproducing               
              mutants indicates that a previously uncharacterized regulatory                 
              system controls glycogen synthesis.  This project is testing the               
              hypothesis that the pleiotropic transposon-insertion mutation, TR1-            
              5, disrupts a component of a novel global regulatory system.  The              
              mutated gene is being sequenced and the mechanism of its effects on            
              the expression of glycogen biosynthesis genes (glg) and other E.               
              coli genes will be studied to elucidate its potential role in                  
              stationary phase adaptation.  Although a-1,4 glucans are the                   
              predominant biological storage compounds and are important                     
              industrial products, the biological function of bacterial glycogen             
              has not been rigorously established.  Therefore, this project will             
              also address the biological function of glycogen using survival and            
              recovery experiments conducted with isogenic glycogen mutants.

              This research is expected to provide information useful in                     
              achieving maximum gene expression in bacteria growing in industrial            
              fermentors.
