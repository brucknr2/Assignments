Abstract    :
                   In this renewal, PIs will, in collaboration with Mexican                  
              colleagues, finish work on an interdisciplinary study of an early              
              Jurassic assemblage of small fossil vertebrates from Huizachal                 
              Canyon, NE Mexico.  These fossils represent a rare example of the              
              apparently cosmopolitan, low-diversity fauna distributed throughout            
              most of Pangaea after the end-Triassic extinction.  Three lines of             
              research to be completed are 1) study some newly discovered                    
              fossils, including skulls of a new sphenodontian, 2) collect and               
              analyze pollen from appropriate localities, and 3) extend the                  
              stratigraphy into neighboring canyons to establish                             
              lithostratigraphic relationships of the fossil-bearing beds. Some              
              additional geochemical analyses and radiometric dating will be                 
              conducted to help establish the age of these fossil-bearing strata.
