Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The unconventional nature of superconductivity in the heavy                    
              electron superconductors (UPt3, URu2Si2, UPd2A13 etc.) will be                 
              explored via ultrasound, magnetic and electromagnetic measurements.            
              The dependence of the phase diagrams in these superconductors on               
              uniaxial strain, magnetic field and impurities will be mapped using            
              ultrasonics.  The results will be compared with predictions of                 
              Ginzburg Landau theories to place constraints on the multicomponent            
              order parameters.  Vortex states in these multiple phases will be              
              studied using low temperature scanning microscopy techniques.                  
              Initial experiments will be carried out with a magnetic force                  
              microscope which we have partially developed.  Finally, we propose             
              to study the novel response of these superconductors to                        
              electromagnetic waves.  The unusual frequency dependence to arise              
              in these superconductors will be studied up to frequencies of 2GHz.            
                                                                                             
              %%%                                                                            
                                                                                             
              Heavy-fermion materials show extraordinary electronic properties,              
              some exhibit superconductivity.  Measurements on thin films should             
              give valuable insights into the behavior of these highly unusual               
              materials.
