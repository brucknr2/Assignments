Abstract    :
              Theoretical research will be conducted on the electronic properties            
              of organic conductors.  Three areas of emphasis will include: (i)              
              dynamics of spin density waves including the effect of the long                
              range Coulomb potential; (ii) anomalous quantum oscillations in                
              organic conductors (Lebed resonances); and, (iii) unconventional               
              superconductors having relevance to superconductivity in organic               
              conductors and heavy fermions.

              Theoretical research will be conducted on the properties of organic            
              conductors.  These are highly unusual materials which normally are             
              not conductors of electricity.  However, under certain                         
              circumstances and in certain materials, this class of materials                
              exhibit a spectrum of unusual properties including                             
              superconductivity.  This research has ramifications for a variety              
              of issues in contemporary materials science and condensed matter               
              physics.
