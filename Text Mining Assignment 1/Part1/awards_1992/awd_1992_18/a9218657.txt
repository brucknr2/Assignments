Abstract    :
                   The bamboos (family Poaceae: Bambusoideae), which include the             
              true bamboos and rices, are a morphologically and ecologically                 
              diverse group of temperate and tropical grasses that comprise                  
              approximately 116 genera and 1300 species.  The rices, an important            
              cereal crop, have been extensively studied, but the true bamboos               
              (both woody and herbaceous) are much less well known taxonomically,            
              and large gaps in our knowledge of bamboos remain.  Evolutionary               
              relationships among the groups of bamboos, and between bamboos and             
              other grasses, have been only superficially explored.  With                    
              combined expertise in morphological and molecular techniques, Drs.             
              Clark and Wendel of Iowa State University are studying the                     
              taxonomic diversity of bamboos on a worldwide basis.  The primary              
              goals of their research are: 1. to produce an explicit and robust              
              phylogenetic hypothesis of bamboo evolution using a combined                   
              approach to integrate morphological and genomic data with modern               
              cladistic methods, and 2. to generate a classification of the                  
              bamboos at the tribal and generic levels that will ally related                
              groups of species into monophyletic groups (all those likely                   
              sharing a recent common ancestor).  Morphological studies will                 
              include new investigations by scanning electron microscopy of leaf             
              and seed surface features.  Molecular studies will include analyses            
              of patterns of restriction-enzyme digests of chloroplast DNA.                  
              Collaborators from around the world are supplying samples from the             
              numerous genera of bamboos.  The research promises the first global            
              perspective on bamboo evolution uniting morphological and genomic              
              data, and will facilitate subsequent taxonomic and biogeographic               
              studies of bamboos and their close relatives.
