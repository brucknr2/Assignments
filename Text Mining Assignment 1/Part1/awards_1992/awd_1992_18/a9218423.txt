Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This research explores the effects of absorbed hydrogen atoms on               
              phase changes in metal alloys.  Dissolved hydrogen appears to                  
              enhance metal atom mobility and allows phase separation not                    
              normally observed at lower temperatures.  Hydrogen-induced lattice             
              mobility, (HILM) is, therefore, the subject of this program.  Using            
              the palladium-rhodium alloy system as a model, phase boundary                  
              compositions are determined as a function of hydrogen content.                 
              Hydrogen is introduced under high pressures (up to 2000                        
              atmospheres).  Phase segregation studies incorporating HILM are                
              extended to the palladium-platinum and nickel-copper alloy systems.            
              HILM-induced ordering of intermetallic phases is examined in                   
              selected intermetallics in these alloy systems.  Analytical                    
              techniques such as electron microprobe analysis and scanning                   
              transmission electron microscopy are employed to characterize the              
              phases and related changes that occur.  Mechanisms of HILM are                 
              considered based on the experimental data developed.                           
              %%%                                                                            
              Results from this research should clarify how HILM can be used                 
              effectively in such areas as phase diagram determination, materials            
              synthesis, and micro-alloying.
