Abstract    :
                   This award provides one-half of the funding required for the              
              support of a laboratory technician to assist in the operations of              
              the stable isotope mass spectrometry laboratory in the Department              
              of Geological Sciences at the University of Southern California.               
              The University is committed to providing the remaining funding                 
              required.                                                                      
                   The stable isotope laboratory at USC is primarily engaged in              
              research projects investigating the role of aqueous fluids in                  
              geological processes of the Earth's crust. Specific goals of                   
              current projects include: (1) To determine the depth to which                  
              surface (meteoric) water penetrates the crust. (2) The nature of               
              fluid-rock interactions across the lithostatic-hydrostatic                     
              transition zone. (3) The role of fluids in faulting and shear                  
              zones. (4) Understanding the influence of fluids escaping from                 
              cooling magmatic plutons within the crust. These general goals are             
              investigated through detailed study of isotope variations                      
              (primarily oxygen, carbon, hydrogen, and sulfur) in rocks  of the              
              Mojave desert of California and Arizona.
