Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Dr Meinke has isolated over 200 embryonic mutants of Arabidopsis               
              thaliana with a wide range of developmental abnormalities. He has              
              been mapping genes with essential functions during embryogenesis               
              and an analyzing of T-DNA insertional mutants produced following               
              seed transformation. The proposed research will continue a                     
              molecular analysis of tagged embryonic mutants and examine                     
              several untagged mutants with particularly unusual phenotypes.                 
              The molecular analysis will focus on four mutants in which                     
              flanking sequences have already been recovered. Detailed analysis              
              will be limited to mutant genes with interesting patterns of                   
              expression, sequence homology to known genes, or transcripts that              
              can be recovered from existing cDNA libraries. Dr. Meinke has                  
              recently identified a novel homeotic mutant that appears to be                 
              defective in a regulatory gene that functions to activate a wide               
              range of embryo specific pathways. Mutant embryos are abnormal,                
              occasionally viviparous, and desiccation intolerant, but can be                
              rescued in culture prior to desiccation. The resulting seedlings               
              have a phenotype consistent with a model that mutant cotyledons                
              are partially transformed into leaves, and that this regulatory                
              gene functions to maintain the distinction between leaves and                  
              cotyledons. This mutant is not tagged, but merits detailed                     
              analysis and Dr. Meinke proposes to map the gene in preparation                
              to further characterization of this interesting mutant.
