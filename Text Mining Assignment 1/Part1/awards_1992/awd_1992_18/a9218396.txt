Abstract    :
                   Research in theoretical physics will encompass a broad                    
              program of studies, including elementary particle physics,                     
              nuclear physics, general relativity and cosmology.                             
              Phenomenological Studies will extract the fullest possible                     
              implications of data collected from existing experiments and                   
              those anticipated in the near future.  Such work is essential                  
              in testing the validity of currently accepted ideas, such as                   
              the Standard Model of elementary particles, and weeding out                    
              alternative schemes which attempt to supplant them.  A focus                   
              will be on the low-energy elementary particle phenomena, which                 
              are somewhat difficult to interpret theoretically.                             
              Theoretical Studies will involve the formulation of new                        
              theories, and will also deepen our knowledge of existing                       
              theories such as General Relativity, whose content has not yet                 
              been explored fully.  Finally, Educational Studies will serve                  
              to explain our science in clearly understandable terms to its                  
              practitioners and to students.  Such contributions will take                   
              the form of both books and pedagogic articles.
