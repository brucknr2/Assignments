Abstract    :
                   High density (HD) bands mark annual cycles of growth in X-                
              radiographs of reef coral skeletons and presumably form due to                 
              physiological response to seasonal cycles of temperature and light.            
              However, the mechanism of formation has not been established for               
              any coral.  The HD band is usually used to define the annual band,             
              and thus understanding its formation, and the controls on                      
              variability in its timing is important.  In the research, a                    
              conceptual model of how density bands form, based on physiological             
              and morphological data obtained with earlier NSF funding, is will              
              be developed.  Four specific aspects of the work will include:  (1)            
              development of a mechanistic mathematical model for the formation              
              of the HD band of Montastrea annularis, a major coral used in                  
              paleoclimate work; (2) conducting an in situ experiment to test the            
              validity of the model;  (3) evaluation of the genetic vs.                      
              environmental components of variation in time of formation of the              
              HD band; and (4) assessment of the variation among corals in the               
              relationship between HD bands and stable isotope profiles.  This               
              study will provide the type of environmental physiological data                
              needed for the precise use of coral density bands for                          
              paleoclimatology.
