Abstract    :
                   This is a project to combine laboratory experiments and                   
              numerical calculations to investigate the dynamical interaction of             
              melts and solids in the Earth's core and mantle.  The PI will carry            
              out laboratory experiments on thermochemical convection with                   
              crystallization in a rotating, electrically conducting fluid with              
              a co-rotating toroidal magnetic field, and apply the results to                
              dynamics in the Earth's core.  These experiments will exploit the              
              unique properties of gallium alloys as laboratory fluids for                   
              modeling melt-solid interactions in the core.
