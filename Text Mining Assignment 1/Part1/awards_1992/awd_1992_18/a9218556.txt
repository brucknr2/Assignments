Abstract    :
                   Inversion of surface displacement and strain data allow one               
              to estimate the geometry of the dislocation of slip on that                    
              surface.  The PI will improve geodetic inversions by: (1) computing            
              more accurate Green's functions, incorporating effects of elastic              
              heterogeneity, and (2) simultaneously inverting for the geometry               
              of the dislocation surface and the spatially varying slip, allowing            
              for correlations amongst these parameters.
