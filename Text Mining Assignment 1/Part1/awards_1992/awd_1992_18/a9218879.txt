Abstract    :
              The P.I.s to study the 10- to 5-Ma segment of silicic                          
              volcanism along the High Lava Plains.  The first stage, the                    
              subject of this project, is a comprehensive mapping and high-                  
              precision 40Ar-39Ar dating study, supplemented by                              
              reconnaissance geochemical analyses of mainly the silicic                      
              volcanic rocks.  A later stage will be aimed at the                            
              petrologic evolution of the silicic volcanic rocks, as                         
              warranted. The principle aims are:  (1) to examine in detail                   
              the regional northwestward age progression of silicic                          
              volcanism, and to investigate whether age-progressive trends                   
              within silicic centers mimic the regional trend; and (2) to                    
              evaluate the composition of the silicic volcanic rocks as a                    
              function of space and time by geochemical analyses of date                     
              and (or) stratigraphically controlled samples.  This will                      
              provide an unique series of time-composition slices through                    
              the evolution of a silicic volcanic province and will be a                     
              foundation for comparison to silicic volcanism along the                       
              Snake River-Yellowstone trend.
