Abstract    :
              The origin of the magnetic fields on the Sun and other cool stars              
              remains an important but poorly understood phenomenon in                       
              astrophysics.  Since magnetic activity has been shown to change the            
              sun's luminosity and ultraviolet flux, it may have significant                 
              effects on the terrestrial environment.  The PI has developed a                
              numerical method of studying the emergence of magnetic flux tubes              
              from their supposed place of origin at the base of the convective              
              zone to the surface of the Sun.  He will now explore the effects of            
              varying the magnetic field, the total flux and the initial location            
              of the flux.  Differential rotation and radiative diffusion will be            
              studied.  Flux emergence on other cool stars will be explored.
