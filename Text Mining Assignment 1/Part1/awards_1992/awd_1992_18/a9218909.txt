Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Three independent mechanisms of cell-cell adhesion function during             
              development of Dictyostelium discoideum. The early adhesion system             
              is mediated by a small protein, gp24, that first appears on the                
              surface of cells several hours after initiation of development and             
              preferentially accumulates in prestalk cells. There are three                  
              closely linked genes, csbA, csbB, and csbC, encoding gp24 that                 
              appear to be functionally redundant. Transformed cell lines in                 
              which one or two of these genes are deleted show alterations in                
              early adhesion. Moreover, cells lacking csbC culminate only after              
              a considerable delay and form gnarled fruiting bodies. Dr. Loomis              
              will use homologous recombination to replace all three csb loci                
              with a transformation vector carrying the pyr5-6 gene. The                     
              phenotype of the resulting strains will be analyzed in detail to               
              determine the consequences to cell-cell adhesion and subsequent                
              development. He will genetically rescue these triple deletion                  
              strains by transformation with a wild-type copy of one or more of              
              the csb genes and then explore the molecular mechanism of adhesion             
              by determining the functionality of variants generated by site                 
              specific mutagenesis. Using Restriction Enzyme Mediated Integration            
              (REMI) to tag developmentally important genes, he will isolate and             
              characterize other genes essential for cell-cell adhesion during               
              early development.
