Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This three-year award supports U.S.-France cooperative research                
              in ecology between Doyle B. McKey, University of Miami, and                    
              Finn Kjellberg, at the Center for Ecology and Evolutionary                     
              Ecology, Montpellier, France.  The objective is to study                       
              interactions in one of the classic cases of insect-plant coevolution:          
              figs and pollinating wasps. For fig/wasp mutualism to persist, the             
              pollinator wasps require flowering trees year-round as in tropical             
              environments. The investigators address fig/wasp mutualism in                  
              potentially destabilizing seasonal environments as in more                     
              northern, subtropical climes found in Florida and mediterranean                
              France.  They will conduct parallel experiments to characterize                
              wasp response to phenology, receptivity of individual figs and                 
              wasp behavior and chemical attraction to figs.                                 
                                                                                             
              The collaborative arrangements enable the investigators to pool                
              complementary expertise and obtain comparable results.  Both                   
              Miami and Montpellier are ideal locations to investigate the                   
              responses of fig/wasp mutualism to seasonal constraints.                       
              Because fig/wasp mutualism is a model system for studying many                 
              questions about co-evolution, the results from this study will                 
              make a major contribution to co-evolutionary studies in general.
