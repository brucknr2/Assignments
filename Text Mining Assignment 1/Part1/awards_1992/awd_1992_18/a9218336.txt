Abstract    :
              This award is for support of a study to perform in-situ deformation            
              experiments on pollycrystalline freshwater ice using synchrotron-              
              based transmission Laue technique using x-ray beam-line X-19C on               
              the synchrotron at Brookhaven National Laboratory.  The work will              
              examine the conditions under which slip can be transmitted across              
              grain boundaries in ice; dislocation pile-up formation and                     
              relaxation; whether grain boundaries can act as disloction sources             
              for non-basal slip; creep and sub-boundary formation; grain                    
              boundary sliding and grain boundary faceting.  The results of these            
              experiments will be relevant to understanding the fundamental                  
              mechanisms governing both texture formation in ice and the flow of             
              glaciers.
