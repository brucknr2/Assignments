Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Numerical solutions to the problem of salt water intrusion have                
              traditionally been validated by attempting to reproduce previous               
              numerical and analytical solutions.  In recent years, our ability              
              to solve the governing equations accurately has improved                       
              dramatically due to superior numerical algorithms and the                      
              widespread availability of computational resources.  Yet no recent             
              studies have examined the accuracy of salt water intrusion models              
              by comparison of sand box model studies with numerical solutions               
              to the problem.  Furthermore, there are some fundamental problems              
              with current salt water intrusion models related to the underlying             
              dispersion and diffusion mechanisms which couple the fluid flow                
              equation to the solute transport equation.                                     
              In this study, we propose to compare the results of sand box model             
              experiments with numerical models of the same problem in order to              
              evaluate the accuracy of the standard mathematical model for salt              
              water intrusion and to develop new mathematical models of the                  
              saltwater intrusion process which better describe the physics and              
              chemistry of the density-coupled flow and transport process.  The              
              sand box model experiments will serve as a new and unique data set             
              with which to verify the correctness of the new approach and to                
              validate numerical models of salt water intrusion.
