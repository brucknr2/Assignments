Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This award supports the participation of ten U.S. scientists in a              
              U.S.-Japan Seminar on Molecular and Microscale Transport                       
              Phenomema, to be held July 25-28, 1993 in Kanazawa, Japan.  The                
              co-organizers are Professor Chang-Lin Tien of the University of                
              California, Berkeley, and Professor Susumu Kotake of the                       
              University of Tokyo.  The objective of the seminar is to provide               
              an interdisciplinary and international forum for discussion of                 
              the latest results in a frontier area of transport phenomena                   
              research, which has importance to future developments in                       
              electronics manufacturing and microelectronic design.  Technical               
              session topics include:  highly-nonequilibrium transport,                      
              physico-chemical mechanisms, molecular interactions, quantum                   
              mechanics of transport, and interfacial phenomena.
