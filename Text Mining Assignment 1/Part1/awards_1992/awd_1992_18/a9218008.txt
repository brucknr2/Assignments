Abstract    :
              Research on stars which show surface activity analogous to the                 
              solar chromosphere will be continued using instrumentation                     
              developed at Pennsylvania State University.  Types of stars to be              
              studied include BY Dra stars, RS CVn stars, weak-lined T Tau stars             
              and classical T Tau stars.  An archive of about two thousand                   
              spectra has been built up over a period of years and will be                   
              exploited in this research along with new data to be acquired.  New            
              instrumentation is also planned for infrared observations with the             
              goal of measuring magnetic fields in stars.
