Abstract    :
              This award is for support of a one-year funded extension of a                  
              previous grant (of the same title) to Dr. MacAyeal (DPP-8914398) to            
              complete a research agenda that has grown in scope as a result of              
              new modeling techniques, and in anticipation of new deep ice coring            
              projects in West Antarctica.  The current project has already                  
              achieved a number of successes in ways which are important toward              
              reaching the overall goal of predicting the West Antarctic ice                 
              sheet's response to global warming.  This work will help to predict            
              ice core attributes such as chronology, levels of clathrate                    
              stability, isotopic and thermal stratigraphy, among other                      
              parameters, which will be useful in the interpretation of ice cores            
              to be obtained in West Antarctica.
