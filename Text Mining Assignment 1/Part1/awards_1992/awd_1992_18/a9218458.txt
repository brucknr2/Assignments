Abstract    :
              The principal objective of this research project is to                         
              understand isotopic resetting processes for the U-Pb and Sm-                   
              Nd systems in minerals in the contact aureole of the Laramie                   
              Anorthosite Complex.  The time-temperature profile of the                      
              aureole will be refined using conventional phase equilibria,                   
              oxygen isotope thermometry and Ar-Ar biotite and hornblende                    
              cooling ages.  The resulting profile will then be used to                      
              place constraints on the closure temperatures and resetting                    
              processes for the U-Pb and Sm-Nd systematics in minerals                       
              such as ilmenite, sphene, apatite, garnet and monazite.                        
              Comparison of the temperatures at which the U-Pb and Sm-Nd                     
              ages reset in minerals from reactive and non-reactive rock                     
              types in the aureole will permit examination of the effects                    
              of mineral reactions and volume diffusion on reequilibration                   
              of the various isotopic sytems.
