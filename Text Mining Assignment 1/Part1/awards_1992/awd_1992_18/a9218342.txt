Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This award supports a two-year collaborative research project                  
              betweeen Professor Steven M. George of the University of Colorado              
              and Professor Masataka Hirose of Hiroshima University, Hiroshima,              
              Japan.  The research involves the study of reaction kinetics on                
              semiconductor surfaces to develop silicon atomic layer                         
              processing.  Professor Hirose focuses on the physics and                       
              chemistry in ultra large scale integration (ULSI) process                      
              technology.  The atomic layer control of silicon processing is a               
              critical need for ULSI device fabrication.  The control of                     
              monolayer processing requires an understanding of surface                      
              kinetics.                                                                      
                                                                                             
              This collaborative project will bring together the background and              
              expertise of the two research groups in surface kinetics and                   
              device fabrication.  The project also mixes the disciplines of                 
              chemistry and electrical engineering.  The PI will visit                       
              Professor Hirose's laboratory twice, each time taking a graduate               
              student with him for an extended period.  Professor Hirose and                 
              his colleagues will also visit the University of Colorado.
