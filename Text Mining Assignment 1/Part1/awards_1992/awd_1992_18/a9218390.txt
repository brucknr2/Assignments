Abstract    :
              9218390  Anderson         The PI will study continental lithosphere and hotspots
              to  determine correlations from the present to at least Pangea times.   Spatial
              and spectral techniques will be used to find, describe and  understand
              relationships between seismic velocity anomalies, on a  global basis, and
              hotspots, ridges, rifts, massive volcanism,      thick lithosphere and present
              and past plate and slab positions.   The projects all involve new tomographic
              results and are guaranteed  to bring new insights from the seismological
              perspective alone, by  combining available observations from other fields.  The
              mantle has  a long memory and tomography provides much more than just an 
              instantaneous snapshot of conditions in the interior.  ***
