Abstract    :
              The Principal Investigator (PI)                                                
              proposes to develop a new technique                                            
              to unfold wrongly folded proteins                                              
              and to refold them to their native                                             
              and active conformations.  The                                                 
              technique involves the formation of                                            
              clathrate hydrates in                                                          
              protein-containing solutions with                                              
              low concentrations of denaturants.                                             
              Hydrate formation in such solutions                                            
              opens up the possibility of an                                                 
              in-situ control of denaturant                                                  
              concentration by converting part of                                            
              the aqueous phase to a solid                                                   
              crystalline form.  The desired                                                 
              objective is to unfold proteins by                                             
              forming hydrates and thus                                                      
              increasing denaturant levels, and                                              
              subsequently refold these proteins                                             
              correctly by dissociating hydrates                                             
              and thus reducing denaturant                                                   
              levels.  This research is                                                      
              exploratory in its nature, and is                                              
              based on a well-known technology                                               
              directed towards a completely new                                              
              application.
