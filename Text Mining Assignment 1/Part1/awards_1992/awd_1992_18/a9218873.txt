Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Investigations of Star Clusters.                                               
                                                                                             
              Star cluster research at Yerkes Observatory primarily involves                 
              astrometric (proper motions) and photometric studies of globular               
              clusters, dwarf spheroidal galaxies, and a few open clusters.                  
              Proper motions are used to derive cluster membership, study the                
              internal dynamics of the nearer clusters, and derive space                     
              velocities.  High quality photometry is normally obtained along                
              with the astrometry to produce very clean color-magnitude diagrams.            
              In some globular clusters the proper motions are combined with                 
              radial velocities obtained by Dr. Cudworth and others to further               
              constrain dynamical models and to derive distances with sufficient             
              precision to provide a useful new calibration of the globular                  
              cluster distance scale independent of "standard candle"                        
              assumptions.  Absolute proper motions and hence space velocities               
              are being determined for globulars and some dwarf spheroidal                   
              galaxies.  With an emphasis on space velocity derivations for very             
              distant globulars and dwarf speroidals, Dr. Cudworth will be able              
              to place better constrains on the mass of the Milky Way.
