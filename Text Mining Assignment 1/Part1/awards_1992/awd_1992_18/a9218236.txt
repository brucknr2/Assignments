Abstract    :
                 This project is concerned with international travel support to              
              a planning workshop on "Universals n the Lexicon", to be held in               
              Schlos Dagstuhl of Germany.  The objective of this workshop is to              
              examine the intersection of computational linguistics,                         
              computational lexicography, text corpora, knowledge representation,            
              lexical semantics, and natural language processing.  Lexicon                   
              research plays a pivotal role in electronic library, machine                   
              translation, natural language understanding, and knowledge                     
              processing.  An intensive discussion among experts in various                  
              relevant techniques is essential to the advance of these fields.               
              This workshop will bring about significant understandings in both              
              theoretical and practical aspects of lexicon research and its                  
              impact on electronic library, machine translation, natural language            
              understanding, and knowledge processing.//
