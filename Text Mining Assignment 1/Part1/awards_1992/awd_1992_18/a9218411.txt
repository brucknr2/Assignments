Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                                                                                            
              The mechanistic aspects of the oxidation of dissolved organic                  
              carbon (DOC) in high temperature combustion (HTC) carbon analyzers             
              are largely unknown.  For example, it is not known whether 02(g) is            
              needed to oxidize DOC, whether "catalysts" are needed at all, or               
              whether carbonaceous impurities in catalysts contribute                        
              significantly to system blanks.  Until the situation changes, HTC              
              analyzers will continue to be designed and used in an empirical                
              manner.  This research will test the hypothesis that oxidation of              
              DOC in HTC instruments is largely due, in a mechanistic sense, to              
              the reaction of DOC with hydroxyl radicals (OH) and other reactive             
              species that are generated by thermal homolysis of injected H20.               
              This hypothesis is amenable to direct experimental investigation.              
              A commercial HTC carbon analyzer will be modified extensively and              
              interfaced with several specialized instruments (e.g. gas                      
              chromatograph; gas chromatograph-mass spectrometer) that are used              
              to quantify major and minor gaseous species that may form during               
              analysis of a DOC sample.  The compositions of carrier gases and               
              catalysts will be varied systematically to clearly resolve the                 
              roles of 02(g) and OH in the oxidation process.  Temperature-                  
              programmed volatization/combustion will be evaluated as a means of             
              measuring inorganic carbon, volatile organic carbon, and non-                  
              volatile organic carbon.  A new generation, mechanistically based              
              HTC carbon analyzer will be designed and tested.
