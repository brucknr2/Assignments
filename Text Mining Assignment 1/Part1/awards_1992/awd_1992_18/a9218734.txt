Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The primary objective of this research is to examine the effects of            
              pregnancy loss on birthspacing patterns in women of Matlab Thana,              
              Bangladesh.  Special attention will be paid to how the risk of                 
              pregnancy loss varies among women, the effects of maternal age on              
              the risk of loss, and the stage of gestation at which loss occurs.             
              A sample of 375 women will be monitored over an eleven-month                   
              period, and urine samples will be collected from them twice a week.            
              The study will use new, highly sensitive assays of urinary                     
              chorionic gonadotropin, which allow detection of pregnancy within              
              a few days of conception.  These assays will permit the first                  
              community-wide study of early pregnancy loss ever to be conducted.             
              It is necessary to carry out this research in a developing country             
              because, in western women, the relevant patterns are obscured by               
              family planning.  This research is of theoretical importance in                
              elucidating the factors that determine reproductive rates under                
              conditions of natural fertility.  It is also of clinical importance            
              in developing methods for the identification of women at high risk             
              of pregnancy loss, and in counseling older women who wish to become            
              pregnant.
