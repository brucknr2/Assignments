Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The goal of this research is to characterize a series of silver                
              halide chalcogenide compounds for the purpose of deducing transport            
              mechanisms from the patterns and trends observed.  The effect of               
              chemical substitution on ionic motion also is examined.  Several               
              solid mixtures are prepared by mixing silver halides and silver                
              chalcogenides.  Techniques such as x-ray diffraction, calorimetry,             
              and electrical conductivity are used to characterize the prepared              
              solid mixtures.                                                                
                                                                                             
              Solid-state electrolytes are being investigated for their potential            
              use in high-power, light-weight batteries.  Among the array of                 
              possible electrolytic materials, those containing silver typically             
              are found to be good conductors, and thus they are of interest as              
              potential battery electrolytes.  In this work, fast ion conductors             
              are prepared from silver halides and silver calcogenides.  In a                
              systematic survey, crystal structure, thermal properties, and                  
              electrical properties of the cited class of ionic materials are                
              determined to access their suitability for eventual use in                     
              batteries.
