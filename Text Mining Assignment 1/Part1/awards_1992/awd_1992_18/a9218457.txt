Abstract    :
              This US-Argentina Cooperative Science award                                    
              will support the collaboration of Eileen                                       
              Johnson of Texas Tech University and Gustavo                                   
              Politis of the National University of La Plata,                                
              Argentina.  The project aims to explore the                                    
              taphonomy, technology, and paleoecology of                                     
              early Pampean sites, in an assessment of                                       
              whether there is evidence that Early Man kill-                                 
              sites occur in South America.                                                  
                                                                                             
              In the last 20 years, late Pleistocene and                                     
              early Holocene Early Man sites have been                                       
              discovered on the Pampas.  These sites are                                     
              critical to understanding the early peopling of                                
              Argentina and South America.  This project will                                
              conduct bone studies aimed at delineating                                      
              formation and disturbance processes at the                                     
              sites, the subsistence base and social                                         
              structure of the hunter-gatherers occupying                                    
              these early sites, the use of bone as a                                        
              resource, and the environmental and climatic                                   
              setting of these early occupations.  The                                       
              researchers will analyze bone material from                                    
              four sites in Argentina, which will provide a                                  
              broad view of the range of variation in                                        
              activities, topographic settings, space, and                                   
              time.  The Argentine side will contribute                                      
              access to the research sites, expertise in                                     
              local archaeology, and laboratory facilities.                                  
              The US side will contribute its expertise in US                                
              grasslands models and training for several                                     
              Argentine students, including one who will                                     
              spend a half-year in Johnson's lab.
