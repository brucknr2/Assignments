Abstract    :
              9218960  Elmore         The research is to test mechanisms of remagnetization,
              with  the particular focus on the role of orogenic-basinal fluids.   Chemical
              remagnetizations are common in sedimentary rocks and  diagenetic processes
              triggered by orogenic fluids.  Comparison of  paleomagnetic and rock magnetic
              results with geochemical  characteristics, deformation patterns, and burial
              histories will  allow for tests of chemical (both basinal fluids and in situ 
              processes), strain-related, and thermoviscous mechanisms.  ***
