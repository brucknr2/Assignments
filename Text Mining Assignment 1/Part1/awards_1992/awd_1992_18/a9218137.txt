This award supports the dissertation research of a
              cultural anthropologist from the University of Virginia.  The project analyzes
              the production and representation of social and cultural distinctions in the
              interaction of backwards ethnic groups known as Bai in western Yunnan, China. 
              The student will conduct participant observation and study life histories in 
              rural communities, as well as study rural popular theater groups, regional
              festivals, and representations of the archaeological past in local museums, to
              understand how the local ethnic groups relate to the state.   The theoretical
              issues to be studied are how  local ethnic groups resist national-state
              domination at the same time that they use state institutions to protect their
              political and cultural rights.
      At a time when the world seems to be
              erupting in ethnic violence vis-a-vis weakened national states (e.g., USSR,
              Yugoslavia) we need to understand how local groups accept and reject different
              forms of national hegemony.  This sort of case study will provide valuable
              comparative information towards this theoretical goal.
