Abstract    :
              Massive stars end their lives in violent explosions known as                   
              supernovae.  Based on observations there are several types of                  
              supernovae but there remain questions about which stars produce                
              which type of supernova.  Many of the details of the explosions are            
              still not well understood.  Improved light curve and spectral                  
              calculations for types Ia, Ib and Ic supernovae and the nebular                
              phase of SN 1987A will be made.   Degenerate carbon ignition is                
              thought to be the cause of one type of supernova and this will be              
              modelled for comparison with observation.  The observation of super            
              novae from McDonald Observatory and studies of the rates of                    
              supernovae of various types will also be undertaken.
