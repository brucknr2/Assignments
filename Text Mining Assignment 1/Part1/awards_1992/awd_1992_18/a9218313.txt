Abstract    :
              Three separate tasks are planned.  The first is an isotopic                    
              investigation of separated mineral phases from "ultradeep"                     
              ultramafic xenoliths from kimberlites.  The second task is a                   
              geochemical and isotopic study of ultramafic xenoliths from                    
              several oceanic islands.  The third task will be the major                     
              focus of our work.  It entails development of laboratory                       
              capabilities for measuring 238U and 232Th isotopes by mass                     
              spectrometry, and will concentrate on the measurement of                       
              226Ra in both whole-rock and separated phenocryst phases.                      
              The goal of his work is to gain a better understanding of                      
              the timescales and nature of magmatic fractionation                            
              processes, magma transport, and the origin of the ubiquitous                   
              226Ra excesses in volcanic rocks from a variety of tectonic                    
              settings.
