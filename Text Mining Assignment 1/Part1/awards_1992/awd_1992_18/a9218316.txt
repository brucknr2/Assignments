Abstract    :
                   The objective of this research is to better understand how                
              midlatitude cyclones or storms develop.  The principal investigator            
              will examine a number of cyclogenetic processes in the                         
              extratropical atmosphere, focusing on the formation of so-called               
              "short waves" in the upper troposphere, in a series of case                    
              studies.  The study will employ high resolution analyses in                    
              isentropic coordinates, using the technique of potential vorticity             
              inversion.                                                                     
                   Much previous research on cyclogenesis has dealt with the                 
              process after the initial upper-level shortwaves are evident.  In              
              this project, the PI will attempt to identify the origin of those              
              shortwaves.
