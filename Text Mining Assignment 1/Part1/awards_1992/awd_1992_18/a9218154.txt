Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This award supports the participation of ten U.S. scientists in a              
              U.S.-Japan Seminar on Classical and Molecular Cytogenetic                      
              Analysis of Cereal Genomes, which will be held in March 8-10,                  
              1994 in Manhattan, Kansas.  The co-organizers are Professor                    
              Bikram S. Gill, Kansas State University, and Professor Koichiro                
              Tsunewaki, Kyoto University.  The major objective of the seminar               
              is to bring together researchers, particularly younger                         
              researchers at the Assistant or Associate Professor level, to                  
              discuss cereal genome structure and comparative genome mapping.                
              The participants, who are from classical and molecular areas,                  
              will discuss problems of common interest such as chromosome                    
              structure and function, nucleo-cytoplasmic interactions, and                   
              cytoplasmic male sterility.                                                    
                                                                                             
              This meeting will stimulate interaction among cereal geneticists,              
              cereal and non-cereal geneticists, and plant and mammalian                     
              cytogeneticists.  To arrive at common mechanisms underlying the                
              genome structure, evolution, and speciation in polyploid plants,               
              some scientists in polyploid plants are also invited.  The                     
              proceedings of the seminar will be published as a paperback and                
              widely distributed.
