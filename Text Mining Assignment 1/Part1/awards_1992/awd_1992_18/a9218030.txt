Abstract    :

              This award supports Dr. Olszewski's participation in a joint                   
              project with Dr. Mario Mateo of the Carnegie Institution.  These               
              researchers will identify and study Cepheids in star clusters in               
              the Magellanic Clouds.  These stars provide a fundamental data set             
              to fine tune the Cepheid distance scale, as well as pulsational and            
              stellar evolutionary theory.
