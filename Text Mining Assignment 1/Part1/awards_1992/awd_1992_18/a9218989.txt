Abstract    :
                   It is proposed to investigate scent production in Clarkia, a              
              genus of annual plants native to California.  Clarkia breweri is               
              the only species in the genus with scented flowers.  C. breweri                
              flowers are visited mostly by hawkmoths.  The odorless flowers of              
              C. concinna, a closely related species, are visited mostly by                  
              butterflies and flies, whereas all other outcrossing Clarkia                   
              species are pollinated by bees.  We have identified four major                 
              components of the scent of C. breweri flowers.  They are linalool,             
              linalool oxide, benzyl acetate, and methyl salicylate, all                     
              important ingredients in manufactured perfumes.  We propose to                 
              conduct a formal genetic study of the genes controlling the                    
              production of these compounds in C. breweri, and to use molecular              
              biological techniques to isolate the gene encoding the enzyme                  
              linalool synthase (LS) that catalyzed the synthesis of linalool.               
              The genetic changes underlying the ability of C. breweri to make               
              linalool, while its close relatives do not, will be examined.                  
              %%%                                                                            
              Flower scents have profound effects on the reproduction of plants              
              and are also important in many man-made products.  However, the                
              synthesis of flower scents has been scarcely investigated on the               
              genetic and molecular level and the results obtained from this work            
              will produce significant insights into this process.
