Abstract    :
                   The unicellular green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii                      
              differentiates into 4 distinct cell types during the course of its             
              life cycle.  Most if not all of these differentiation programs are             
              governed by its mating-type (mt) locus which exists as a pair of               
              apparent alleles (mt+ and mt-).  A chromosome walk has documented              
              that the mt loci include highly rearranged sectors which render mt+            
              and mt- very dissimilar to one another.  By analogy with fungal                
              mating-type loci this rearranged domain may include genes that                 
              govern life-cycle transitions.  One such gene has already been                 
              identified in the region:  the imp-1 gene, which confers upon mt+              
              gametes the ability to fuse with mt- gametes, has been localized to            
              a segment of the rearranged domain by virtue of its disruption in              
              imp-1 mutants.  Additional sequences from the rearranged domains               
              will be used to identify additional mt-linked genes, to identify               
              cDNA clones derived from cell-type-specific, mt-linked genes, and              
              to identify genes whose products regulate the mating phenotype of              
              gametic cells.                                                                 
              %%%                                                                            
              This analysis should enhance our understanding of the evolution of             
              eukaryotic gene regulation and cell differentiation.
