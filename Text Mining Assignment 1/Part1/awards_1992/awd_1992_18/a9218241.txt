Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This award supports a two-year collaborative research project                  
              between Professor Richard Boyd of Ohio State University and Dr.                
              Isao Tanihata of the Institute of Physical and Chemical Research               
              (RIKEN), Japan.  The project is designed to measure cross sections             
              using the radioactive beam facility at RIKEN, which are of interest            
              to predictions of primordial nucleosynthesis.  These predictions               
              are crucial in testing the veracity of such models.  The specific              
              cross sections to be measured are aimed at improving our                       
              understanding of the primordial nucleosynthesis of nuclides                    
              somewhat heavier than those usually discussed in this context, but             
              which are readily observable by astronomers, even at very low                  
              abundance levels.                                                              
                                                                                             
              Also involved in the project are Professor James Kolata of the                 
              University of Notre Dame, and two postdoctoral fellows and one                 
              graduate student in Dr. Boyd's laboratory.  All five scientists                
              will undertake visits to RIKEN to carry out the project.
