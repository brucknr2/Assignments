Abstract    :
              The infrared and bolometric luminosities of elliptical galaxies and            
              the bulges of spiral galaxies are dominated by light from K and M              
              giants.  The objective of this project is to determine the physical            
              characteristics of such stars of different ages and compositions               
              and in different environments.  This will be accomplished using                
              infrared spectroscopy and photometry supplemented by some optical              
              spectroscopy.  The implications include testing and calibrating                
              models of stellar interiors and evolution and information on the               
              stellar systems themselves.  The results will also be useful for               
              future investigations of the integrated light from stellar systems.
