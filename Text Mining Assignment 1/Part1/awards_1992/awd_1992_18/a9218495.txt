Abstract    :
              This award is for support of a one-year Small Grant for Exploratory            
              Research (SGER) to test an hypothesis that frazil ice and anchor               
              ice form in glacial meltwater flowing into subpolar marine water               
              and form deposits that may be distinguishable from deposits of                 
              temperate and polar glacial environments.  The proposed study to               
              search and document that frazil and anchor ice form at the termini             
              of glaciers and play a role in sediment transport is high risk, but            
              if successful, this study will have identified a significant new               
              mechanism of sediment dispersal, thus leading the way to an                    
              increased understanding of ice-front processes in the Antarctic.               
              The field-based study will consist of (1) video surveys with an ROV            
              submersible to detect frazil and anchor ice and to study the                   
              glacier terminus, (2) CTD profiles, water samples and sediment                 
              traps to study processes of dispersal and sedimentation, and 3)                
              bottom cores to document the record of these processes.
