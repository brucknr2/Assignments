Abstract    :
                   Evidence that large scale extension operates at the                       
              same time as overall compression during tectonic convergence                   
              has been observed in several orogens.  The extension is                        
              usually at high structural levels while compression is                         
              operating at depth, however the relative extent and                            
              displacements are not well understood.  This project                           
              continues, investigation of possible Mesozoic extension in                     
              the Bitterroot Mountains of  Idaho and Montana that occurred                   
              during the Sevier Orogen.  Prior results indicate that                         
              extension operated in the Funeral Mountains of California                      
              during this tectonic episode.  This work will help determine                   
              the regional extent and importance of this phenomena for the                   
              Sevier Orogen.  The results should be applicable to                            
              understanding the general significance of extension in                         
              compressional orogens.
