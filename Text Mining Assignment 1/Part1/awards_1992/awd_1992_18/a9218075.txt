Abstract    :
              Observational studies related to pulsars will be undertaken.  Pulse            
              timing and shape data will be used to study variations in the pulse            
              periods with the goal of separating various effects and                        
              ascertaining whether the presence of companions can be                         
              demonstrated.  Proper motion measurements will be made to place                
              constraints of formation processes and searches will be made for               
              new pulsars both in the radio and infrared spectral regions.  The              
              search may uncover a new class of pulsars.
