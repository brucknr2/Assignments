Abstract    :
                   The PI will continue research initiated under a grant to P.               
              Olson and J. Vanyo.  The research will explore secondary surface               
              flows and interior flows in the liquid core caused by luni-solar               
              precession of the mantle.  The experimental research will use                  
              liquids in an available oblate spheroidal cavity under simulated               
              liquid core conditions.  Thermal convection will be added to                   
              initiate a study of combined precession and buoyancy driven                    
              convective motions.  The PI will continue detail designs and                   
              planned operation of a later experiment using a more precise cavity            
              with 1/400 elliptocyte and additional internal flow measurements.
