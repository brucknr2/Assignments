Abstract    :

              This award supports Dr. Mateo's participation in a joint project               
              with Dr. Edward Olszewski of the University of Arizona.  These                 
              researchers will identify and study Cepheids in star clusters in               
              the Magellanic Clouds.  These stars provide a fundamental data set             
              to fine tune the Cepheid distance scale, as well as pulsational and            
              stellar evolutionary theory.
