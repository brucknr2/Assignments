Abstract    :
              The long term goal of this research is to understand supernova                 
              explosions and use that knowledge to determine the distances of                
              other galaxies.  These distances are basic to our efforts to                   
              understand the origin of the universe and determine its age.  The              
              approach is based on observations followed by close comparison of              
              the data to theoretical models.  As the research proceeds, such                
              questions as the rate of supernovae in our galaxy and other                    
              galaxies, the types of stars which become supernovae, the effects              
              of these explosions on the interstellar gas, the role of supernovae            
              in manufacturing heavy elements, the energy output of supernovae               
              and the properties of various types of supernovae will be                      
              addressed.   This work has been underway for more than a decade and            
              will continue under this grant.
