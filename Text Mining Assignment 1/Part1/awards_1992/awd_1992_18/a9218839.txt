Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The purpose of this project is to determine how signals from                   
              nerve cells control the degradation of cellular proteins in                    
              muscle. The experimental subject is a small roundworm,                         
              Caenorhabditis elegans, that has a relatively simple system of                 
              nerves and muscles. This organism is also conducive to simple and              
              rapid genetic experiments. To observe protein degradation, we                  
              have introduced  a foreign gene from a bacterium (E. coli) into                
              the worm so that the fate of this protein can be easily followed               
              by biochemical and immunochemical methods. Our objective is to                 
              use mutants that affect the function of nerves or muscles to                   
              determine how direct nerve-to-muscle connections and/or chemical               
              signaling between nerves and muscles affects the rate of protein               
              breakdown inside muscle cells.
