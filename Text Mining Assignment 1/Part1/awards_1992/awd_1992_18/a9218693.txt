Abstract    :
                This research will study three widely separated areas of the                 
              earth with a common thread of theoretical waveform modeling that               
              has been developed by earlier studies.  Seismic body waves will be             
              synthesized using approximate high frequency and hybrid                        
              approximate/finite difference techniques and compared to data                  
              waveforms to investigate characteristics from three zones: 1) the              
              thickness, mantle penetration, and stratification of descending                
              lithospheric slabs; 2) the heterospectrum of the lowermost D"                  
              region of the mantle and topography of the core-mantle boundary;               
              and 3) the lateral variation and anisotropy of the elastic and                 
              anelastic structure of the inner core.  The results of this                    
              research will include evidence for the existence or nature of slab             
              penetration below 650 km; a test of the origin of a high frequency             
              waveguide along the top of some slabs; a test of the applicability             
              of the Born approximation to the study of PKIKP precursors and the             
              importance of strong scattering within D"; and a test of an                    
              anelastic model of the inner core as an explanation for the                    
              observed amplitude, travel time, and frequency content for PKIKP.
