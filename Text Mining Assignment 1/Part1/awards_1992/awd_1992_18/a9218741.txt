Abstract    :
                   In a number of compressional orogens clognate tabular                     
              or sheet-like plutons are common, yet their tectonic                           
              significance or mechanism of emplacement is not well                           
              understood.  The crystalline core of the North Cascades                        
              (part of the Cretaceous Coast Plutonic Complex) are                            
              dominated by sheet-like plutons and their deformed wall                        
              rocks.  This project will evaluate the relationship between                    
              emplacement of these bodies and the regional tectonics in                      
              order to understand the links between magmatism and                            
              emplacement mechanisms.  Results should be applicable to                       
              several orogens in which sheet-like plutons also are an                        
              important part.
