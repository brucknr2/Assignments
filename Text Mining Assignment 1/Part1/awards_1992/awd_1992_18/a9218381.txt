Abstract    :
                   Extension along the continental margin of southwestern                    
              North America was in progress before the modern plate                          
              boundary in the Gulf of California became established.  This                   
              project will investigate these early extensional structures                    
              in an area of Baja California where Late Miocene to                            
              Quaternary volcanic and sedimentary rocks are well exposed                     
              and contain evidence of extension.  The work involves field                    
              mapping, magentostratigraphy and radiometric age dating, and                   
              will be done in association with Mexican colleagues.                           
              Results will be relevant to generic models of Gulf of                          
              California rift initiation and may be applicable to other                      
              rift systems in the geologic record.
