Abstract    :
              The fundamental crystal chemical behavior of REEs in minerals is               
              not well understood.  Among those minerals whose atomic                        
              arrangements are unknown or poorly characterized are the most                  
              common REE-bearing minerals, including 1) bastnaesite, the most                
              abundant REE-bearing ore mineral, and its associated REE                       
              fluorcarbonates; 2) the common REE (PO4) "dimorphs", moazite and               
              xenotime, and 3) high-Si monazite, of particular interest because              
              substituent Si may play an important role in controlling the REE               
              chemistry of monazites.  Preliminary to this submission an                     
              extensive effort has been undertaken to obtain high quality                    
              specimens of these minerals in order to undertake high-precision               
              crystal structure analysis of the phases.  Preliminary film                    
              studies attest to the high quality of the crystals and ultimately              
              assure success in the crystal structure studies.  The results of               
              these studies will help to elucidate the crystal chemical                      
              behavior of the REEs in the most common REE-bearing minerals.
