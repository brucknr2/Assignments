              This Science in Developing Countries award will                                
              support the travel of 14 U.S. participants in                                  
              the Seventh Latin American Symposium on Surface                                
              Physics (SLAFS-7), to be held in Bariloche,                                    
              Argentina, November 15-20, 1992.                                               
                                                                                             
              The Symposium aims to serve as a forum for an                                  
              exchange of information on current developments                                
              within the Americas in solid surfaces and                                      
              related fields; stimulate collaborative                                        
              research among researchers from Latin America,                                 
              the United States, Canada, and Europe; and                                     
              strengthen the scientific base of Latin                                        
              America.  Because research on both pure and                                    
              applied aspects of surface science is being                                    
              conducted in Latin America, and because surface                                
              physics overlaps with associated technology                                    
              areas, the Symposium will be held in                                           
              conjunction with the First Ibero-American                                      
              Congress on Surface Science and Applications.                                  
              Benefits to both U.S. and Latin American                                       
              participants include the development of future                                 
              North-South research ties.
