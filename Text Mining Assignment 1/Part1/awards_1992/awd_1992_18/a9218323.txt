Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This three-year award supports U.S.-France cooperative research                
              in applied mathematics.  The investigators are Irena Lasiecka                  
              and Roberto Triggiani from the University of Virginia and J.P.                 
              Zolesio and M. Souli from the University of Nice.  The                         
              investigators will utilize partial differential equations, hyperbolic          
              equations and numerical analysis in approaching a number of                    
              problems in structural mechanics.  The project focuses on elastic              
              structures whose dynamical behavior is effected by internal                    
              damping of vibrations.  The objectives are to enhance stability                
              properties by determining the optimal shape or design of the                   
              elastic structure so that undesirable vibrations are reduced.                  
                                                                                             
              The U.S. investigators bring to this collaboration their expertise             
              in mathematical modelling of structural damping, optimum                       
              control and related questions and the utilization of elastic partial           
              differential equations for determining controllability and                     
              stabilization properties.  This is complemented by French                      
              expertise in shape analysis and optimization.  The research has                
              important applications in the areas of space mechanics and                     
              control.
