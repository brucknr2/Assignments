Abstract    :
                This research continues a project on coupled free oscillations               
              and the large-scale lateral heterogeneity of the earth.  Specific              
              tasks to be done now are the modification and improvement of the               
              efficiency of the coupled-mode synthetic seismogram code, the                  
              increase of resolution of synthetic inversion studies of the                   
              structure of the earth, the study of surface-wave amplitude                    
              anomalies, and body waves in laterally homogeneous and laterally               
              heterogeneous earth models.  The theoretical and computer code                 
              results of this work will be widely applicable to studies of the               
              earth's structure, earthquakes, and tectonics.
