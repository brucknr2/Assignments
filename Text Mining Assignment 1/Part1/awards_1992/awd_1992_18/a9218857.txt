Abstract    :
              We propose to continue on several lines of research in which                   
              the laboratory is currently active, as follows:  (1)                           
              Experimental determinations of oxygen isotope equilibrium                      
              constants using silicate-carbonate exchange techniques.  (2)                   
              Oxygen isotope studies of eclogites.  (3) Isotopic studies                     
              of Brazilian carbonatites. (4) origin of crustal rocks as                      
              seen in the Kohistan batholith.  (5) Isotopic and trace-                       
              element studies of a natural analog of a nuclear waste                         
              repository.  (6) Oxygen and silicon isotope variations in                      
              primitive and differentiated meteorites; trace-element                         
              studies in primitive achondrites.  (7) Laboratory                              
              measurement of the kinetics of oxygen isotope exchange                         
              between gases and molten silicates for application to the                      
              origin of chondrules.  (8)  Investigation of H2O and CO2 in                    
              SNC meteorites for their relevance to planetary surface                        
              processes.
