Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  The object of this work is the measurement of lightning                   
              activity on a global scale through its excitation of the                       
              electromagnetic resonances of the global electrical circuit.  Local            
              measurements in the tropics have shown that lightning activity is              
              sensitively dependent on the wet bulb temperature of boundary layer            
              air.  The PIs propose to make detailed comparisons between Schumann            
              resonance amplitudes and the real distributions of wet bulb                    
              temperature and deep tropical convection.  Feedback effects of the             
              deep convection in the temperature distributions and subsequent                
              global lightning will be examined.  A new station in Peru will                 
              complement two existing ones in California and Western Australia.              
              Comparisons will be made with independent measurements of the                  
              ionospheric potential and observations of ionization of the                    
              ionosphere.  The project will include investigation of possible ELF            
              electromagnetic signatures of upward propagating cloud-ionosphere              
              discharges originating in Amazonian thunderstorms.  The practical              
              importance of this research lies in its potential for developing a             
              sensitive index of global change from easily obtainable ground-                
              based measurements of Schumann resonances.
