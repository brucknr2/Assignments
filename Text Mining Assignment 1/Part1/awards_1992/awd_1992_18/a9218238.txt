Abstract    :
              Pradhan         This research focuses on the development of a unified  framework
              for combining on-line and off-line error detection  mechanisms at both the chip
              and board levels.  This framework  includes: concurrent checking of the device
              for on-line  detection, space and time compression of test responses, analysis 
              of distortions in the resulting signatures for error detection  and diagnosis
              for built-in self testing (BIST), and concurrent  checking of hardware required
              for (BIST).
