Abstract    :
              The focus of this work is the development of synthetic routes                  
              towards the production of macrocyclic depsipeptides of plant                   
              origin.  Specific goals are the optimized syntheses of a number                
              of 14-membered cyclopeptide alkaloids containing                               
              beta-hydroxy-alpha-amino acids.  The targets are mauritine A,,                 
              sanjoinine A, integerrenine and hymenocardine.  The structural                 
              issues of conformation and metal-complexation in these natural                 
              products will be addressed also.

              With this award, the Synthetic Organic Program is supporting                   
              the research of Dr. Madeleine M. Joullie of the Department of                  
              Chemistry at the University of Pennsylvania.  Professor Joullie                
              will focus her work on the synthesis of a class of natural                     
              products known as cyclopeptide alkaloids.  The difficulty in                   
              isolating the compounds in quantity, from natural sources,                     
              makes the work desirable.
