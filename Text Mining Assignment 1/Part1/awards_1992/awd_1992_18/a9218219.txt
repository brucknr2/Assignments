Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Small Grant for Exploratory Research: Proof of Concept Study for               
              Acoustically Telemetering XBT                                                  
                                                                                             
              This Oceanographic Instrumentation Development proposal seeks funds            
              to prove that development of an acoustically telemetering, Deep-               
              depth XBT (DDXBT) that could operate to depths in excess of 3,000              
              meters is technically feasible. Two previous proposals to develop              
              a DDXBT have been declined due to reviewer concerns about power                
              requirements, sensor reliability and acoustic transmission. In                 
              spite of the technical barriers, reviewers have been enthusiastic              
              about the scientific potential of the proposed DDXBT. This SGER                
              grant provides funds for the PI to conduct exploratory research                
              into the issues of power, sensors and acoustics for the DDXBT.                 
              Rossby proposes to provide scientific oversight with a majority of             
              the engineering research to be accomplished via a subcontract to               
              Spartan of Canada, Limited.
