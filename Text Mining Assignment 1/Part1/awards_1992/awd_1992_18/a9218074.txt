Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The evolution of closely separated binary stars can produce objects            
              and phenomena not found among single stars.  Low-mass X-ray                    
              emitting binary stars and symbiotic stars fall into this category,             
              but the evolutionary origins of these comparatively rare objects               
              are uncertain.  This research will explore possible origins of                 
              these objects by constructing model stellar populations, allowing              
              them to evolve under different scenarios.  A comparison of the                 
              evolved model populations with observed populations may shed light             
              on the precise mechanisms responsible for the formation of these               
              systems.
