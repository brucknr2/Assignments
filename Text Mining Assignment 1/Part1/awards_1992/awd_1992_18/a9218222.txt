Abstract    :
              A systematic study of aerosol formation in high temperature                    
              industrial processes is proposed.  The P.I. combines theoretical               
              analysis with relevant experiments, guided by several generic                  
              research goals related to understanding nucleation, quantifying                
              the structure of agglomerates, identifying scaling laws for                    
              particle formation and growth, and modeling self preserving size               
              distribution of the agglomerates.  The approach is based on                    
              selective experiments and modeling of the essential features of                
              particle growth as a function of the initial size distribution,                
              agglomeration of binary aerosols, formation of ceramic powders                 
              in flames, and particle collection.                                            
                                                                                             
              It is expected that this project, if successful, will lead to                  
              valuable results in aerosol science at high temperature,                       
              particularly on primary particle formation by coagulation-                     
              coalescence processes, with application to advanced materials                  
              synthesis in flames.
