Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              In this project the structures of weakly bound molecular                       
              complexes are to be investigated by means of high resolution                   
              Fourier transform microwave spectroscopy.  The project has six                 
              components: binary complexes containing 1) sulfur dioxide                      
              molecules, 2) water molecules, 3) cyclopropane molecules, and                  
              4) rare gas atoms; 5) complexes formed by three monomer                        
              molecules; and 6) high temperature investigations.  The                        
              complexes will be formed in the supersonic expansion into a                    
              vacuum of a high pressure mixture of component gases with a                    
              neutral carrier gas.  Through this expansion the complexes are                 
              also cooled to very low translational and rotational                           
              temperatures, about 10 degrees above the absolute zero.  The                   
              work will provide information on the structures and internal                   
              motions (dynamics) of the complexes, as well as on their                       
              electronic properties such as the electric dipole moment.  The                 
              results will provide fundamental information about the nature                  
              of weak interaction forces between molecules and on                            
              intermolecular potential functions, and will contribute to the                 
              data base needed to develop and test models and theories which                 
              can guide chemists and biochemists in how compounds can                        
              interact and grow into larger clusters.                                        
              %%%                                                                            
              The clusters which will be studied constitute a state of matter                
              that is intermediate between that of the dilute gas and the                    
              condensed phase and play a crucial role in condensation and                    
              evaporation phenomena.  Weak intermolecular forces also play a                 
              decisive role in the structure and function of biological                      
              systems, in which parts of a biological molecule interact with                 
              other parts to give it a structure characteristic of its                       
              function. Fundamental investigations on intermolecular forces                  
              as conducted in this research will also contribute to the data                 
              base on which the theories for the prediction of new                           
              biochemical substances can be tested and calibrated.
