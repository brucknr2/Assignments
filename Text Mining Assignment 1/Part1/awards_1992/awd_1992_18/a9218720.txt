Abstract    :
              This award supports a continuing investigation of the oxygen and               
              carbon isotopic composition and biostratigraphy of marine                      
              sedimentary sequences from the circum-Antarctic oceans.  These                 
              studies are aimed at reconstructing the paleoclimatic,                         
              paleoceanographic, and biotic evolution of the Antarctic region                
              during the Cenozoic.  Oceanographic and climatic evolution since               
              the middle Eocene (the last 52 million years) consists largely of              
              progressive cooling and glaciation of the polar regions and perhaps            
              warming in the tropics.  The climatic and glacial evolution of                 
              polar regions, including Antarctica, is crucial to our                         
              understanding of long term global climatic change because high                 
              latitudes are among the most sensitive regions to externally driven            
              change.  Strong feedback mechanisms involving ice albedo and bottom            
              water formation contribute to the development of polar regions.                
              The Cenozoic marine stratigraphic record is largely the product of             
              this climate evolution at high latitudes and hence it is crucial to            
              have the most complete record possible.  This investigation will               
              add to the record of proxy climate and environmental indicators by             
              using existing Ocean Drilling Program (ODP) cores.  For the                    
              Paleogene (Paleocene through Oligocene), work will focus on cores              
              from ODP Legs 113, 119, and 120.  For the Neogene (Oligocene                   
              through present), work will focus on ODP cores from low and middle             
              latitudes in the southwest and equatorial Pacific.  This work will             
              contribute significantly to a general understanding of the role of             
              polar regions in global climatic change.  In addition, this work               
              will contribute  to our understanding of the significance of the               
              Circum-Antarctic Current in Antarctic and global climate processes.            
              This work is particularly relevant in addressing the important                 
              question about the stability of the marine-based ice sheet of West             
              Antarctica.
