Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This award supports a three-year collaborative research project                
              between Professor Anil Kulkarni of the Pennsylvania State                      
              University and Dr. Yuji Hasemi, Building Research Institute,                   
              Ministry of Construction, Tsukuba, Japan.  In addition, a                      
              graduate student from Dr. Kulkarni's laboratory will conduct                   
              research at the Building Research Institute for this project.                  
                                                                                             
              The objective of the project is to understand the fundamentals of              
              the behavior of materials burning in an upward flame spread                    
              configuration under a simulated surrounding fire condition and to              
              develop a mathematical model to predict upward flame spread and                
              fire growth.  Upward flame spread is the most hazardous mode of                
              flame spread; and in a room fire situation where surrounding                   
              walls impart radiant flux to each other, upward flame spread                   
              rates are significantly enhanced.  The U.S. and Japanese groups                
              will approach the problem from different directions.  At Penn                  
              State, intermediate scale and small scale experimental facilities              
              have been constructed to study flame spread as well as to measure              
              relevant material properties, and a numerical upward flame spread              
              model has been developed.  At BRI there are extensive                          
              experimental facilities, large enough for full scale testing.                  
              The different approaches to investigation of upward flame spread               
              will allow the groups to benefit from each other's resources and               
              experience and will provide a cohesive research plan to enhance                
              progress toward understanding the upward flame spread process.
