Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The objective of this project is to understand how compressed                  
              fluids influence polymer morphology based on molecular                         
              interactions and phase behavior.  Many different polymers can                  
              be prepared into various physical forms through a variety of                   
              processes using compressed or supercritical fluids.                            
              Structures include microspheres, fibers, and foams as well as                  
              more unusual forms.  Theoretical and experimental                              
              thermodynamic studies are planned to examine polymer                           
              morphologies and processes with compressed fluids.  One part                   
              of the project involves determining the effect of CO2 on glass                 
              transition temperature with supercritical fluid                                
              chromatography.  A prediction of retrograde vitrification of                   
              glassy polymer, based on lattice fluid theory and the Gibbs-                   
              DiMarzio criterion for CO2 sorption and Tg, will be tested.                    
                                                                                             
              Polymers are versatile materials which are widely utilized in                  
              many commercial products.  New physical forms can improve                      
              performance and quality in existing applications or create new                 
              uses.  Applications anticipated for these materials range from                 
              new polymeric membranes and chromatographic packings for                       
              separations to lightweight structural components or even a                     
              matrix for artificial skin.***//
