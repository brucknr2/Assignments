Abstract    :
                This research is to develop a new theoretical approach to the                
              inversion of seismic wave-form data for determination of spatial               
              distributions of medium properties.  The new approach is based on              
              the renormalized source-type integral equation method recently                 
              proposed for inversion of electric field data to determine the 1-              
              D conductivity profile.  This research will attempt to extend the              
              new approach to the acoustic wave data to determine the 2-D and 3-             
              D velocity and density structure, in which the back-ground medium              
              is assumed to be vertically (1-D) heterogeneous.  The new approach             
              is expected to be superior to the usual linearization-iteration                
              procedure based on the first Born approximation.
