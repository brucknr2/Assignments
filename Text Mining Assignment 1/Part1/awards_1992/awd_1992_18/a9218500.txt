Abstract    :
                   This research seeks to obtain a comprehensive and innovative              
              set of key measurements on individual fish larvae that will fully              
              characterize the animal's size-specific growth, as well as the                 
              response of these measures to different food levels.  These values             
              will change with the animal's development, and so the size-related             
              changes in larval physiology and ecology must be characterized and             
              understood if their role in population processes is to be known.               
              The typical values of the measurements, their observed                         
              distributions and variability, and the strength of their relation              
              ship to one another, will be evaluated.  The underlying goals for              
              the work are:  1) to derive baseline information on the size-                  
              specific development patterns in individual marine fish larvae that            
              are expected to be important in field recruitment process studies,             
              and 2) to intercompare this set of condition indices to learn the              
              strength of the relationships among them, and what their relative              
              value would be for indicating overall animal condition and                     
              predicting continued survival.
