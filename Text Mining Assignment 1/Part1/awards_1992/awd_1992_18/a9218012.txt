Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The Allegheny Observatory Trigonometric Parallax Program.                      
                                                                                             
              The hallmark of the astrometric program at the Allegheny                       
              Observatory is high precision, approximately 0.001 arcsecond per               
              parallax.  Combining the Multichannel Astrometric Photometer and               
              the new optical system of the Thaw refractor, the program has                  
              sufficient precision to obtain reliable trigonometric distances of             
              several open star clusters as well as other luminosity standards               
              in most parts of the Hertsprung-Russell diagram.  Combined with                
              data from a 70 year baseline photographic plate collection, the                
              MAP/Thaw system has sufficient precision to define portions of the             
              mass luminosity relationship previously outside of the domain of               
              trigonometric techniques, and to make significant improvements in              
              our understanding of the effects of age and chemical composition               
              on the energy output of stars.
