Abstract    :
                   The problem of hub location can be viewed as a nonconvex                  
              optimization problem which has parallels in other applications as              
              well.  Here, the critical input parameters may be dynamic, so                  
              this work will consider sensitivity analysis for heuristic                     
              solutions.                                                                     
                   This award supports the cross-disciplinary efforts and the                
              development of a research collaboration involving quantitative                 
              modelling in the geosciences.  In particular the mathematicians                
              and the geographer will focus their attention on the development               
              of new optimization algorithms for the problem of assigning hub                
              facilities when these are restricted to specific available                     
              locations and when the flow of activity from one point or node to              
              another is known or can be modelled mathematically.
