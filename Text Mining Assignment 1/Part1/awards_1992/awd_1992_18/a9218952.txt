Abstract    :
              This project is a systematic field study of atmospheric sulfur                 
              chemistry in the antarctic troposphere.  The specific objective is             
              to obtain a comprehensive data base for estimating the potential               
              impact of dimethylsulfide (DMS) emissions on the climate of                    
              Antarctica, and by extension, the global climate.  Field                       
              measurements will be conducted at Palmer Station during two austral            
              summer months in the 1993-94 and the 1994-95 season.                           
                                                                                             
              It is known that approximately 80 to 90 percent of the aerosol                 
              mass deposited to the antarctic ice sheet consists of fine par-                
              ticles of non-sea salt sulfate.  These particles are though to be              
              formed by gas-to-particle conversion involving biogenic sulfur                 
              gases emitted from the Southern Ocean.  Some antarctic                         
              phytoplankton species emit large quantities of DMS which is                    
              subsequently oxidized by the hydroxyl radical, forming sulfuric                
              acid as one of the end products.  Sulfuric acid in the atmosphere              
              may condense to form nanometer droplets or become condensed on pre-            
              existing aerosol particles; these phase transitions form non-sea               
              salt sulfate which is then precipitated to the ice sheet.                      
                                                                                             
              These processes will be traced by the direct measurement of                    
              twenty sulfur-containing species as well as the aerosol and                    
              condensation nuclei size distribution.  Recently developed highly              
              sensitive techniques will be applied to the antarctic troposphere              
              for the first time.                                                            
                                                                                             
              The resulting information will be used to assess the relative                  
              importance of individual chemical reaction pathways which will                 
              contribute to the better understanding of the marine biogenic                  
              sulfur record in antarctic ice cores with respect to past climate              
              changes.  It will also provide a model data base for estimating the            
              sensitivity of the present climate of Antarctica to volcanic or                
              anthropogenic sulfur pollution and its effect on the ultraviolet               
              radiation regime.
