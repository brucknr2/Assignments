Abstract    :
              This is an award to support research on                                        
              identification and quantification of chemical                                  
              reaction products when chlorine is used to                                     
              disinfect wastewater treatment plant                                           
              effluents.  This project is a renewal of                                       
              research conducted under NSF Grant No. 90-                                     
              02442.  Special emphasis in this research is                                   
              on reactions between nitrogenous organic                                       
              compounds such as the amino acids and                                          
              peptides that are found in treatment plant                                     
              effluents.  The investigator plans on using                                    
              radiotracer techniques to determine the                                        
              stability and breakdown products of the                                        
              chlorinated organic compounds.                                                 
                                                                                             
              Chlorination of wastewater treatment plant                                     
              effluents is a process relied on for                                           
              disinfection of the effluents prior to their                                   
              placement into environmental waters despite                                    
              the known formation of chlorinated organic                                     
              compounds that subject the environment and                                     
              subsequent users of those waters to potential                                  
              health risk.  Results of this project are                                      
              expected to provide the basis for any changes                                  
              that may be necessary in use of and in the                                     
              engineering design of chlorination processes                                   
              to avoid or eliminate negative effects                                         
              associated with this practice.
