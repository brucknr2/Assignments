Abstract    :
                   Naturally induced electromagnetic fields (magnetotelluric                 
              fields) are highly dependent on both the vertical and horizontal               
              conductivity structure of the earth and are greatly influenced by              
              three-dimensional features.  Three-dimensional magnetotelluric                 
              modeling algorithms are critical for correctly interpreting                    
              observed data, but the current generation of algorithms are                    
              computationally expensive and time-consuming.  The objective of                
              this proposal is to develop three-dimensional magnetotelluric                  
              modeling algorithms that can model fully inhomogeneous earth models            
              and that are quick and can be run on modern scientific                         
              workstations.  The algorithm to be developed through this project              
              will use conjugate direction relaxation algorithms coupled with                
              appropriate preconditioners and a multiple scaling technique.
