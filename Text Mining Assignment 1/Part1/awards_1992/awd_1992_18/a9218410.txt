Abstract    :
                   This supplemental award funds the Industry/University                     
              Cooperative Research Center for Polymers (CUMIRP) at the University            
              of Massachusetts, Amherst, for two years to support a sabbatical by            
              Dr. Sheila Browne, Chemistry Department Chair, Mt. Holyoke College.            
              This sabbatical will be to perform a research project at (CUMIRP).             
              Dr. Browne will be conducting research on the enzymatic processes              
              involved in polymer formation in the granules of bacteria, in                  
              collaboration with Dr. Robert W. Lenz and attending graduate                   
              polymer courses.  Dr. Browne plans to teach a polymer course at Mt.            
              Holyoke College which will be based on the material that she learns            
              while on sabbatical at the University of Massachusetts.  This                  
              course will become a regular advanced course in the Chemistry                  
              Department at Mt. Holyoke for chemistry majors.  In addition, Dr.              
              Browne, who is part Cherokee Indian, will make a number of trips to            
              visit Cherokee tribes in North Carolina and Oklahoma to establish              
              a program to recruit American Indians into science and hopefully               
              into chemistry.                                                                
                   The Program Director recommends that the University of                    
              Massachusetts, Amherst be awarded $64,000 for two years for support            
              of sabbatical for Dr. Sheila Browne.
