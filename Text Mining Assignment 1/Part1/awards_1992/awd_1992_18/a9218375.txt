Abstract    :
              This grant from the Organic Dynamics Program supports the                      
              continuing work of Professor Edward M. Arnett at Duke                          
              University.  Heats of heterolysis, homolysis and electron                      
              transfer for a wide spectrum of organic compounds will be                      
              determined using calorimetry and electrochemical techniques.                   
              The heterolytic bond strengths will be determined from heats of                
              reactions of carbon electrophiles (e.g., carbenium ions,                       
              carbonyl functions, Michael acceptors, activated aromatics)                    
              with a wide range of nucleophiles (e.g., carbanions, ylides,                   
              alkoxides, thiolates, nitroanions).  These experiments will be                 
              used to compare directly heterolytic and homolytic cleavages of                
              covalent bonds.  This work will allow the building of a basic                  
              thermodynamic framework by which many processes for making and                 
              breaking bonds to carbon can be compared directly.                             
              %%%                                                                            
              A thermodynamic framework will be built for bonds between                      
              carbon and hetero atoms. Calorimetry and electrochemical                       
              techniques are the experimental methods of choice.  By                         
              measuring bond dissociation energies and the heats of reaction                 
              between ionic species, a common scale can be determined for a                  
              large spectrum of bonds.  The data to be obtained from this                    
              research will form an important thermodynamic database that is                 
              to provide fundamental insight in the bond making/breaking                     
              processes of all organic reactions.
