Abstract    :
              9218730  Renne       This award provides partial funding for the acquisition of
              a  cryogenic magnetometer that is to be installed and operated in the 
              Geochronology Center at the Institute of Human Origins (IHO). The  IHO is
              committed to providing the remaining funds needed for the  purchase and
              installation of the equipment.        The Geochronology Center is engaged in a
              broad spectrum of  research activities in the earth sciences that use
              paleomagnetism  (measure of the earth's ancient magnetic field orientation as 
              recorded in the magnetic minerals of ancient rocks). The  sensitivity of the
              new cryogenic magnetometer is needed in a number  of research projects that
              include: (1) Refinement of the  geomagnetic polarity time scale ... when in the
              past did the  earth's magnetic field reverse itself? (2) Stratigraphic studies.
               (3) Tectonic studies, and (4) The research of non-IHO scientists  who will be
              encouraged to utilize the new facility.  ***
