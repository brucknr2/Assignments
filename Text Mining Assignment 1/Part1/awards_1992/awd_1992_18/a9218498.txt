Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              An international symposium is to be partially supported.  The                  
              topic is "Nonlinear Stability of Non-Parallel Flow", the                       
              location is Clarkson University, and the dates are July 26-                    
              28, 1993.  Support is also being provided for a bilateral                      
              workshop immediately following the symposium, on the same                      
              topic, with selected participants form the US and the FSU.                     
              The workshop objective is to explore opportunities and                         
              mechanisms for cooperative research in this topic.                             
                                                                                             
              Non-linear stability of non-parallel flows is a specialty area                 
                                                                                             
              in the transition between laminar and turbulent flows, and                     
              because of its complexity it has not receives attention                        
              commensurate to its importance in a broad range of engineering                 
                                                                                             
              applications involving turbulence.
