Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Marine phytoplankton produce a variety of organic osmolytes                    
              including the nitrogenous compound glycine betaine (GBT) and                   
              its sulfur analog, dimethylsulfoniopropionate (DMSP).  It                      
              appears that GBT and DMSP make large and hitherto                              
              unrecognized contributions to the cellular nitrogen and                        
              sulfur pools in many species of marine phytoplankton and to                    
              particulate organic nitrogen (PON) and particulate organic                     
              sulfur (POS) pools in surface sea water.  Very little is                       
              known about the production, distribution and cycling of                        
              these labile biogenic compounds. Information from the                          
              literature and from preliminary studies suggests that many                     
              species of phytoplankton produce both GBT and DMSP                             
              simultaneously and that nitrogen availability may affect the                   
              relative proportions of GBT and DMSP.  This project will                       
              conduct laboratory and field studies to test the following                     
              hypotheses:  1) GBT makes up a significant (5-20%) fraction                    
              of cellular nitrogen in certain species of marine                              
              phytoplankton and DMSP is a major constituent of cellular                      
              sulfur; 2) There is a relationship between taxonomy and GBT                    
              and DMSP production; 3) The levels of GBT and GMSP in                          
              phytoplankton are a function of nitrogen availability, with                    
              DMSP favored under N-limitation; 4) Phytoplankton take up                      
              GBT and DMSP from their surroundings and release them under                    
              certain conditions; 5) Production of GBT over DMSP, or                         
              selection of species which produce GBT, will be favored in                     
              high nitrogen environments.  This study will provide new and                   
              important data on the quantitative role of methylated                          
              nitrogen and sulfur osmolytes to the cellular nitrogen and                     
              sulfur budgets of phytoplankton and to PON and POS in the                      
              sea.  This information will lead to a better understanding                     
              of the biological cycling of nitrogen and sulfur in the                        
              ocean.
