Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Existing curricula in materials processing are generally outdated,             
              lack an interdisciplinary approach, and are limited in their scope             
              and availability to undergraduate students.  Iowa State University             
              will address these shortcomings by developing eleven flexible                  
              course modules, each of 4 to 6 weeks duration, which emphasize                 
              ceramic powder processing, metal powder processing, and the                    
              processing of glass and of electronic materials.  Industrial                   
              practice will be introduced prior to designing model experiments               
              and discussing fundamental concepts.  Each module will also be                 
              linked to appropriate structural and mechanical characterization               
              activities.  The modules can be used either to update existing                 
              courses by inserting them in place of outdated materials or to form            
              an entire new course. Each module will be in the form of a booklet,            
              video tape, and computer disk.  Modules will be made available for             
              use and evaluation by other institutions as they are developed and             
              tested at Iowa State.  Evaluation will be carried out on the basis             
              of the effectiveness of the modules in addressing the key                      
              weaknesses in current undergraduate materials curricula and in                 
              terms of their effectiveness in attracting more students,                      
              particularly minorities and women, into the materials field.
