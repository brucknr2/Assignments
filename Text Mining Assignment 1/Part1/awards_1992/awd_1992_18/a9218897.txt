Abstract    :
                   The PI has recovered detailed paleomagnetic secular variation             
              records and associated rock magnetic data from high accumulation-              
              rate deep-sea sediments of the Blake Outer Ridge and Bermuda Rise.             
              He has used these results to develop a relative paleointensity                 
              record.  Results correlate well with three other recent relative               
              paleointensity estimates for the last 100,000 years.  However,                 
              relative paleointensity record is strongly influenced by                       
              environmental effects (magnetic-fraction grain-size variations).               
              The PI will develop new relative paleointensity normalization                  
              methods that will better remove subtle environmental effects in our            
              records, and test these methods by sediment redeposition                       
              experiments which vary field intensity and magnetic-fraction grain             
              size in both artificial and natural sediments.  Results of this                
              study will have broad application to relative paleointensity                   
              studies of both deep-sea and lacustrine sediments.
