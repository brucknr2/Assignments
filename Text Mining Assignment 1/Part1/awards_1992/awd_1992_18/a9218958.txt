Abstract    :
              The objective of this project is to increase the resistance to                 
              surficial erosion and to shallow sliding or sloughing in sandy                 
              coastal slopes as a result of both increased effective stress                  
              from developed compression on the ground surface and by an                     
              increase in apparent cohesion from fibrous root development                    
              around imbedded live stems and cuttings. The effectiveness of                  
              combining soil bioengineering measures such as live staking and                
              fascines with anchored netting systems will be investigated.                   
              Analytical studies will be carried out to determine the optimal                
              anchorage system for netting and geofabrics that takes into                    
              account the geometric arrangement, spacing, length, and                        
              inclination of the anchors in addition to the visco-elastic                    
              properties and stretched shape of the netting.
