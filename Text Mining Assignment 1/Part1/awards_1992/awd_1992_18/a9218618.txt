Abstract    :
              The long-range goals of this research are (1) to understand how DNA            
              precursor biosynthesis is regulated; (2) to understand how                     
              regulatory mechanisms affecting DNA precursor synthesis control the            
              rate and fidelity of DNA replication; (3) to understand the                    
              metabolic and genetic consequences of pertubations in DNA precursor            
              biosynthesis; and (4) to contribute toward an understanding of                 
              mechanisms of action of the enzymes involved.  The proposed                    
              research involves a multienzyme complex, formed in T4 phage-                   
              infected Escherichia coli, which carries out the synthesis of                  
              deoxyribonucleoside triphosphates (dNTPs).  This is the T4 dNTP                
              synthetase complex.  The wealth of genetic and biochemical                     
              knowledge of T4 permits a variety of powerful approaches to                    
              understanding protein-protein interactions in this system.                     
              %%%                                                                            
              DNA replication uses precursors, the deoxyribonucleoside                       
              triphosphates, which are specialized for that purpose and for                  
              little else.  In addition to replication, dNTPs are used in DNA                
              repair and in recombination; also, bacteria used dTTP in cell wall             
              synthesis.  This limited repertoire of metabolic role makes it                 
              possible for DNA synthesis to be regulated specifically at the                 
              level of precursor formation.  This research attempts to describe              
              how dNTP synthesis is controlled and the extend to which these                 
              mechanisms contribute toward the control of DNA replication.
