Abstract    :
              The goals of this study are (1) expression of individual histone H1            
              variants, (2) quantitation of their interactions with DNA of                   
              defined sequence, (3) determination of the effects of histone                  
              binding on the conformation of DNA utilizing CD spectroscopy, and              
              (4) determination of the roles of various H1 domain structures in              
              the interaction with DNA.  The results of this work will help                  
              clarify the nature of the interactions of relatively non-specific              
              DNA-binding proteins with DNA.  These studies will provide a                   
              preliminary indication of the nature of structure-function                     
              correlations in histone:DNA interactions.

              The complexity of eucariotic organisms dictates a requirement for              
              large DNA structures which can only be accomodated in the limited              
              volume of the living cell by means of interactions with proteins               
              such as the histones which wrap the DNA into tightly packed                    
              structures which nonetheless permit access of the cell's                       
              biosynthetic machinery to the DNA.  The studies proposed                       
              investigate the interaction of naturally occurring variants of                 
              histone H1.  The histones are extremely difficult to purify.  This             
              study involves the novel use of pure histones produced by molecular            
              biological methods.  The affinity of the histones with a variety of            
              DNA structures will be examined and to some extent the structures              
              of the histones and DNA in the complexes will be determined.                   
              Comparison of the affinity of the various histone variants with DNA            
              structures will establish the relationship between the structures              
              of histones and their affinity for DNA.  The interaction of                    
              histones with DNA structures is an important subject for study                 
              because of the potential importance of DNA:histone complexes in                
              controlling the function, development, and maturation of living                
              cells.
