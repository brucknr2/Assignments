Abstract    :
              9218790  Fulker       The purpose of this proposal is to continue Unidata's well
               established role of supporting universities and to undertake a  limited number
              of new initiatives. The mission of the Unidata  Program is to empower
              universities, through innovative applications  of current computing and
              networking technology, to make the best  use of atmospheric and related data
              for enhancing education and  research.  To this end, the Unidata Program Center
              and the  university community have jointly built a nationwide computing and 
              communications system that provides universities with easy, cost-  effective
              access to atmospheric data and has transformed how the  atmospheric sciences
              are taught on campuses across the nation.
