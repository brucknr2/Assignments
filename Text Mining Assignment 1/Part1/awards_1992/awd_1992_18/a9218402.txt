Abstract    :
                   Current methods for determining the slip vector or                        
              sense of shear for brittle fault zones of any age or seismic                   
              capability are largely based on the orientation of                             
              striations.  Brittle fault zones lacking striations are                        
              difficult or impossible to analyze kinematically by these                      
              methods.  The primary objective of this research is to test                    
              the general applicability of a new, symmetry-based method                      
              for stereographically and statistically determining the                        
              synoptic slip vector in non-striated fault zones.  The model                   
              will be tested by measuring and analyzing Riedel structures                    
              and folds developed in the basal, gouge-filled shear zones                     
              of several Cenozoic to Recent landslides or rock avalanches                    
              in the southwestern US where the slip vector is known.                         
              Results will help validate a new method for determining slip                   
              directions in unstriated brittle faults which are common in                    
              nature.
