Abstract    :
              The goals of this research are (1) to understand the roles of                  
              allosteric interactions in the regulation of metabolite transfer               
              between sequential enzymes in a metabolic pathway, (2) to                      
              understand the relationship between enzyme conformation change,                
              substrate specificity, and catalysis, and (3) to explore the                   
              significance of direct metabolite transfer in systems which contain            
              more than one type of catalytic site.  Tryptophan synthase systems             
              from E. coli and S. typhimurium (bienzyme complexes) and yeast and             
              blue-green algae (multienzymes) will be studied utilizing rapid                
              mixing kinetic techniques in combination with absorbance and                   
              fluorescence spectrophotometry, and high resolution nuclear                    
              magnetic resonance.                                                            
              %%%                                                                            
              The efficiency of cellular metabolism requires the existence of                
              multienzyme complexes which catalyze a sequence of chemical changes            
              on metabolites.  The efficiency derived from not having to                     
              recapture intermediates from the exterior milieu is suspected to be            
              the primary reason for such highly organized processing.  The                  
              proposed research explores an ideal model system for such linked               
              enzyme-catalyzed processing of substrates.  In the case of                     
              tryptophan synthase, substrate is passed through a "tunnel" between            
              the enzyme active sites.  The studies planned will examine how the             
              two active sites interact with each other in order to optimize                 
              catalysis and transfer of metabolites between them.  A great deal              
              will potentially be learned through this work about the way this               
              complex protein machinery works and why it is designed as it is.
