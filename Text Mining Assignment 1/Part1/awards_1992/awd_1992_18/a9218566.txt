Abstract    :
              This research focuses on the development of new regio- and                     
              stereoselective methods for the synthesis of complex                           
              structures.  Highlights of the research include: the                           
              stereochemical control by the formation of 6-membered rings via                
              intramolecular opening of allylic epoxides by carbanions; the                  
              synthesis of cardenolides using radical cyclization processes;                 
              the stereocontrolled synthesis of heavily functionalized                       
              6-membered rings by the cationic cyclization of epoxides; the                  
              synthetic use of lithio compounds bearing functional groups;                   
              and, the control of regiochemistry in 2+2 cycloadditions by the                
              temporary silicon connection and other temporary connectors.

              With this Renewal award the Synthetic Organic Program is                       
              supporting the research of Professor Gilbert Stork of the                      
              Department of Chemistry at Columbia University.  Dr. Stork will                
              focus his work on developing new organic reactions within the                  
              context of synthesizing complex organic molecules.
