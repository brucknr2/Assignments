Abstract    :
                   Due to the recent turn down of submarine telephone cables by              
              their commercial operators, there is an opportunity to make                    
              planetary scale measurements of the geodlectric field variations               
              on the unpowered cables at a number of locations around the world.             
              Recent work indicates that the long (thousands of km) cables                   
              average out the motionally-induced electric field from ocean flows             
              out to periods of 10-20 days, in contrast to point electric field              
              sensors which are dominated by the ocean at 4 days or longer.  This            
              means that the cable electric field may be used for deep sounding              
              of the electrical conductivity of the mantle by the magetotelluric             
              methods to depths extending well into the lower mantle.  This                  
              project is a preliminary magetotelluric study using existing data              
              from the HAW-1 cable collected at Bell Labs and the installation               
              of special high stability voltage monitoring equipment on three                
              segments of TPC-1 extending from Hawaii to Midway, Midway to Wake,             
              and Wake to Guam.  This will enable the potential difference across            
              the entire Pacific basin to be measured.
