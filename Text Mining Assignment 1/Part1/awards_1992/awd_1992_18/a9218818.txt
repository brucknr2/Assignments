Abstract    :
              9218818  Kogoma  Five investigators of the Department of Cell Biology with 
              active research programs in biomedical applications of  molecular genetics and
              molecular biology request funds for  the purchase of an autoradiogram imaging
              system,  PhosphorImager 400E, to facilitate their research.  Many  experiments
              of these investigators involve autoradiography  of a number of flat samples
              such as Southern, Northern, and  Western blots; dot and slot blots; one- and
              two-dimensional  gels for separation of proteins; and CAT assays.  Several 
              experiments that uniquely take advantage of  the superior  sensitivity and
              resolution that the instrument offers are  described. The data to be obtained
              from these experiments  are very difficult, if not impossible, to acquire by
              other  means.  Furthermore, the instrument is expected to allow  acquisition of
              data with much greater precision and speed  than the conventional X-ray film
              autoradiography.  Thus, the  instrument will speed up progress on the research
              projects  and permit a greater contribution to the overall effort to  solve the
              significant problems facing medical sciences  today.  Although priority will be
              given to the participating  major users of  this application, the instrument
              will be  made available to other investigators of this research  community to
              maximize the usage and benefit of the  instrument.
