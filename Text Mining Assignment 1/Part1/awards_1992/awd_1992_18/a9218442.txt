Abstract    :
              This in-depth three year study examines Inupiat Eskimo childrearing            
              in Northwest Alaska. The investigation fills a 30 year gap in                  
              information about childrearing beliefs and practices in village                
              Alaska within the context of rapidly changing social and cultural              
              norms. A particular focus will be on the divergence of attitudes               
              and how they impact children. Following a pilot study of extended              
              families in Kotzebue, intergenerational families in remote villages            
              (Noorvik, Kiana) will be examined. This triangulated approach to               
              data collection includes traditional anthropological fieldwork and             
              participant observation, combined with life-history interviews of              
              family members by trained local villagers. The study is intended to            
              advance the science of cross-cultural family theory and child                  
              development, as well as to provide information on contemporary                 
              parenting for the Northwest Arctic Borough.
