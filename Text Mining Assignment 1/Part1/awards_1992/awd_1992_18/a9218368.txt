Abstract    :
              This investigation of intramolecular and solvation dynamics in                 
              ultrafast nonlinear spectroscopy is a part of the Theoretical                  
              and Computational Chemistry Program of the Division of                         
              Chemistry.  The optical response of chromophores in polar and                  
              nonpolar liquids is being computationally simulated.  Both                     
              benzene/argon and water clusters are being studied.  Methods                   
              for calculating the cooperative radiative dynamics of confined                 
              excitons is being developed and applied to the excitonic                       
              response of rare-gas clusters.  Superradiance and polariton                    
              effects on retarded intermolecular interactions in liquids and                 
              disordered solids are being treated in a consistent way.                       
              %%%                                                                            
              Modern spectroscopic methods often reveal how molecules in                     
              liquids and solids interact with each other and with radiation.                
              This information can be obtained with aid of theories and                      
              computational simulations of the types being developed in this                 
              program of studies and applied to systems such as clusters of                  
              water molecules.
