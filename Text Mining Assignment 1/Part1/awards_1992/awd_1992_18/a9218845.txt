Abstract    :
              The principal focus of this ongoing research involves                          
              structural and crystal chemical characterization of earth                      
              materials believed to occur in the Earth's upper mantle and                    
              transition zone.  Information on Fe/Mg ordering in mantle                      
              silicates and its effect on mantle mineral equations of                        
              state and on the extent of polyhedral distortion in                            
              silicates above 10 GPa will be obtained at high temperatures                   
              and pressures using diamond anvil pressure cells.  This                        
              research has application in understanding earth processes as                   
              the dynamic history and present state of the Earth's deep                      
              interior result from properties of its constituent                             
              materials.   The research will conducted at the Geophysical                    
              Laboratory (Carnegie Institute of Washington), which                           
              supports the only American facility engaged primarily in                       
              high-pressure, single-crystal, x-ray diffraction studies of                    
              minerals and their analogues.  The crystallographic                            
              laboratory will also continue to serve the American                            
              materials research community.
