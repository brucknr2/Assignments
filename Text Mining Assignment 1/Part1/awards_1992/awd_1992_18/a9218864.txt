Abstract    :
              Xenoliths from the southwestern U.S. will be analyzed to                       
              study the compositional and thermal evolution of mantle                        
              lithosphere and the relationships between mantle properties                    
              and crustal tectonics.  Characterization of textures and                       
              compositional gradients will be combined with electron                         
              microprobe and PIXE analysis of thin sections and with                         
              isotopic analysis of mineral separates.  Xenoliths from the                    
              Grand Canyon field on the Colorado Plateau will be studied                     
              in most detail.  Compositions and thermal histories of the                     
              samples will be compared to those of xenoliths from the                        
              Basin and Range province, to learn how crustal uplift and                      
              extension are related to mantle dynamics.  Textures and Sr-                    
              Nd systematics in the Grand Canyon xenoliths are unusual,                      
              and they will be characterized to understand metasomatic                       
              processes that may be subduction-related.  A large                             
              collection from the Navajo field in the central Plateau has                    
              been recently acquired, and choice samples will be analyzed                    
              to determine depth and timing of mantle hydration and                          
              eclogite-facies recrystallization.  In all parts of the                        
              study, particular effort will be made to elucidate transport                   
              processes and rates of mineral equilibration in the mantle,                    
              by careful analyses of gradients and by numerical                              
              simulations.
