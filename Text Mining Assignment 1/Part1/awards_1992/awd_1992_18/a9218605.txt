Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Trigonometric parallaxes of nearby stars are fewer in number and               
              lower in precision than is generally perceived.  Most parallax                 
              determinations are more than twenty years old and thus have errors             
              much larger than those possible in recent years, even with                     
              conventional equipment.  This program has made use of this increase            
              in precision in obtaining parallaxes and proper motions since 1967.            
              It is one of the two most extensive such programs now active.  It              
              would continue to enrich the number of high-precision parallaxes               
              and photometry of stars of the lower main sequence, as well as                 
              subdwarf type stars.  These stars are among the oldest in our                  
              Galaxy, and their parallaxes and distances are not now well known.             
              It is expected that the program will calibrate the distance scale              
              of these old stars with much greater precision than is now                     
              available.  Photometry and possibly radial velocities are acquired             
              as necessary.  It is also intended that students will be trained               
              in all aspects of the program.
