Abstract    :
              This is an integrated petrological  and geochemical  study                     
              of the 630-650 m.y. old Egersund dikes from SW Norway.  The                    
              dikes are remarkably fresh, are relatively  unoxidized, and                    
              contain glass.  They provide an outstanding opportunity to                     
              study the high-pressure evolution (via fractionation and                       
              assimilation) of continental basalts, and to study                             
              assimilation processes in detail.  The proposed  research,                     
              involves acquisition of  microprobe data for phenocryst,                       
              megacryst, xenocryst and xenolith phases, whole-rock major                     
              (including Fe2O3 and FeO) and trace element data for dikes,                    
              glasses, melt areas in xenoliths and whole xenoliths, and                      
              limited isotopic (Sr, Nd, Pb) data for dikes and xenoliths.                    
              These  data will be used to model the evolution of the                         
              magmas, and place constraints on the mantle source region                      
              using data from the least involved, uncontaminated dikes.
