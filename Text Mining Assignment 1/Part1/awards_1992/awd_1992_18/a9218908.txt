Abstract    :
              The P.I.s propose a series of crystallization experiments on                   
              Mauna Loa basalt compositions with the goals of (1)                            
              quantifying relationships between magmatic undercooling,                       
              cooling rate and crystallization rates of all phases in 1984                   
              Mauna Loa basalt, (2) repeating the experiments on a more                      
              magnesian composition, (3) extending the experiments to                        
              include variations in temperature, and (4) calibrating a                       
              glass geothermometer for Mauna Loa basalt compositions.                        
              These experiments will be complemented by a detailed                           
              textural study of a series of near-vent samples collected                      
              during the 1984 eruption of Mauna Loa.  Finally, the P.I.s                     
              propose a related study on near-surface vesiculation in                        
              Hawaiian basalt using samples from the current eruption of                     
              Kilauea Volcano to (1) determine rates of lava degassing,                      
              (2) study mechanisms of bubble coalescence, (3) document                       
              post-emplacement modifications to original bubble size                         
              distributions, and (4) use textural measurements of                            
              pumiceous products of fire fountaining episodes to constrain                   
              proposed models of fire fountain formation.  By combining                      
              textural and chemical studies of experimental and well-                        
              documented natural samples we can substantially advance our                    
              understanding of these processes in Hawaiian basalts.
