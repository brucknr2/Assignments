Abstract    :
              This grant is in support of the second Topical                                 
              Meeting on Nonlinear Optics (Optical Society of                                
              America): Materials, Fundamentals and                                          
              Applications.  This conference will be held August                             
              17-21, 1992, in Maui, Mawaii and will provide a                                
              forum for discussion of optics; including new                                  
              phenomena, novel devices, and advanced materials.                              
              Topics covered will include: Fundamental Studies;
