Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  This project involves an integrated transect of boreholes on              
              the U.S. mid-Atlantic region to address the continental margin                 
              record of the Oligocene-Recent global sea-level changes.  These                
              changes have been controlled by glacioeustatic (ice-volume)                    
              variations.  Transects of passive continental margins from outcrop             
              to the deep sea are needed to evaluate the timing and amplitude of             
              sea-level variations.  The transect requires drilling both onshore             
              and offshore (ODP Leg 150).  The Principal Investigators will drill            
              three continuously cored and logged boreholes in the New Jersey                
              coastal plain near Island Beach, Atlantic City, and Cape May, NJ.              
              The project will be a collaborative effort among Rutgers,                      
              LDGO/Columbia, and the Eastern Regional Branch of the USGS.                    
                                                                                             
                   The multidisciplinary use of magnetostratigraphy,                         
              biostratigraphy, Sr-isotope stratigraphy and oxygen isotope                    
              glacioeustatic curves combined with seismic stratigraphy to tie                
              together onshore and offshore wells will provide a comprehensive               
              data set.  The geologic record of sea level changes gives factual              
              constraints for developing models of global paleoclimatological                
              change.
