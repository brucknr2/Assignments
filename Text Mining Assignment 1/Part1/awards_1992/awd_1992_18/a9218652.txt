Abstract    :
                This research is to utilize a finite-difference computer program             
              to simulate dynamic rupture fault propogation on non-coplanar fault            
              segments.  This 3-D treatment allows the incorporation of fault                
              segment lengts, widths, and depths, stress levels, and velocity                
              structure.  For large earthquakes that break through the entire                
              seismogenic zone, the only barrier that remains to terminate the               
              rupture and limit the size of the earthquake must lie along the                
              strike of the fault.  A segment can be one of these barriers, but              
              fault segmentation is observed at many different length-scales in              
              the field.  The purpose of this project is to quantify the size of             
              this barrier which can control the length of earthquake rupture.               
              This research is a component of the National Earthquake Hazard                 
              Reduction Program.
