              Galactic Structure and Kinematics from Absolute Proper Motions.                
                                                                                             
              The study of the motions of various classes of stars is fundamental            
              to an understanding of our Galaxy.  Proper motions provide the                 
              observational basis for the study of solar motions, galactic                   
              rotation, and velocity dispersions, and for the statistical                    
              determination of stellar distances and luminosities.  The Lick                 
              Northern Proper Motion (NPM) program meets many of these basic                 
              observational needs by providing absolute proper motions covering              
              the northern two thirds of the sky.  The NPM is now bearing fruit              
              after more than 40 years of work.  First epoch photography began               
              in 1947; second epoch photography was completed in 1988.                       
              Measurements and reductions for proper motions, positions, and                 
              photometry in the sky outside the Milky Way began in 1975 and will             
              be competed in 1992.                                                           
                                                                                             
              This award supports several long awaited applications of the NPM               
              absolute proper motions to outstanding problems in galactic                    
              structure and kinematics.  These include a definitive study of                 
              solar motion and galactic rotation, a powerful probe of changing               
              stellar populations and kinematics away from the galactic plane,               
              and a massive new study of RR Lyrae type star luminosities and                 
              kinematics.  This award will also support publication of the Lick              
              NPM Catalog and advance work on the final part of the NPM program.
