Abstract    :
                   Professor Galik is the chairman of the organizing                         
              committee of the 1992 International Symposium on Lepton and                    
              Photon Interactions.  The conference will be held in Ithaca,                   
              New York, at Cornell, on August 10-15, 1993.  This grant, in                   
              support of the conference, will continue the tradition of the                  
              'Lepton-Photon' international conferences began in Cambridge,                  
              Massachusetts, in 1963.  These conferences will be held every                  
              other year under the auspices of the International Union of                    
              Pure and Applied Physics, bring together about 1000 physicists                 
              from throughout the world to discuss the latest results in                     
              elementary particle physics research.
