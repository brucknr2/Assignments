Abstract    :
              The object of this proposal is the development of scalable                     
              parallel computing algorithms for multi-particle system flow                   
              with negligible inertial effects.  The particles may have                      
              arbitrary shape and roughness.  The preparation of the governing               
              equation combined with the use of the advanced parallel computer               
              in suspension rheology.  The governing Stokes equations are                    
              transformed into a set of Fredholm integral equations of second                
              kind with double-layer densities on the surfaces of particles                  
                                                                                             
              and on the boundary of the system.  The methodology can be                     
              applied to dilute and concentrated suspension flow, non-                       
              spherical particles and irregularly bounding walls.  The                       
              emphasis of this proposal is on the computational algorithm                    
              rather than physical problems.  The goal is to reduce the                      
              frequency of inter-processor communication, and to shorten the                 
                                                                                             
              inter-processor messages, which would increase the overall                     
              computational speed.                                                           
                                                                                             
              The development of an efficient computational methodology for                  
                                                                                             
              suspension flow at low Reynolds numbers has a broad range of                   
              applications in chemical, pharmaceutical and other industrial                  
                                                                                             
              processes that use particulate suspensions.
