Abstract    :
                   The PI will develop several numerical formulations for the                
              purpose of studying fault-like behavior in viscous flow                        
              calculations, specifically applied to understanding the dynamics               
              of subduction zones.  he will compare formulations, including the              
              formulations currently used in plate calculations,  using                      
              observables such a gravity and topography profiles, stress                     
              distributions (in the plate and slab), compressional and                       
              extensional tectonic environments (e.g., formation of back arc                 
              basins or mountain belts), plate velocity and slab dip.  This                  
              systematic comparison will not only highlight strengths and                    
              weaknesses of the various methods, it will call attention to                   
              features which are unique to one particular methods and may be an              
              artifact of that method, not a robust characteristic of faulting.              
              On the other hand, since each method is built on different set of              
              assumptions, a comparison of approaches may lead to an                         
              understanding of unique signatures in the observables (e.g.,                   
              topography and geoid profiles, slab dip, tectonic environment)                 
              which could be used to predict the dominance or absence of physical            
              processes in specific subduction zones.
