Abstract    :
                    This SGER will support the urgent salvage of approximately               
              3000 rare and valuable bird carcasses recovered from the Exxon                 
              Valdez oil spill in Prince William Sound, Alaska.  The birds, stored           
              in four enormous freezer vans, have been held as evidence in legal             
              proceedings by the U.S. District Court for Alaska since 1989, but              
              are now scheduled to be destroyed on or before September 30, 1992.             
              Two basic reasons to salvage the Valdez birds are: (1) to complement           
              the world's holdings of rare specimens; and (2) to provide rare                
              material for important research on avian biology.  The Valdez                  
              seabirds represent a Spring sampling, whereas most seabird holdings            
              in museums are Summer/Fall.  Further, 11 species of seabirds in the            
              Valdez collection are represented by fewer than 100 skeletons in the           
              world's collections, and four of the species are listed as either              
              endangered or threatened.  Other species that the PI will salvage              
              can no longer be collected in large numbers to study morphological             
              variation.  Research projects made possible by the salvage                     
              collection include the study and recognition of new species                    
              (Red-faced and Pelagic Cormorants), the ecology of seabird molt, the           
              origin (which breeding colony) of winter and early spring seabirds             
              along the western coast, and growth patterns in seabirds.  These               
              specific studies will be cross-disciplinary, involving ecology,                
              molecular and morphological systematics, population biology, and               
              physiological ecology, and will enable a better understanding of               
              avian systematics, breeding ecology and conservation biology.
