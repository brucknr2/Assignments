Abstract    :
                   The objectives are to experimentally determine flow laws for              
              dislocation and diffusion creep of mono-and polyphase aggregates               
              of quartz and feldspar which can be reliably extrapolated to                   
              crustal conditions.  A key element of the study will be use of                 
              molten salt sample assemblies, which provide nearly the stress                 
              sensitivity of gas apparatus together with the high pressure                   
              capability required to induce dislocation creep in quartz and                  
              feldspar.  The results of this study should provide greatly                    
              improved mechanical data for interpreting crustal deformation, plus            
              fundamental understanding of diffusion and dislocation creep                   
              applicable to other silicates.
