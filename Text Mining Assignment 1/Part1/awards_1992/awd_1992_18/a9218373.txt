Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  Project Description (Technical):  This project will develop a             
              new measuring instrument, called a magnetic flux microscope, which             
              is based on a SQUID (superconducting quantum interference device)              
              sensor.  The objective is to obtain images of magnetic fields near             
              surfaces with a resolution at the micron length scale.  The                    
              instrument should be able to scan an area one centimeter on a side,            
              resolve features as small as 1 mm and sense magnetic fields as                 
              small as 10 December 22, 1992picoTesla.  The instrument will be                
              able to sense currents as small as 12 picoAmperes.  The new                    
              instrument will be used in investigations of superconductivity, and            
              will address issues such as the pinning and motion of individual               
              vortices.  In addition, the instrument will be used to obtain                  
              images of a range of magnetic materials, as well as working                    
              microcircuits.                                                                 
                                                                                             
              Project Description (Non-Technical):  This project continues the               
              instrumental revolution based on surface microscopy techniques such            
              as scanning tunneling microscopy and atomic force microscopy.  In              
              this case a new surface microscopy is being developed to sense not             
              atomic positions but the magnetic fields produced by the atoms and             
              molecules.  It will sense surface atoms and subsurface atoms as                
              well.  The sol-called magnetic flux microscope will be used to                 
              study superconductivity, magnetism and will also be used to sense              
              current flow in work microcircuits.  The technique should provide              
              new information about the fundamental aspects of superconductivity             
              and magnetism and will provide a new diagnostic tool to improve                
              microcircuit performance.
