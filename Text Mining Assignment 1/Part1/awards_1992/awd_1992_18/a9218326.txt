Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This award supports a two-year collaborative research project                  
              between Professor James McGuire of Tulane University and Professor             
              Michio Matsuzawa, The University of Electro-Communications, Tokyo.             
              Also involved in the project are Professor C.D. Lin of Kansas State            
              University and Dr. Mineo Kimura of Argonne National Laboratory in              
              the United States and several scientists from the University of                
              Tsukuba and Kyoto University in Japan.  The goal is to continue                
              research underway in atomic and molecular collisions.  The results             
              of the studies will be tested at several experimental facilities in            
              the United States, Japan, and Europe.                                          
                                                                                             
              The groups at Tulane and the University of Tsukuba will continue               
              calculations of double ionization of helium by photons to further              
              understanding of the dynamics of few electron atomic processes.                
              The groups at Kansas State and the University of Electro-                      
              Communications as well as the University of Tsukuba and Kyoto                  
              University will work on the structures and the dynamics of few                 
              electron atoms.  The groups at Argonne and the University of                   
              Electro-Communications will study the formation of doubly excited              
              states.  The results are expected to resolve some conflict and                 
              clarify understanding of the nature of few-electron effects in                 
              atomic and molecular dynamics and produce new computer codes useful            
              for evaluating properties of few and many electron systems.
