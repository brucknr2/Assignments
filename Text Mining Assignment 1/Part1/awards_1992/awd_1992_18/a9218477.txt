Abstract    :
              Single stranded RNA viruses contain both messenger RNA for protein             
              synthesis and an RNA template for replication.  Utilizing an                   
              experimental system which permits the study of each of these                   
              functions separately both in vivo and in vitro, the proposed                   
              research aims at characterizing the functional domains of the QB               
              replicase.  Such domains involve the catalytic site, RNA                       
              recognition and binding, and interaction sites for a variety of                
              host proteins.  Studies planned involve manipulation of viral RNA              
              sequences.  A second objective is the study of the viral nucleotide            
              sequences coding for the production of the QB replicase.  Chemical,            
              biochemical and molecular biological approaches will combine to                
              correlate the function of the viral genome with its primary and                
              secondary structure.                                                           
              %%%                                                                            
              The genome of single stranded RNA viruses is extrordinarily                    
              susceptible to mutation.  One consequence of this is a pronounced              
              difficulty in developing host resistance to viral attack.  Since               
              the viral RNA codes both for its replication and for synthesis of              
              critical proteins, it has been difficult to study these two                    
              activities in isolation.   The proposed research into the details              
              of the behavior of the viral genome is based on work in the                    
              investigator's laboratory which resulted in the development of an              
              experimental system permitting study of these two aspects of viral             
              genome function independently.  A variety of molecular biological              
              and biochemical approaches will be employed to relate the structure            
              of the viral genome with its ability to reproduce and infect cells.
