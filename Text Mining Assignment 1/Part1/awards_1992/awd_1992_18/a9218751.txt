Abstract    :
              It is proposed to study the effect of inter-particle short range               
              surface forces on the long range microstructures and structural                
              transition in dense colloidal dispersions.  Results of static and              
              dynamic light scattering, X-ray scattering and video-microscopy                
              will be interpreted using statistical mechanical theory and an                 
              inverse-scattering theory.  Stationary and sheared dispersions will            
              be considered in experiments.  The effects of colloidal chemistry              
              and microhydrodynamics on the structural changes and rheological               
              properties will be analyzed.                                                   
                                                                                             
              If successful, the research will have a broad range of applications            
              related to ceramic, surfactants and polymeric suspensions.
