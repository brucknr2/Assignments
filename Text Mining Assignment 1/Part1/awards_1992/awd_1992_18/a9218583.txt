Abstract    :
              9218583  Emslie       PI has excavated cormorant bone beds, which present an 
              opportunity to investigate formation of avian death assemblages in  relation of
              marine stratigraphy and taphonomy.  PI now will  complete taphonomic and
              paleontologic analyses, cooperating with an  invertebrate paleontologist (W.
              Allmon) and a palynologist (F.  Rich).  PI has generated a hypothetical
              scenario of mass deaths  followed by storms to concentrate bones.  Outstanding
              preservation  will also allow systematics study and phylogenetic revision of 
              fossil cormorants of North America.  ***
