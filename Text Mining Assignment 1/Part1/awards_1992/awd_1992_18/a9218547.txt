Abstract    :
              The objective of this research is to use the pore-pressure,                    
              temperature and displacement fields that are induced as a                      
              result of dike intrusion to provide important information                      
              regarding the intrusive process. The monitoring of induced                     
              fluid pressures have already illustrated the potential of                      
              determining dike location, volume and propagation rate. The                    
              monitoring of thermal and displacement signatures will                         
              provide complementary information to define the form of                        
              the intrusion, and may be used in isolation, or ensemble.                      
              The additional constraint that the ensemble data gives                         
              maybe useful in further defining the coupled processes                         
              that accompany intrusion, and maybe of use in predicting                       
              eruption. The program of analysis is a prelude to                              
              initiating a field monitoring experiment.
