Abstract    :
                   We will continue to refine the production rate of                         
              cosmogenic 3He and 21Ne by collecting additional samples of                    
              well-dated lava flows, and we will extend the production                       
              rate determination back in time by analyzing K-rich lava                       
              flows that can be dated using the laser fusion 39Ar/40Ar                       
              technique.  We will analyze these recent flows for 3He and                     
              21Ne to establish the production rate beyond 14C chronology.                   
              We will also measure 21Ne production rates in quartz and                       
              feldspar from Holocene and late Pleistocene flows.  In                         
              addition we will measure the 21Ne contents of co-existing                      
              minerals to establish the compositional dependency of 21Ne                     
              production.                                                                    
                   In addition , we will begin a concentrated effort on                      
              determining the mountain deglaciation at the end of the                        
              Wisconsin of two regions:  the western United States and                       
              Canada, and the southern Andes.  We will concentrated on                       
              volcanic terrains because 3He and 21Ne is quantitatively                       
              retained in volcanic pyroxene and olivine; plutonic terrains                   
              will be analyzed after we establish the 21Ne production rate                   
              in quartz and can separate it from nucleogenic 21Ne                            
              production in old (>20 Ma) plutonic rocks.  Western North                      
              America and the southern Andes will be studied because it is                   
              in those two regions that we have established the production                   
              rate of 3He and 21Ne (North America), and will extend it                       
              back in time (South America).  Such constrasting studies                       
              will help to establish the Northern and Southern Hemisphere                    
              ice sheets were retreating at the same time or not and if                      
              the younger Dryas is to be found in western North and South                    
              America.
