Abstract    :
                   This award provides one-half the funding required to purchase             
              an X-ray diffractometer (XRD) system to be installed and operated              
              in the Department of Geography, Geology, and Planning at Southwest             
              Missouri State University. The University is committed to providing            
              the remaining funds necessary.                                                 
                   The XRD system will be used primarily by students and faculty             
              of the Department of Geography, Geology, and Planning, as well as              
              other campus users from the departments of Agriculture, Chemistry              
              and Physics. Currently active projects needing the capability of               
              the XRD system include: analyzing the clay mineralogy of glacial               
              sediments in Missouri for stratigraphic ordering, mineralogical                
              studies of the Proterozoic granites of Missouri, soils studies, and            
              determining the effect of ionic complexes on the crystal structure             
              of clay minerals and their properties.
