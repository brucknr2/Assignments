Abstract    :
              This project is the continuation of an observational and numerical             
              study of the surface wind field of the Siple Coast, Antarctica.                
              the antarctic surface wind field is highly irregular, is strongly              
              affected by the surface slope, and has marked areas of convergence             
              and divergence inland from the coastal margins.  the interior                  
              provides large reservoirs of cold, negatively buoyant air which                
              produce a persistent katabatic wind system.  These convergent                  
              features appear to dominate the antarctic surface climate regime.              
                                                                                             
              This current phase of the project is based on observations made in             
              the confluence zone upslope from the Siple Coast, which offers a               
              different dynamical setting from earlier experiments in the Terra              
              Nova Bay region of East Antarctica.  In addition, the lower average            
              elevation of West Antarctica allows synoptic disturbances to                   
              penetrate more deeply into the interior and to affect the surface              
              outflow.  Specific tasks to be undertaken are to complete the                  
              analysis as the comprehensive data set collected under the previous            
              grant, and to analyze the behavior of the katabatic winds over West            
              Antarctica, as well as identifying how the observed changes are                
              forced by the synoptic circulation.  Numerical simulations using               
              several mesoscale models will provide the integrating picture of               
              the governing dynamics.
