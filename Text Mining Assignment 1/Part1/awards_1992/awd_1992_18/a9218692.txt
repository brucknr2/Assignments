Abstract    :
                   This award provides one-half the funding required for the                 
              acquisition of an X-ray diffractometer system to be installed and              
              operated in the Department of Geology at the George Washington                 
              University. The University is committed to providing the remaining             
              funds needed.                                                                  
                   The new X-ray diffractometer will replace an obsolete twenty-             
              year old unit. The characterization of materials by X-ray                      
              diffraction is a routine requirement in the research projects and              
              teaching curricula of the departments of Geology, Chemistry and                
              Forensic Sciences, as well as the School of Civil, Mechanical and              
              Environmental Engineering and the Materials Sciences Section at                
              George Washington University. The X-ray diffractometer will also               
              be accessible to regional users including undergraduate students               
              from the University of the District of Columbia and research groups            
              from the Smithsonian Institution.
