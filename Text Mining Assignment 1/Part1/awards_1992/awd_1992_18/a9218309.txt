Abstract    :
              This project will study algorithms and computational complexity of             
              combinatorial problems with an emphasis on parallel graph algorithms and       
              approximation algorithms.  Besides the more traditional area of                
              polynomial time approximations to NP-complete problems, special                
              attention will be given to efficient parallel approximations obtained by       
              NC algorithms.                                                                 
                                                                                             
              Such approximation algorithms are of interest to problems in P too.  The       
              P-completeness proof of the maximum flow problem shows that the least          
              significant digit of the flow is difficult to compute in parallel, but         
              it is open whether good approximations could be obtained in NC (i.e.,          
              for fast parallel algorithms).  This would imply a deterministic NC            
              algorithm for bipartite matching.  A seemingly fast candidate algorithm        
              based on least squares approximations is investigated, and its extension       
              to more general linear programming problems will be studied.                   
                                                                                             
              The work on the graph isomorphism problem will continue mainly by              
              investigating the performance of combinatorial algorithms involving only       
              elementary group theory; in particular, the performance of the k-tuple         
              coloring algorithm for selected parameterized classes of graphs.
