Abstract    :
              Mutations are one of the mechanisms by which bacteria evolve new               
              physiological and metabolic capabilities.  It is presumed that                 
              mutations occur randomly in dividing cells without regard to their             
              utility.  They occur predominately by mistakes during DNA                      
              replication or repair.  Recent evidence from extended nonlethal                
              selections suggests that under certain conditions the selection                
              itself can influence the rate or nature of the mutational events.              
              This referred to as adaptive mutagenesis.  It appears to occur only            
              during periods when cell growth is limited by some nutritional                 
              scarcity, which is a common and recurrent environmental condition              
              for bacteria in the natural world.  Currently, we know very little             
              about how bacteria genetically and physiologically respond to                  
              natural environmental conditions such as nutritional scarcity.  We             
              are using a combination of microbiological, biochemical and genetic            
              approaches to determine if mutation rates increase during extended             
              nonlethal selections and if the mutational events show preference              
              for specific regions of the genome.

              The information obtained from this project will allow us to decide             
              if adaptive mutagenesis is a general physiological response in                 
              Escherichia coli bacteria and will extend our knowledge of                     
              bacterial physiology in cells that are in a non-growing but                    
              metabolically active state.
