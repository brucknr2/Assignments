Abstract    :
              The discovery and mining of the Beal deposit suggests that                     
              hornfels mineralization may become increasingly important as                   
              a source of gold and as an exploration target.  However,                       
              gold-bearing hornfels are largely unknown to the scientific                    
              community.  The research will first establish the                              
              descriptive base of alteration mineralogy and host rock                        
              stratigraphy.  Then, by comparing the Beal silicate and calc-                  
              silicate mineralogy to non-mineralized hornfels aureoles, an                   
              occurrence model for gold hornfels mineralization will be                      
              developed.  Fluid inclusion and stable isotope analyses will                   
              constrain the fluid source, composition, and temperature of                    
              the mineralizing solutions and allow formulation of an                         
              overall genetic model with predictive power for other                          
              hornfels systems.
