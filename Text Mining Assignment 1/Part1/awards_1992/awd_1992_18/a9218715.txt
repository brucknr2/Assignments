Abstract    :
              Wah         This research targets efficient distributed computing  through
              intelligent scheduling of application programs.  The  approach has three
              components:  compiler development, measurement  of system loads, and automated
              learning of optimal scheduling  policies.  Compilers are modified to extract
              control and data  dependencies from applications programs, emit performance 
              monitoring code, and allow partitioning into processes with  predictable
              resource requirements.  A neural network model is  being developed to
              characterize system loads based on ready list  lengths, I/O traffic, and
              network congestion.  Finally, an  automated learning system will tune
              scheduling policies to  balance system loads using the predicted and measured
              application  program requirements.
