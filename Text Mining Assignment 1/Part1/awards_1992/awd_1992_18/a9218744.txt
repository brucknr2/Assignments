Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This award supports a two-year collaborative research project                  
              between Professor Carl Johnson of Vanderbilt University and Takao              
              Kondo of the National Institute of Basic Biology (NIBB), Okazaki,              
              Japan.  Also involved are Professor Susan Goldin of Texas A&M                  
              University and Masahiro Ishiura of NIBB.  The goal of the project              
              is to elucidate the molecular mechanism of circadian rhythms.                  
              Circadian rhythms are an adaptation of organisms to the regular                
              daily change of their environment.  Although much is known about               
              the formal properties of circadian rhythms that allow them to                  
              synchronize to the daily light/dark cycles, almost nothing is known            
              about how these rhythms work on the biochemical level.                         
                                                                                             
              Two approaches will be utilized.  First, the investigators will use            
              the simplest organism now known to express circadian rhythms --                
              prokaryotic cynaobacteria.  Second, they will exploit the genetic              
              tools available in this simple cell to analyze its mechanism.  A               
              major effort will be to identify the photoreceptor that is involved            
              by action spectroscopy.  This study will rely on the use of the                
              Okazaki Large Spectrograph and Dr. Kondo's video camera apparatus              
              to screen hundreds of colonies for specific manifestations of                  
              circadian behavior.
