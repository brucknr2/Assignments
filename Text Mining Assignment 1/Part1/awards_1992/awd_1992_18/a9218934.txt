Abstract    :
                   Two models are currently applied to large-scale                           
              mountain building resulting from compressional tectonics.                      
              One maintains that the processes in the construction of fold-                  
              and-thrust mountain belts are continuous and are everywhere                    
              at failure (the critical wedge hypothesis).  The other is                      
              that these processes are discrete and discontinuous, more in                   
              keeping with actual structural observations.  This work will                   
              attempt to reconcile these hypotheses by a finite element                      
              analysis that incorporates both structural and thermal                         
              parameters, to systematically explore different thrusting                      
              scenarios and to test the modeled consequences against                         
              relevant observations.  Results are expected to add to                         
              understanding of the process of mountain building.
