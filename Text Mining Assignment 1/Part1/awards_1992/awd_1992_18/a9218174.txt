Abstract    :
                   PI and collaborators (Greene, Wardlaw, Schweickert)                       
              will map, describe, and attempt to correlate Paleozoic-age,                    
              continental-margin rocks in roof pendants in the Sierra                        
              Nevada.  Issues to be addressed include:  a) geographic                        
              extent of continental margin rocks, b) original orientation                    
              of the margin, c) stratigraphy and depositional settings of                    
              outer-continental margin ("eugeoclinal") rocks and their                       
              relation to the "miogeoclinal" rocks in the White-Inyos, d)                    
              middle Paleozoic structural evolution, especially as                           
              sedimentary record relates to the Antler orogenic belt, and                    
              e) late Paleozoic and Mesozoic tectonic history of the outer                   
              continental margin, including effects of the Sonoma orogeny                    
              and truncation/displacement history of the margin.
