Abstract    :
              This US-Argentina Cooperative Science Program                                  
              award will support the collaboration of                                        
              Eduardo Fradkin of the University of Illinois                                  
              and Fidel Schaposnik of the University of La                                   
              Plata, Argentina.  The project aims to                                         
              investigate fermionic models in condensed                                      
              matter physics and field theory.                                               
                                                                                             
              The researchers will use non-perturbative                                      
              methods to study universal properties of the                                   
              wave functionals of conformally invariant                                      
              (critical) fermionic models.  They will also                                   
              consider the Multichannel Kondo model,                                         
              including the possible existence of states                                     
              with fractional quantum numbers in Kondo-like                                  
              systems.   The research has possible                                           
              applications to one-dimensional systems,                                       
              superconductivity, the fractional quantum                                      
              Hall effect, and the Kondo problem.  The US                                    
              side has expertise in theoretical and                                          
              experimental condensed matter physics, as                                      
              well as numerical simulations.  The Argentine                                  
              side has theoretical expertise, particularly                                   
              in quantum field theory, as well as                                            
              methodology for conducting projects in which                                   
              fermions are strongly coupled.
