Abstract    :
                   During a six week period in May-June 1991 the Cloud and                   
              Aerosol Research Group, University of Washington, carried out an               
              intensive airborne field study of the enormous plume of smoke                  
              produced by over 600 oil fires in Kuwait.  Rates of emissions from             
              these fires were: 2% of worldwide emissions of CO2 emissions from              
              all electric utilities in the USA, and thirteen times the soot                 
              emissions form all combustion sources in the USA.                              
                   In this grant support is provided to complete the reduction               
              and analysis of the large amount of data collected in the project,             
              and to archive the data set for other users.  This research will               
              emphasize characterization of the nature of the chemical emissions             
              from the various types of fires, the regional distributions of the             
              emissions, the transformations of plume constituents as they                   
              dispersed downwind, comparisons with other polluted environments,              
              and the effects of the smoke on weather and climate.
