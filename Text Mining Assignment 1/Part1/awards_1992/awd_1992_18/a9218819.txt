Abstract    :
              9218819  Rothman         The PI will develop and apply a number of simple models
              for  the simulation of complex geophysical fluids.  Phenomena of  interest
              cover a wide range of problems in multiphase flow,  including flow through
              porous media, phase separation and  hydrodynamics, sedimentation, convection,
              non-Newtonian fluids, and  granular flow.  ***
