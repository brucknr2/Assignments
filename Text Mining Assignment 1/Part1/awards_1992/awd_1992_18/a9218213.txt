Abstract    :
              This project will send a delegation of U.S. chemists to Russia                 
              as the guests of the new Russian Academy of Sciences (RAS) to                  
              seek ways to develop mutually beneficial research projects,                    
              personnel exchanges and other interactions. The visit will give                
              the American Chemical Community a better insight into the                      
              actual state of chemistry in the new Russian State. It will                    
              identify strengths, weaknesses, and grounds for collaboration.                 
              The delegation will make recommendations as to how to initate                  
              useful cooperative efforts. The results will be disseminated in                
              a report to the American scientific community.
