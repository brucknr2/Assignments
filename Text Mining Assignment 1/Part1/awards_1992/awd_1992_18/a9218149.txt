Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This award supports the participation of ten U.S. scientists in a              
              U.S.-Japan Seminar on Development and Future Dimensions of                     
              Structural Testing Techniques.  The seminar, which will be held                
              in Hawaii June 28 - July 1, 1993, is co-organized by Professor                 
              Stephen Mahin of the University of California, Berkeley, and                   
              Professor Tsuneo Okada of the University of Tokyo.  The seminar                
              focuses on three main themes:  technical aspects of existing and               
              emerging technologies for experimental analysis of structural                  
              components and systems, theoretical considerations related to                  
              test planning and execution, and methodologies and procedures for              
              documentation, dissemination, and sharing of experimental data.                
                                                                                             
              Among the topics for discussion are:  laboratory automation,                   
              advanced loading techniques, advanced instrumentation,                         
              advancement of data acquisition and analysis, fabrication of                   
              specimens, scale effects, rate of loading effects, establishment               
              of appropriate loading condiditons, innovative test concepts,                  
              dissemination of experimental data, correlation of experimental                
              and analytical data, and development of design criteria on the                 
              basis of test results.  This is the first meeting between U.S.                 
              and Japanese researchers in this field in nearly a decade.  It is              
              expected that the seminar will result in several new assessments               
              of procedures and recommendations on development of methods,                   
              facilities, and dissemination of information. //
