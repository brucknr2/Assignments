              The Seventeenth Fungal Genetics Conference, will be held at the                
              Asilomar Conference Center at Asilomar, California on March 23-28,             
              1993.   Approximately 400-500 scientists and students from around              
              the world will attend.  The conference is focussed on the molecular            
              biology, genetics, biochemistry and cell biology of filamentous                
              fungi.  The meeting consists of six plenary sessions, three poster             
              sessions, informal discussions, and a day devoted to concurrent                
              workshops in specialized areas.  Topics covered are sexual and                 
              asexual reproduction, genetic instability and variation, mechanisms            
              of gene expression, and agriculturally, medically and industrially             
              important fungal systems.  Strong emphasis is placed on the                    
              participation of scientists and students from under-represented                
              groups.
