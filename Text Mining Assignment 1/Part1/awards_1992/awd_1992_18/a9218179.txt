Abstract    :
                   The NSFNET today is a complex enterprise enabling millions of             
              researchers, educators, and students to communicate with one                   
              another, access a wealth of information on-line, and use the                   
              resources accessible through the network. While a great deal of                
              useful information is available on the network, finding what one               
              needs may be complex. An efficient network should have adequate                
              information resources and "road maps" to permit the user to                    
              navigate quickly and easily to the information which he or she                 
              needs. This project will (i) categorize and index the various                  
              information resources available into a Directory of Directories so             
              that users can more quickly and easily locate the information they             
              need, (ii) develop "white pages" and "yellow pages" directory                  
              services, (iii) develop a core Directory of Directories facility to            
              coordinate the directory and database resources of the NSFNET,(iv)             
              develop a complementary set of Directory and Database Services to              
              extend, supplement, and promote the evolution of available                     
              resources on the NSFNET.                                                       
                                                                                             
                   The Directory of Directories and Directory and Database                   
              services will initially be implemented using current Internet tools            
              such as "WAIS" and "Netfind" to permit rapid use of the services.              
              They will be transitioned to a fully distributed state-of-the-art              
              system based on the Directory standard (X.500) and, thereafter,                
              will incorporate newly developed research technologies which will              
              improve performance in searching large directories and explore                 
              innovative information gathering techniques to keep the directories            
              accessible, manageable, and current.                                           
                                                                                             
                   The project is one of three collaborative activities                      
              comprising the Network Information Services Management Project.
