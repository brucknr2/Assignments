Abstract    :
              The goal of this research is to elucidate the mechanisms of                    
              eucaryotic gene regulation. The system chosen for study is the                 
              yeast transcriptional activator ADR1 in its control of glucose                 
              repressible alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH2).  Particular emphasis will            
              be placed on defining the mechanisms by which ADR1 is regulated,               
              the functional regions of ADr1, the factors which mediate or                   
              influence ADr1 functions, and the means by which these factors and             
              ADR1 control ADH2 transcription.  A combination of biochemical,                
              recombinant DNA, and genetic analyses will be used.  The                       
              activation/repression domains of ADR1 will be precisely identified             
              and their interactions will be analyzed.  The mechanism by which an            
              ADR1 mutation enhances the function of ADR1 activation domains will            
              be examined by determining its effect on dimerization, ADR1                    
              conformation, and binding of other proteins.  The proteins which               
              co-immuneprecipitate with ADR1 will be purified and characterized.

              The goal of this research is to understand how cells respond to the            
              environment and control when and which genes the expression will               
              be characterized by identifying their important regions.  These                
              regions include segments that respond to the environmental signals,            
              that contact other proteins, and that turn on or off the express of            
              genes.  A combination of genetic, recombinant DNA, and                         
              biochemical techniques will be used.
