Abstract    :
              This award provides 60% of the funds required to modernize the X-              
              ray fluorescence (XRF) spectrometer operated in the Department of              
              Geological Sciences at the University of South Carolina. The                   
              University is committed to providing the remaining funds.                      
                   The XRF laboratory is used to obtain chemical analyses (major             
              and trace elements) of rock and mineral samples in support of                  
              research projects and teaching in earth sciences at the University             
              of South Carolina. It is presently using a twelve year old                     
              instrument which has been kept in a good state of repair. The                  
              modest upgrade supported by this award will bring its capabilities             
              to a level comparable with modern equipment.
