Abstract    :
                   Extinction, which may be the ultimate fate of all                         
              species, has always held a special interest for geologists                     
              and biologists, and even legislators (e.g., Endangered                         
              Species Act).  Extinction events, when a number of species                     
              become extinct over a geologically short period time, have                     
              always had historical significance to Earth scientists and                     
              evolutionary biologists, as they are conveniently used to                      
              divide up geologic time.  In this project, PI and students                     
              will examine in detail one of the earliest extinction                          
              events, at the Lower-Middle Cambrian boundary, and help                        
              answer questions such as how sudden the event really was,                      
              what percentage of the fauna went extinct, and whether                         
              species began to decline in numbers prior to their                             
              extinction.  The paleoenvironment in which these early taxa                    
              lived will also be reconstructed from the type of rock that                    
              now entombs them.
