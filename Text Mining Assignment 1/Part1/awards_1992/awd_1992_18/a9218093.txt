Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Lehigh University has established as a high priority the                       
              strengthening of its undergraduate chemistry programs in the area              
              of synthesis and diagnostics of advanced materials.  To implement              
              these priorities, Lehigh will develop a series of four integrated              
              lecture-laboratory courses leading to B.S. and M.S. degrees in                 
              chemical science for materials synthesis and processing.  The                  
              courses will be centered around nanostructure materials such as                
              fine particulate matter, thin layer materials, and materials for               
              future electronic and photonic applications, which are areas of                
              faculty expertise and existing facilities.  The program will                   
              include a student science seminar running throughout to get                    
              talented students interested in science, make them aware of their              
              career opportunities, and assist them in developing their                      
              individual and social priorities.  Ten-week student internships                
              involving research projects jointly supervised by Lehigh faculty               
              and industrial scientists are also planned for the summer periods.             
              The program will be continuously evaluated by the review committee             
              of the Chemistry Department and the Center for Surface Science and             
              through formal review meetings with a consortium of academic and               
              industrial scientists.  The program will be disseminated through               
              reports, publications, and computer programs describing course                 
              materials and laboratory experiments as well as through 2-3 day                
              workshops involving faculty, students, and industry.
