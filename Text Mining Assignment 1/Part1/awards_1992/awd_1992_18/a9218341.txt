Abstract    :
              Professor Sandner will launch an experimental investigation                    
              of                                                                             
              one of the most fundamental and important problems in atomic-                  
              physics:  the three-body Coulomb problem.   He will excite                     
              the                                                                            
              two outer electrons of alkaline earth atoms to very high-                      
              lying                                                                          
              Rydberg states so as to produce a positively charged core                      
              interacting with two negatively charged electrons.  The                        
              atomic                                                                         
              spectroscopy of these double excited states will be used to                    
              interpret the motion of the three-particle Coulomb                             
              interactions.
