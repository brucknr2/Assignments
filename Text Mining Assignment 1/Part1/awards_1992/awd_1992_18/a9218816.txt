Abstract    :
              This project deals with the dynamics of magma ascent in                        
              volatile-rich volcanic systems such as Mount St. Helens.                       
              Petrological studies of natural samples are used to obtain                     
              temperature, oxygen fugacity and dissolved volatile data for                   
              the preeruption magmas.  Projects planned for the next two                     
              years are:  (1) A detailed study of the magma dynamics                         
              during 1980 cryptodome formation at Mount St. Helens, (2) An                   
              investigation of the changes in magma dynamics in the same                     
              system over the 1985-86 period, (3) Experiments on                             
              plagioclase growth rates in wet silicic magmas in                              
              collaboration with K. Cashman, and (4) Magma ascent rate                       
              studies of two volcanic systems of contrasting composition                     
              and magmatic properties, the Moat Rhyolites of Long Valley,                    
              Ca., and the Hawaiian basalts of Crater Flats Nevada.
