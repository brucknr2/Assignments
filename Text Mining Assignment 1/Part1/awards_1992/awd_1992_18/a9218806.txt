Abstract    :
              This ongoing study will elucidate the physical behavior and                    
              chemical effects of fluids in the Earth's mantle by                            
              conducting melting experiments in silicate-carbonate-CO2-H2O                   
              systems relevant to the origin of  kimberlites and                             
              carbonatites.   The experimental projects proposed include                     
              ones addressing: liquid immiscibility between silicate and                     
              carbonate melts, the composition of carbonatitic melts                         
              produced from peridotite at pressures above 20 kb,molecular                    
              dynamics simulations of silicate-carbonate liquids, melting                    
              relationships of basalts-CaCO3, and high pressure                              
              measurement of carbonatite viscosity.
