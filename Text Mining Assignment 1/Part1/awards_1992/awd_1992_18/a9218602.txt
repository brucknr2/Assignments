Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Problem scale has a significant effect on the way that hydrologic              
              phenomena are observed and explained.  Recent hydrologic research              
              has clearly demonstrated that laboratory results may not adequately            
              reflect field scale behavior, that models developed at one scale               
              may not be valid at other scales, and that small scale variability             
              may have large scale consequences.  This research project is                   
              designed to help hydrologists obtain a clearer understanding of                
              scale effects and their relevance to practical hydrologic                      
              investigations.  It examines the complex relationship between                  
              natural variability and the models and data collection programs                
              that from the basis for scientific hydrology.  The first phase of              
              the project reviews stochastic methods for describing natural                  
              variability over a range of time and space scales.  The second                 
              phase examines new techniques for deriving scale-dependent                     
              estimates of hydrologic quantities.  The final phase of research               
              considers how field data can be used to improve the accuracy of                
              these estimates.  The stochastic approach adopted in the project               
              provides a way to quantify important scale-dependent tradeoffs                 
              between model resolution, sampling effort, and estimation accuracy.            
              This approach is illustrated with applications to groundwater flow             
              and transport.
