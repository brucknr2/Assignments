Abstract    :
              The proposed research concerns the role of water and                           
              hydroxide in nominally anhydrous materials.    The focus of                    
              the study will be on determining the "sites" of these                          
              hydrous components in the host phase, on correlation of                        
              species type and concentration with properties of the host                     
              phase, and on elucidating changes in these species among                       
              various geologic environments.  This will be accomplished                      
              through a program of spectroscopic investigations and                          
              computer simulations of  both natural and laboratory-                          
              synthesized silicate and oxide phases.   Results of the                        
              research should increase our understanding of the manner in                    
              which these trace "hydrous" components influence properties                    
              such as mechanical strength, optical behavior, dielectric                      
              constants, and response to ionizing radiation of the host                      
              phase.
