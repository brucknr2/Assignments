Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This award supports a two-year collaborative research project                  
              between Professor Richard D. Burkhart of the University of Nevado,             
              Reno and Professor Masahide Yamamoto of the University of Kyoto.               
              The goal of this research project is to evaluate the role of                   
              triplet-triplet annihilations as a viable mechanism of charge                  
              carrier generation in vinylaromatic polymers as well as small                  
              molecules present as molecular dopants in inert polymer matrices.              
              The polymers and small molecule analogues will be synthesized in               
              Professor Yamamoto's group, while transient absorption spectroscopy            
              on laser excited solutions and solid films of the polymers will be             
              carried out by Professor Burkhart's group to determine the identity            
              of any transients observed, looking especially for transient ions.             
              These experiments will be carried out over a range of temperatures             
              from 10K to ambient.  To evaluate rates of decay of the transient              
              species, nanosecond kinetic measurements will be carried out at the            
              University of Kyoto.  When both ion and triplet decay signals can              
              be observed simultaneously, it will be possible to determine                   
              whether or not a relationship exists between the formation of                  
              transient ions and the occurrence of triplet-triplet annihilations.
