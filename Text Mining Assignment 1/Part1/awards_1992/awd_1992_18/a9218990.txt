Abstract    :
                   Research in theoretical elementary particle physics will                  
              include studies of three-dimensional and high-temperature                      
              quantum chromodynamics (QCD) which will lead to an                             
              understanding of the low-momentum or infrared behavior of such                 
              theories; of high-energy and high-temperature electroweak                      
              processes, which will quantify the extent to which nucleon-                    
              number violation and other non-perturbative phenomena can be                   
              seen both at the Superconducting Supercollider (SSC) and                       
              as dynamical effects in the early universe; of string                          
              theories and two-dimensional quantum gravity, which will                       
              provide new and better mathematical formulation of current                     
              string-theory problems; and of four-dimensional quantum                        
              gravity and black holes, which will clarify the underlying                     
              physics of black holes with mass near the Planck mass (at                      
              which gravity is as important as the other forces).  QCD                       
              processes are known otherwise as strong nuclear ones, and                      
              electroweak processes drive atomic physics and some nuclear                    
              radioactive decays.  Together, these processes, including                      
              those involving nucleon-number violation, are the central                      
              focus of the experimental program at SSC and of processes in                   
              the early universe.  String theory is the underlying framework                 
              for all elementary particle interactions, including gravity,                   
              and the intersection of quantum mechanics and gravity takes                    
              place in the physics of black holes of mass near the Planck                    
              mass.  The programs to be worked on are central to the most                    
              important problems of elementary particle theory today.
