Abstract    :
               The project focuses on determining the computation power   of models of
              computation over the real numbers such as:   (a) linear decision trees;  (b)
              branching programs with linear tests; and   (c) combinational circuits of 
              bounded and unbounded fan-in with gates computing real functions, for the 
              computation of Boolean functions.  The latter models are also examined  from
              the aspect of approximate and exact computation of real  functions.  The goal
              is to prove lower bounds for explicitly defined  functions and to study the
              relations between different complexity  measures for these models.  This
              research could lead to new lower bound  arguments and it could contribute to
              the understanding of the  interaction between discrete and continuous aspects
              of computation.  In computational learning theory, extensions of previous work
              on concept  learning in on-line learning models are studied, as well as the 
              approximate learning of real functions belonging to classes defined by 
              smoothness or structural properties. In addition, concept learning   in
              structures of first-order logic is examined.   These investigations   are
              related to results and methods in PAC learning, information based   complexity
              and finite model theory.  Finally, another goal of this project   is to extend
              these formal learnability results to areas   often investigated in artificial
              intelligence.
