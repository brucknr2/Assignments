Abstract    :
                   The importance of atmospheric frontal boundaries to general               
              weather patterns has been known for some time and has been the                 
              subject of many studies.  Typically, frontal structures are several            
              hundreds of kilometers long and tens of kilometers wide.  Imbedded             
              within the larger frontal structures are features that range from              
              a few to approximately ten kilometers in scale.  Understanding of              
              these substructures is considered important to furthering our                  
              knowledge of the atmospheric factors that determine the exact                  
              location, timing and magnitude of mesoscale meteorological                     
              phenomena such as locally heavy precipitation events.                          
                   Using numerical models the Principal Investigator will                    
              investigate two important mesoscale aspects of frontal structures.             
              The first is to explain the phenomenon of the collapse of a frontal            
              surface to a very small scale.  This process is not well                       
              understood, but is important to understanding frontal structures               
              and evolution.                                                                 
                   A second avenue of research is the effects of topography on               
              fronts.  Again, this is an important area of research for                      
              understanding frontal evolutions.  The Principal Investigator will             
              continue his research as to how fronts are effected by mountains               
              under certain synoptic meteorological environments.
