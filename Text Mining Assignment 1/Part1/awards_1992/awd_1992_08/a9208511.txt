Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The proposed research is directed towards the synthesis,                       
              modification, and study of structure/property relationships of                 
              nonlinear optic inclusion materials.  Three thrusts are considered:            
              1) Exploratory synthesis of new nonlinear optic active host                    
              framework materials; 2) Nonlinear optic active host systems                    
              generated by selectively induced anisotropic stress coupled with               
              compositional driven phase instabilities; and 3) Nonlinear optic               
              nanocomposites synthesized by the self-organization and alignment              
              of hyperpolarizable atomic and molecular entities on the surface               
              and within the channels of polar inorganic molecular sieves.                   
              Exploratory synthesis using hydrothermal, flux, solid state, sol               
              gel and thin film techniques are proposed along with the use of                
              guest/host ion exchange, sorption, and solid state substitution                
              chemistry to modify nonlinear optic behavior.  A second objective              
              of this research is to examine atomic displacements externally                 
              induced by temperature and pressure and their relation to elecro-              
              optic related phase changes.  Inclusion guest and host chemistry               
              can be used to control second harmonic generation response over a              
              wide range.  The chemistry and characterization needed to better               
              understand this relationship will be studied and theoretically                 
              modelled during the proposed funding period and applied to the                 
              exploratory synthesis of new nonlinear optic materials.
