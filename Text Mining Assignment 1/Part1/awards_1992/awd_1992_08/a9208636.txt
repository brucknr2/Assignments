Abstract    :
                   The principal investigator will use a robust numerical                    
              technique based on the powerful mountain pass lemma to find                    
              multiple solutions of semilinear elliptic boundary value problems              
              and in particular to find those solutions which are not local                  
              minima.  A deeper theoretical understanding of the method and                  
              further expansion of the horizon of its applicability will be                  
              pursued.                                                                       
                   Solution structure is strongly dependent on the spatial                   
              dimension and the geometry of the domain.  The existence and                   
              stability of steady state solutions in the case where multiple                 
              solutions exist is extremely delicate and important in most                    
              physical situations.
