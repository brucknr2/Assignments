Abstract    :
              With support from the National Science Foundation, Dr. Ofer Bar-               
              Yosef and a large multinational group of collaborators will                    
              conduct archaeological research at the site of Hayonim Cave                    
              located in Israel. Hayonim contains deposits rich in lithics and               
              faunal remains - as well as fragmentary human skeletal material -              
              which span the time range of ca 160,000 - 120,000 years ago.                   
              Excavation and analysis will proceed over a two year period with               
              a series of related goals. Materials will be collected for                     
              thermoluminescence and electron spin resonance dating of the                   
              deposits. If successful this will provide absolute age estimates.              
              About 100 square meters of horizontal exposure will be obtained                
              to permit recording and examination of hearths and spatial                     
              distributions of artifacts and bones. Each of these classes will               
              be analyzed. Reseachers will reconstruct the lithic operational                
              sequences employed for tool manufacture and microwear analysis                 
              will be conducted to determine tool function. Survey will be                   
              carried out to locate raw material sources.                                    
                                                                                             
              Data from a number of sources suggest that anatomically and                    
              behavioral modern humans first appeared in Africa perhaps 200,000              
              years ago and spread sequentially to other parts of the world.                 
              The Near East, as the gateway from Africa may provide essential                
              data on this expansion. Work to date indicates that for a long                 
              span of time both modern humans and earlier "Neanderthal" forms                
              either coexisted or alternated presence in the area. Just when                 
              the first modern humans arrived however is unknown and Dr. Bar                 
              Yosef's research directly examines the suspected period. Hayonim               
              cave is worthy of concerted research because its deposits not                  
              only cover this time range but also contain well preserved faunal              
              and lithic remains.                                                            
                                                                                             
              This research is important for several reasons. It will provide                
              data of interest to a large number of anthropologists. It will                 
              shed light on the emergence of modern humans and increase our                  
              knowledge of a little understood period of time.
