Abstract    :
              Superconductivity and metallic behavior in thin films of doped C60             
              will be probed by studying their thermodynamic, magnetic, transport            
              and superconductive tunneling properties, measured in situ over a              
              wide range of temperature encompassing both the superconducting and            
              orientational structural transitions.  Fundamental questions                   
              concerning the nature of the superconducting coupling, inter- and              
              intra-ball interactions, electron density of states at the Fermi               
              surface, characteristic phonon frequencies, electron-phonon                    
              interaction, and the formation of the interball conduction will be             
              addressed through a series of measurements including specific heat,            
              magnetic susceptibility, resistivity, and Hall effect.                         
              Superconductive tunneling spectroscopy will be used to characterize            
              the strength and frequency dependance of the superconducting                   
              interaction.  Thin film deposition techniques will permit the                  
              exploration of metastable phases.
