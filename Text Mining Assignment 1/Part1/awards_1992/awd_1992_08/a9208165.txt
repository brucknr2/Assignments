Abstract    :
              In this research effort, the effects of pipelining on the                      
              performance of a high speed synchronous digital system are                     
              investigated.  Pipelining, coupled with the design of the clock                
              distribution network synchronizing the signal flow between each                
              data path, can significantly effect system performance.  Timing                
              characteristics of the clock distribution network are analyzed in              
              terms of how system performance can be either enhanced or degraded.            
              A graphical design paradigm relating latency and clock frequency               
              as a function of the level of pipelining are enhanced to further               
              study the performance of a synchronous system.                                 
                                                                                             
              Specifically, the following areas are investigated: 1) the                     
              application of localized clock waveform lead/lag relationships to              
              pipelined data paths so as to demonstrate the utility of these                 
              relationships and to understand their limitations for increasing               
              clock frequency in deeply pipelined systems, 2) the investigation              
              of the effects of retiming and register allocation/scheduling on               
              pipelined systems for application to behavioral synthesis and                  
              analysis, 3) the application of the aforementioned graphical                   
              approach to the analysis of clock frequency/latency tradeoffs in               
              structures containing feedback, thereby providing a structured                 
              theoretical basis for designing and implementing recursive circuit             
              structures, and 4) the investigation of the effects of process                 
              parameter variations on system level performance.
