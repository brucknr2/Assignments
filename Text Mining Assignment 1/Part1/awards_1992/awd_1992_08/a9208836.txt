Abstract    :
              This workshop is part of an ongoing                                            
              and worldwide effort to better                                                 
              understand the effects of surface                                              
              geology on the waves propagating                                               
              from an earthquake rupture.                                                    
              Specifically, this is being done                                               
              through experiments which consist                                              
              of two phases:  weak motion and                                                
              strong motion data collection and                                              
              model testing through "blind"                                                  
              prediction and analysis (that is,                                              
              the predictions are made in advance                                            
              of the experiment being performed).                                            
              The United States and Japan have                                               
              separately implemented experiments;                                            
              at Turkey Flat, CA and in the

              Symposium is to bring together                                                 
              researchers from around the world                                              
              who have made blind predictions

              individual and summary results and                                             
              analyses to:  1) develop insights                                              
              with respect to the effects of

              This is the first of two symposia
