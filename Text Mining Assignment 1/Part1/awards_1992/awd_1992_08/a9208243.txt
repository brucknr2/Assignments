Abstract    :
              Previous studies have shown that atomic clusters of between 2 and              
              500 atoms can be more magnetic than the bulk matter and exhibit                
              entirely new magnetic phenomena as the result of thermal                       
              fluctuactions, a large surface-to-volume ratio and finite-size                 
              effects.  This project will extend the measurements made on cobalt             
              and gadolinium clusters to a broad range of other metal, alloy and             
              metal compound clusters.  The studies will be made as functions of             
              temperature, magnetic field, and cluster size and composition.  The            
              ultimate goal is to synthesize clusters whose magnetic properties              
              will be useful in applications such as magnetic recording,                     
              electronics and optics.
