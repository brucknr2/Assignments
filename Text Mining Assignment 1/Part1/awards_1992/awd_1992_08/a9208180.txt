Abstract    :
                   Greenleaf will apply the theory of group representations to               
              problems in mathematical analysis on nilpotent Lie groups and                  
              their quotient spaces.  These investigations will seek a                       
              description of the algebra of invariant differential operators in              
              terms of the coadjoint orbits in the dual of the Lie algebra of                
              the group.  Initial efforts will address a basic conjecture:  The              
              invariant differential operators on the quotient form a                        
              commutative algebra precisely when the quasi-regular                           
              representation has finite multiplicities.  Success in these                    
              investigations will lead to understanding of solvability, and                  
              existence of fundamental solutions, for invariant differential                 
              operators.                                                                     
                   The theory of Lie groups, named in honor of the Norwegian                 
              mathematician Sophus Lie, has been one of the major themes in                  
              twentieth century mathematics.  As the mathematical vehicle for                
              exploiting the symmetries inherent in a system, the                            
              representation theory of Lie groups has had a profound impact                  
              upon mathematics itself, particularly in analysis and number                   
              theory, and upon theoretical physics, especially quantum                       
              mechanics and elementary particle physics.
