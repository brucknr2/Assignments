Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Their base is the substantial recent progress made in the                      
              understanding of cerium-based heavy-fermion (HF) materials, in                 
              terms of the single-impurity limit.  Their first thrust will focus             
              on the new characteristics that arise upon formation of a regular              
              Ce lattice, and how the thermodynamics and transport are affected              
              by inter-site magnetic correlations.  It is known that there exist             
              significant differences between the Ce and uranium families.  Their            
              research will concentrate on those aspects of U-based HFs with                 
              especially strong deviations from the single-ion, Kondo-like                   
              behavior of their Ce counterparts.
