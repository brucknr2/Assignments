Abstract    :
              The proposed state-of-the-art testing equipment will be used to                
              significantly augment the flexibility and capability of a long-                
              term research program aimed at providing a fundamental                         
              understanding of freshwater and sea ice physical properties,                   
              deformation processes, and mechanical properties. This                         
              engineering knowledge is required in the design of structures to               
              resist floating ice sheet impact, the transport and traffic of                 
              vehicles on natural ice covers, and the promotion of ice                       
              penetration and ice breaking. The equipment will provide means of              
              testing for thorough characterizations of ice microstructure,                  
              accurate specimen preparation, and data acquisition/reduction                  
              directed toward theoretical analyses.
