Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Funds are requested to support the travel of speakers invited to               
              the 51st Annual Symposium of the Society for Developmental                     
              Biology, which will be held June 24-28, 1992 at the University of              
              Washington, Seattle, Washington. This year's symposium is                      
              organized by Merton Bernfield, current President of the Society,               
              on the subject of "Molecular Basis of Morphogenesis". Each                     
              session will focus on a specific organ system as studied in a                  
              variety of organisms. Sessions will be on gametogenesis, early                 
              organogenesis, on root, flower and leaf morphogenesis, and on                  
              organ systems, including cardiovascular, nervous, muscle, and                  
              skeletal, epithelial and hemato-lymphopoietic systems. Two                     
              minisymposia will precede the main symposium by one day and focus              
              on "Inheritance Mechanisms at Fertilization" and on the                        
              "Molecular Embryology and the Study of Lung Development". The                  
              meeting is usually of medium size (300-400) registrants) with a                
              single platform session held at a time (25-30) speakers total),                
              and with 60-80 posters presented at three sessions. It is                      
              attended by graduate students, postdoctoral fellows, and senior                
              researchers. All speakers have been requested to prepare                       
              summaries of their presentations for publication in the annual                 
              symposium volume.
