Abstract    :
              This research involves the investigation of new                                
              designs in high-performance reluctance machines.                               
              The design methodology, finite element analysis,                               
              and a novel technique for studying energy                                      
              conversion capabilities are proposed to be                                     
              investigated.  A laboratory prototype model is                                 
              proposed for testing.  Vector current decoupled                                
              control of the machine based on optimal current                                
              angles for maximum power factor, maximum                                       
              efficiency, and maximum transient torque                                       
              operations is proposed to be studied and                                       
              implemented.
