Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              During the Phase II research it is proposed to develop travelling              
              wave electro-optic modulators for near infrared light using                    
              micrometer dimension, second order ferro-electric liquid crystals              
              (FLC) channel waveguides as the electro-optic medium.  Research                
              into channel formations techniques in low index polymer films and              
              FLC smectic layer alignment techniques for micrometer dimension                
              channels; electrode formation, optical waveguide coupling and                  
              radar frequency coupling techniques will also be carried out.
