Abstract    :
              The workshop investigates application and research issues of                   
              interoperating data and knowledge bases.  Multidatabase                        
              interoperability and resolution of semantic heterogeneity                      
              constitute enabling technologies for the development of complex                
              applications requiring access to multiple information resources.               
              The main objective is to bring together researchers from industry              
              and academia to discuss how the basic research addresses problems              
              encountered by applications in the heterogeneous database                      
              environment.  Participants have an opportunity to study real user              
              problems identified by the industry representatives.  The                      
              collaboration between basic and application researchers can then               
              be based on a solid foundation created by basic research. The                  
              main topics to be discussed include: semantic integration of                   
              information from diverse sources; methods to resolve semantic                  
              incompatibilities; query optimization techniques and distributed               
              transaction processing in multidatabase environments; descriptive              
              modeling of asynchronous data processing; and incorporation of                 
              emerging technologies (such as active and object-oriented                      
              databases) into multidatabase systems.  It is expected that the                
              results of the workshop will be summarized in a final report to                
              be published later.  The report will evaluate the progress made                
              in multidatabase interoperability and identify areas in need of                
              further research.
