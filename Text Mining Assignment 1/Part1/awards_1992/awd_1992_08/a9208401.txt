Abstract    :
                   The Principal Investigator will analyze mathematical models               
              for certain plastics and metals and will develop criteria to                   
              predict the failure of such materials under external forces.  The              
              types of failures of interest are those due to the formation of                
              microscopic holes which grow in size and combine to form cracks                
              in the material.  Particular problems that will be addressed are               
              the initiation and dynamic growth of a solitary hole, and the                  
              formation of secondary cracks upon the surface of a solitary                   
              hole.                                                                          
                   Mathematically, the proposed problems involve the analysis                
              of existence of singular solutions to quasilinear elliptic                     
              systems, the existence of, and admissibility criterion for,                    
              singular solutions to hyperbolic systems, and the existence of                 
              minimizers with singularities for problems in the calculus of                  
              variations.
