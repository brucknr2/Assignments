Abstract    :
                   The principal investigator will study a class of reaction-                
              diffusion systems which arise in modeling various reaction                     
              transport processes across compartmental domains divided by semi-              
              permeable membranes with special emphasis on multi-species models              
              with complex kinetics.  Such models arise in a variety of                      
              physical settings, with the most obvious example being the                     
              reaction-diffusion process within a finite chain of cells.                     
                   The investigation of the formation of stable spatial                      
              patterns through boundary feeds is physically realistic and will               
              lead to increased understanding to the development of spatial                  
              patterns in chemical models.
