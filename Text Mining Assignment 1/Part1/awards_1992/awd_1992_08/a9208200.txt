Abstract    :
                   The Bryn Mawr-Spelman Summer Mathematics Program is an                    
              eight-week summer research program for freshman and sophomore                  
              women from Bryn Mawr, Spelman, and area colleges, with the goal                
              of identifying and encouraging talented women to pursue careers                
              in the mathematical sciences.  The program would build on and be               
              modeled after a "pre-REU" program that has taken place at Bryn                 
              Mawr for the past three summers and would complement the Scholars              
              in Mathematics Program at Spelman.  Eight students would conduct               
              research whose primary focus is experimentation and exploration                
              using the computer; they would be aided by alumnae mentors who                 
              are just beginning graduate programs in the mathematical                       
              sciences.  Other features of the program include weekly                        
              roundtable discussions on issues in mathematics research and                   
              teaching, employment as teaching assistants in the students'                   
              respective departments during the academic year, travel to a                   
              national AMS-MAA meeting, encouragement to participate in an REU               
              or summer internship program the following summer, and mentoring               
              and advice regarding the decision to attend graduate school as                 
              well as the choice of an appropriate graduate program.                         
                   The Summer Program will be held for the next two years on                 
              the campus of Bryn Mawr College.  The program builds on and                    
              complements existing undergraduate programs at both Bryn Mawr and              
              Spelman Colleges and enhances an exchange program between the                  
              colleges that began in 1984.  It is anticipated that this program              
              would serve as a model for other early intervention and exchange               
              programs at the undergraduate level.
