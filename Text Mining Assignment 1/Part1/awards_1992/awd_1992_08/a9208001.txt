Abstract    :
                   This award is for a "Self-Sufficient Partnership for Research             
              Program" to be established at the University of Arizona's                      
              Industry/University Cooperative Research Center for Optical                    
              Circuitry.                                                                     
                   Optical circuitry is an emerging technology that has the                  
              potential for making major, if not revolutionary, contributions to             
              signal processing, communication and computing.  The I/UCRC on                 
              optical circuitry also called the optical circuitry cooperative was            
              founded in 1984 and is presently engaged in the study of optical               
              nonlinearities of semiconductors and organic compound; fabrication             
              and characterization of fast optical switching elements; growth of             
              novel MBE structures; theoretical and experimental studies of                  
              semiconductor lasers; investigation of optical interconnect systems            
              with free space diffractive elements and optical neural networks.              
                   At the present time 7 professors, 4 post doctoral fellows and             
              approximately 10 graduate students are involved in this research.              
              The Center has presently five members and will add a new DoD member            
              this year.                                                                     
                   The Center also plans to support a woman undergraduate student            
              who will be working on the measurement of optical nonlinearities of            
              fullerene materials.                                                           
                   Additonal funding is provided by the U.S. Department of                   
              Airforce to obtain a membership in the Center.                                 
                   The Program Manager recommends the University of Arizona be               
              awarded $50,000 for the first year of a three-year continuing award            
              and $5,000 for one year with funds provided by the Women,                      
              Minorities, and Disabled Engineering Research Assistants Program,              
              and $50,000 for one year with funds provided by U.S. Department of             
              Airforce.                                                                      
                   Near the end of each 12-month period, the Program Manager                 
              and/or the Division of Director of the Engineering Education                   
              Centers Division will review the progress of the Center on a number            
              of renewal criteria, including the following:  1) the extent to                
              which the university-industry interaction is developing; 2) the                
              extent to which the support base is developing; 3) the extent to               
              which a robust research program is developing.  If the review is               
              satisfactory, the Program Manager will recommend support for the               
              next period of this continuing award.
