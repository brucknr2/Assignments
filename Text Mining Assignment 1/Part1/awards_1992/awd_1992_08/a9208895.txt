Abstract    :
              This grant from the Organic Dynamics Program supports the work                 
              of Professor Scott Gronert at San Francisco State University.                  
              Ab initio theoretical methods will be used to characterize the                 
              transition states of several fundamental organic reactions.                    
              Gaussian 90 will be used to examine the mechanisms and                         
              energetics of proton transfer, E2, and SN2 reactions.  Bader                   
              electron density analysis will be used to examine how the                      
              molecular electron density responds during chemical                            
              transformations and how it shifts to stabilize transition                      
              states.                                                                        
              %%%                                                                            
              Theoretical calculations will be undertaken in order to                        
              determine the changes in energy during an organic reaction and                 
              to determine the three dimensional structure of any                            
              intermediates formed on the way to product.  The calculations                  
              will be performed on small molecules in order to limit the                     
              number of assumptions that must be made.  These reactions,                     
              however, can serve as models for more complicated systems and                  
              the theoretical results will give new insights into the factors                
              that affect these important reactions.  These calculations                     
              refer to the gas phase and will either confirm or question                     
              conclusions obtained from gas phase experimental studies.
