Abstract    :
              This research project will utilize                                             
              newly developed surgical and                                                   
              recording techniques to                                                        
              quantitatively examine the ontogeny                                            
              of inhibitory/facilitatory

              cell population.  The recordings                                               
              will be done in chronically

              techniques will be used to                                                     
              characterize the development of the

              These studies will shed new light                                              
              on the interactions which occur

              animal interacts with its

              postnatal period of development.                                               
              The results will provide new
