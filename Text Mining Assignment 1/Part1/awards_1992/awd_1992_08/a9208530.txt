Abstract    :
              The focus of this research is the synthesis of of an array of                  
              fully fluorinated compounds having skeletons with four to                      
              twelve carbon atoms.  Representative molecules contain                         
              conjugated pi-electron systems and polycyclic skeletons                        
              composed of small strained rings.  Studies of the compounds                    
              will include determination of product composition, kinetic and                 
              thermodynamic measurements and quantum mechanical calculations.                
              Comparison of the fluorocarbons with their hydrocarbon                         
              counterparts will shed light on the nature of fluorine as a                    
              substituent in organic chemistry.

              With this award, the Synthetic Organic Program is supporting                   
              the research of Dr. David M. Lemal of the Department of                        
              Chemistry at Dartmouth College.  Professor Lemal will focus his                
              work on gaining insight into the nature and chemistry of                       
              fluorocarbons.
