Abstract    :
              This Science in Developing Countries award will                                
              support a regional research workshop in the area of                            
              applied and computational mathematics.  The workshop                           
              has been organized by Professor Jose Castillo of San                           
              Diego State University together with Professor Luis                            
              Leon of the Universidad Central de Venezuela.                                  
                                                                                             
              The purpose of the workshop is to bring together                               
              practicing applied and computational mathematicians                            
              in the Americas to exchange information, foster                                
              cooperation, and promote the development of applied                            
              mathematics, especially in Latin America.  It is                               
              expected that the workshop will also lead to the                               
              establishment of applied mathematics societies in                              
              Venezuela and in other Latin American countries. By                            
              helping to bring together applied mathematicians to                            
              discuss a topic of increasing importance in the                                
              region, this award fulfills the objectives of the                              
              Science in Developing Countries Program.
