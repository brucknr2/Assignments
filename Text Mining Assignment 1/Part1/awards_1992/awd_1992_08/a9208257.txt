Abstract    :
              This U.S.-Mexico award will help to support joint                              
              research between groups headed by Prof. Nebil                                  
              Misconi of the Florida Institute of Technology and                             
              Prof. Alfonso Serrano of the Universidad Autonoma de                           
              Mexico, (UNAM) in Mexico.  The purpose of the                                  
              collaboration is to pursue studies concerning the                              
              environment around the sun.  Among the objectives of                           
              the research, the investigators intend to obtain                               
              information on the brightness of the solar corona                              
              and verify whether the sun has dust rings or a dust                            
              shell around it.                                                               
                                                                                             
              The investigators' experiment will include the                                 
              launching of a Viper-Class Sounding Rocket from the                            
              South Atlantic Ocean to observe the forthcoming                                
              (June 30, 1992) total solar eclipse.  This is one of                           
              the longest duration total eclipses of the sun in                              
              this century.  The rocket will carry scientific                                
              instruments built by the U.S. PI with various                                  
              components from Mexico.  Data from the eclipse will                            
              be transmitted to the ground and recorded on a                                 
              memory device for recovery by the U.S. Navy.  The                              
              experiment will obtain specific information on the                             
              dynamics of the dust particles orbiting the sun and                            
              the interaction of the dust with the solar wind.                               
              This information will help to increase our                                     
              understanding of the environment around the sun and                            
              other stars.
