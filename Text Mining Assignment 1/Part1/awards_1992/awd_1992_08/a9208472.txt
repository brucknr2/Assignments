Abstract    :
                   This Research at Undergraduate Institutions (RUI) grant                   
              requests support for Experimental Physics research by                          
              Assistant Professor Ganezer and his students at the California                 
              State University at Dominguez Hills.  He plans to extend the                   
              analysis of existing data from the Irvine-Michigan-Brookhaven                  
              (IMB) underground water-cerenkov detector.  He plans to search                 
              for evidence of solar neutrino interactions in the IMB data.                   
              He further will characterize the response of such water                        
              cerenkov detectors to low-level signals for future long-                       
              baseline neutrino oscillation studies.
