Abstract    :
                   The principal investigator proposes to work on error                      
              analysis problems in the area of asymptotic approximations.                    
              These include exponential asymptotics, coalescing saddle-points                
              in the method of steepest descent and for solutions of linear                  
              ordinary differential equations, and Airy function expansions.                 
                   Asymptotic analysis is used in many branches of mathematics               
              and hence in science.  The questions being investigated may                    
              reveal details of scientific phenomena not apparent to the casual              
              glance.
