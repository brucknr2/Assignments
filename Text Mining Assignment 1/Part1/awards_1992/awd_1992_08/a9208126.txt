Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Understanding the development of gender differences is very                    
              important to understanding human behavior. This award is being                 
              given for partial travel support of established researchers and                
              young investigators at the student or postdoctoral level to attend             
              an international meeting on the development of sex differences and             
              similarites in behavior. The meeting involves an variety of                    
              scientists from different fields and will give them unique                     
              opportunities for interactions with each other across diverse                  
              research areas. The information gathered in this conference will               
              contribute to understanding the role of gender differences in                  
              behavior at all levels, which includes personal, social,                       
              educational and workplace interactions in humans.
