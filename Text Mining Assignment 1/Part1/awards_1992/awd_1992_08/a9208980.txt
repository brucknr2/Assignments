Abstract    :
                Growing interest in sophisticated structures such as next                    
              generation composite aircraft and large space structures, places               
              increasing demands on the optimality of the structural components              
              used.  These demands are met by improving both the accuracy and                
              efficiency of the computational tools used to develop and                      
              analyze these structures.  However, the computational demands of               
              these systems are so great, that engineers must frequently be                  
              satisfied with rather crude and simplified models in order to                  
              speed up the design cycle time.  The true potential for execution              
              improvement lies in improved solution algorithms and parallel                  
              computing.  This interdisciplinary research program will focus on              
              the design of efficient parallel computational methods for the                 
              finite element analysis of such complex structures.  The research              
              includes three components:  computational mechanics, applied                   
              mathematics and applied computer sciences.  The first component                
              involves the development of discrete mathematical models based on              
              finite elements for representing aerospace structures as                       
              assemblies of beams, plates and shells.  The second component                  
              addresses the design of domain decomposition methods for static,               
              transient, and vibration analyses using those models.  The last                
              research component aims to tuning these methods to massively                   
              parallel supercomputers.
