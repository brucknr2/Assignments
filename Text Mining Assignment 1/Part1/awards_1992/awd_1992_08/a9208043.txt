Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              A fundamental problem in eucaryotic biology is the elucidation of              
              the molecular basis for the orderly creation and spatial                       
              organization of diverse cell types into a morphology specific for              
              an organism or developmental state.  The long term goal of this                
              project is to approach the problem via a molecular analysis of                 
              mechanisms that control cell differentiation and cell pattern                  
              formation during asexual reproduction (conidiation) in the                     
              filamentous fungus Aspergillus nidulans.  The functions of five                
              characterized regulatory genes interact to direct morphogenetic                
              events during conidiation.  Two of these, stunted (stuA) and medusa            
              (medA), are required to establish correct patterns of cell                     
              differentiation and the organization of these new cell types into              
              the aerial reproductive structure.  The specific goals of this                 
              project are: 1) to determine cis-acting regulatory elements                    
              required for transcriptional and post-transcriptional control of               
              stuA expression, 2) to isolate genes encoding trans-acting factors             
              effecting stuA gene expression, 3) to use antibodies directed                  
              against Stu A protein for biochemical characterization and in situ             
              localization, 4) to isolate genes whose expression is dependent                
              upon StuA function nad 5) to physically characterize the medA gene.
