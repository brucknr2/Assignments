Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The superior colliculus is a small, visual nucleus in the midbrain             
              of all mammals including humans and plays a major role in the                  
              control of visual orientation and visual attention.  Most of the               
              previous research to understand how it participates in these                   
              behaviors has been concerned with specific sensory inputs.  However,           
              the superior colliculus also has inputs from other systems not                 
              thought to convey specific sensory information, but which can also             
              influence the responses of collicular cells.  The most prominent of            
              these is the noradrenergic input which appears to have strong                  
              influences upon attention.                                                     
                                                                                             
              This research will examine how the  noradrenergic input to the                 
              superior colliculus modulates information-processing in this                   
              nucleus, including:  (1) which of the many different types of cells            
              are affected by this neurotransmitter, (2) the membrane and/or ionic           
              events associated with changes in cellular responsiveness, and (3)             
              the circuitry underlying the effects of this neurotransmitter.  Very           
              fine electrodes are used to record the activity of neurons in order            
              to assay the effects of norepinephrine on neurons.  Other techniques           
              being used combine immunocytochemistry and electron microscopy in              
              order to understand the synaptic organization of inputs to the                 
              superior colliculus.
