Abstract    :
                   The principal investigator will develop and improve methods               
              for studying the dynamics of pulses in nonlinear optical fibers,               
              providing a description of the behavior of soliton-like pulses in              
              several applications.  This study has the potential of providing               
              new technological applications for nonlinear optics.                           
                   The qualitative analysis of nonlinear waves for such systems              
              is of significant scientific interest in view of the wide spread               
              occurrence of such phenomena in real world situations.
