Abstract    :
              This Career Advancement Award will enable Dr. Mary Jane Shultz                 
              to shift her research empahsis from electronic-vibrational                     
              state specific reactivity to the less well defined area of                     
              reactions on liquid interfaces. The project will develop                       
              spectroscopic and molecular probes capable of examining liquid                 
              interfaces. Ionic species will be studied at the interface by                  
              second harmonic generation and by FTIR. Structural and dynamic                 
              parameters will be measured and interpreted in terms of how                    
              ions interact with liquid interfaces.

              This proposal develops a program which can provide new                         
              information on the interactions of gases with liquids. The work                
              is important because many environmental problems are related to                
              such interactions. The work can lead to a better understanding                 
              of environmental chemistry and to ways that such problems as                   
              air pollution can be minimized.
