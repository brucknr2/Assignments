Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This research examines mechanisms of plastic deformation in                    
              titanium aluminide intermetallic alloys, TiAl (gamma) and Ti3Al                
              (alpha 2), over a wide range of temperature and strain rates.                  
              Factors that influence dislocation mobilities are identified so                
              that mechanisms that contribute to plastic flow can be determined.             
              Two models for dislocation mobility are investigated: one looking              
              at anisotropy of bonding charge densities and its relationship to              
              dislocation mobility; the other at the role of non-planar                      
              dislocation core configurations on dislocation mobility.  A third              
              component of the study examines the variation in critical resolved             
              shear stresses of various dislocations taken from a number of                  
              potential slip systems.  This involves the fabrication of single               
              crystals so that stress can be applied along specific                          
              crystallographic directions.  Experimental techniques include                  
              transmission electron microscopy and high resolution electron                  
              microscopy.                                                                    
              %%%                                                                            
              This research adds to the fundamental knowledge concerning                     
              mechanical deformation of intermetallic alloys.  It is relevant to             
              the future development of ductile, strong intermetallic alloys for             
              operation at high temperatures in applications such as jet engines.
