Abstract    :
              This award is made by the Office of Special Projects in the                    
              Chemistry Division under the Materials Synthesis and Processing                
              Initiative. Organometallic complexes combining transition                      
              metals and main group metals will be synthesized to serve as                   
              precursors for Chemical Vapor Deposition (CVD) of                              
              thermodynamically stable and lattice-matched semiconductor                     
              interfaces for III-V compound semiconductors. Such interfaces                  
              are essential in forming active Schottky barriers or Ohmic                     
              contacts in solid-state circuits. The research will consist of                 
              organometallic synthesis, followed by CVD screening and                        
              characterization of the composition and structure of the film                  
              and the interface region.  Electrical properties will also be                  
              determined. Deposition of intermetallic films will also be                     
              attempted from the joined gas streams of separate single metal                 
              precursors. The composition of the films will be controlled by                 
              selective deposition of intermediate molecular addition                        
              compounds with Group III acceptor molecules.

              This research will provide fundamental new information on the                  
              formation and decomposition of mixed-metal organometallic                      
              complexes while also providing new routes to thermodynamically                 
              stable mixed-metal films on compound semiconductors.
