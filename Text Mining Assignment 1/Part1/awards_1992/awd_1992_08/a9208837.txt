Abstract    :
              This is an award to support research to determine the                          
              stability of viral nucleic acids homologous to the Human                       
              Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) under differing environmental                     
              conditions as encountered in primary, secondary and final                      
              effluents from domestic wastewater treatment plants, tap                       
              water and other aqueous fluids using the polymerase chain                      
              reaction method for detection of viral ribonucleic acid in                     
              samples being examined.  The investigators plan on                             
              determining the duration of the persistence of this                            
              nucleic acid after the virus has lost its ability to                           
              infect cell cultures.                                                          
                                                                                             
              This proposal was submitted to NSF under conditions                            
              outlined in NSF 89-85, Small Grants for Exploratory                            
              Research (SGER).  Results of prior studies reporting the                       
              presence of nucleic acids "homologous" to the Human                            
              Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) in wastewater concentrates                        
              suggest the importance of determining whether these                            
              nucleic acids are degraded after the ability of this virus                     
              to infect cell cultures has been lost.  This, in turn,                         
              would assist in assessing the potential of infectious                          
              viral transmission through environmental media.
