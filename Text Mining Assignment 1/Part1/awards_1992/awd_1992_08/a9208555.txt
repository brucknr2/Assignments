Abstract    :
              The effort explores a novel, relatively inexpensive,                           
              sacrificial anode process approach that can be used with                       
              standard plate-and-frame cells and avoids production of                        
              metallic-salt waste.  It is based on the electrooxidation of                   
              hydrogen gas using a fuel-cell-type gas diffusion anode in                     
              which hydrogen halide byproduct is evolved; it is necessary                    
              for this purpose to produce the hydrogen halide from the                       
              nonsolution (dry) side of the anode.  Cathodic processes                       
              include production of a variety of organic compounds with                      
              special emphasis on fluorinated products.                                      
                                                                                             
              The generic technology from this effort should be inexpensive,                 
              reasonably easy to use, have modest labor requirements, and                    
              pose few problems in separation of products or environmentally                 
              troublesome byproducts.  Initial applications are expected in                  
              high-value-added products in the pharmaceutical and                            
              agricultural chemical areas.                                                   
                                                                                             
              This is an award under the Joint Initiative in Electrochemical                 
              Synthesis sponsored by the National Science Foundation and the                 
              Electric Power Research Institute.
