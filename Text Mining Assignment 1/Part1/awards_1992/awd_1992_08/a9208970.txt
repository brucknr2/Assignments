Abstract    :
                   Support is provided for an International Conference on                    
              the Physics of Strongly Coupled Plasmas, to be held at the                     
              University of Rochester in August, 1992.  The conference                       
              focuses on the statistical physics of strong coulomb systems                   
              and crosses the fields of plasma, statistical and                              
              astrophysics.  The grant provides travel and subsistence for                   
              speakers as well as bare minimum general expenses for the                      
              meeting.
