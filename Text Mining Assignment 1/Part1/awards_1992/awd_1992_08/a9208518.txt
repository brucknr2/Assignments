Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This proposal suggests using a counter-diffusion chemical                      
              vapor deposition process to fabricate inorganic membrane                       
              composites consisting of an ultrathin inorganic membrane film                  
              and a multilayer asymmetric porous ceramic support. These                      
              membranes have the potential for high selectivity and flux in                  
              gas separations.
