Abstract    :
                   The principal investigator will study a mathematical model                
              for an epizootic which involves three species.  This model has                 
              applications to a plague epizootic which involves fleas, prairie               
              dogs, and coyotes.                                                             
                   Such investigations for determining the outbreak of plagues               
              are extremely important.  At the present time, plague outbreaks                
              among wild rodents are not predictable as to time and location.                
              The mathematical models developed with the help of experts in the              
              area of epidemiology and epizoology  have the potential of making              
              such predictions reliable.
