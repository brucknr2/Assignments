Abstract    :
                   Freedman has recently been concerned with applications of                 
              topology to other areas of mathematics, including geometry, ideal              
              MHD, and signal processing, as well as continuing his program in               
              four-dimensional manifold theory.  Thurston's geometrization                   
              conjecture is the most interesting problem in the latter area, and             
              the analytic tools for studying it, such as Hamilton's equation,               
              may now be available.                                                          
                   With the addition of a time dimension, the world we live in is            
              a four-dimensional manifold, which makes it that much more                     
              intriguing that dimension four is where various anomalies in                   
              manifold theory occur.  Freedman was one of the prime movers in                
              discovering these.  For example, in all other dimensions there is              
              only one differentiable structure on n-space, i.e. one way of doing            
              calculus, but in dimension four this is known not to be the case.
