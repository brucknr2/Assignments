Abstract    :
                   This award supports the research of Professor C. Greene                   
              to work in combinatorics.  He intends to investigate partially                 
              ordered sets, representations of the symmetric group and                       
              tableaux.  In particular, he intends to work on Young's                        
              seminormal representation of the symmetric group, Mobius                       
              functions on planar lattices, balanced tableaux, the lattice of                
              shuffles and a conjecture of D. Jackson on lattice-determinants.               
                   The research is in the general area of combinatorics.                     
              Combinatorics attempts to find efficient methods to study how                  
              discrete collections of objects can be organized.  And, so it is               
              extremely important to modern communications, for example the                  
              design of large networks as in telephone systems and the design                
              of algorithms in computer science.
