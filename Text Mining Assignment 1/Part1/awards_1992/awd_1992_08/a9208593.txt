Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The primary aim of this project is to generate pilot data on the               
              presence or absence of phytoliths on the dentition of Peruvian                 
              skeletal remains.  Phytoliths are plant substances which may be                
              found on the surface of teeth.  Phytoliths can be identified                   
              microscopically and are thought to be species specific.  Thus,                 
              phytoliths found on the surface of ancient remains may provide                 
              information on the dietary habits of ancient populations.  The                 
              investigators hope to identify maize phytoliths on the surface of              
              the Peruvian remains which would thereby allow future research to              
              track the changes in diet in some New World populations.
