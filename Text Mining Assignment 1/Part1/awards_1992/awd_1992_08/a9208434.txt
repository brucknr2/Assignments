Abstract    :
              This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation Program                 
              will help the Department of Chemistry at the University of                     
              Vermont acquire an upgrade of a 400 MHz NMR spectrometer which                 
              will be used in research investigations in the following areas                 
              of chemistry:  (1) the total synthesis of natural products, (2)                
              novel inorganic rings and polymers, (3) studies of                             
              chromatographic supports at the molecular level, (4)                           
              biologically active platinum compounds, (5) fundamental                        
              structural and conformational studies related to                               
              electron-transfer processes, (6) molecular sterodynamics, and                  
              (7) heterocyclic chemistry.                                                    
                                                                                             
              Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) Spectroscopy is the most                      
              powerful tool available to the chemist for the elucidation of                  
              the structure of molecules.  It is used to identify unknown                    
              substances, characterize specific arrangements of atoms within                 
              molecules, and to study the dynamics of interactions between                   
              molecules in solution.  Access to state-of-the-art NMR                         
              spectrometry is essential to chemists who are carrying out                     
              frontier research.
