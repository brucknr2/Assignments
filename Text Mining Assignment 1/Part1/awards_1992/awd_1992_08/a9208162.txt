Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Recognition memory is the type of memory in which people can                   
              recognize whether or not they have seen an item or experienced an              
              event before.  It is a basic form of memory, essential for normal              
              cognitive function; its absence is a sign of very severe pathology.            
              Recent work has shown that normal recognition memory is                        
              characterized by strong regularities that permit the analysis of               
              its underlying psychological mechanisms.  One such regularity is               
              that anything that affects performance on old items, items seen                
              before, such as increased study time or forgetting, also affects               
              performance on new items, those not seen before, in exactly the                
              same way.  For example, if forgetting is produced by increasing the            
              time from presentation of old items to test, an individual performs            
              more poorly on the old items, as one might expect, but also                    
              performs more poorly on new items; this is unexpected, since the               
              new items will never have been seen before the test and might be               
              expected to be unaffected by a delay preceding the test.  The                  
              symmetry of the effect indicates that the individual performs                  
              (though almost certainly not consciously) a complex analysis of the            
              state of items, an analysis of the sort expected by a particular               
              set of decision theories, including signal detection theory.  This             
              research will explore this regularity experimentally, as well as               
              related regularities, and develop a mathematical description of the            
              underlying decision process that produces the regularities.
