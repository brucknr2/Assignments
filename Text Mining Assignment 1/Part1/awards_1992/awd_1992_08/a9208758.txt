Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  This project will provide support for postdoctoral fellows                
              at the National Institute of Statistical Sciences (NISS), to                   
              engage in cross-disciplinary research with significant                         
              statistical research components.  Jerome Sacks is Director of                  
              NISS, located in Research Triangle Park.  NISS is a recently                   
              formed institute whose inspiration came initially from an NSF                  
              sponsored workshop on cross-disciplinary research.  Subsequent                 
              meetings in the statistical community produced a site selection                
              procedure and, ultimately, the Research Triangle site.  The                    
              creation of the Institute responded to the fact that in order to               
              address major national problems or "Grand Challenges",                         
              substantial progress has to be made in the methods and                         
              applications of statistical science.  A critical component of a                
              continuing effort in this direction is the involvement and                     
              encouragement of junior researchers.                                           
                   The present project will support junior fellows to work on                
              dedicated projects of high importance.  It will provide                        
              postdoctoral fellowship support for projects of a cross                        
              disciplinary nature.  The scope of the project is closest to the               
              role of the institutes in mathematics (IMA, MSRI, IAS).  However,              
              the outlook is quite different.  While the mathematics institutes              
              support postdoctoral fellows, their focus is on active                         
              collaboration with researcher from different disciplines, to                   
              solve important "national problems" which involve new statistical              
              research, in a manner fully consistent with recommendations of                 
              the Commission the Future of the NSF. ( See: A Foundation for the
