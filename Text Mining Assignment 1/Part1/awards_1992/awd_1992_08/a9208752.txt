Abstract    :
              The goal of the project proposed here is to                                    
              investigate heterojunction materials at liquid                                 
              helium temperatures in a magnetic field.                                       
              These materials have been shown to detect                                      
              millimeter waves in the 100-300 GHz range.                                     
              Very high electron mobility samples (>500,00                                   
              cm2/Vs) are particular interest.  Two such                                     
              samples have been received from IBM, and                                       
              other samples are expected through                                             
              cooperation with scientists in the United                                      
              Kingdom.  The project will explore how to                                      
              maximize the responsivity of detectors using                                   
              these materials, as well as attempt to show                                    
              mixing in such devices for the first time.
