Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              In Drosophila embryos, salivary glands arise from a thickened                  
              placode of cells in the ventral part of the labial segment. After              
              the placode forms, its cells are invaginated to form a simple                  
              tubular gland. Within three hours the cells of the gland are                   
              already differentiated and producing abundant, secreted products.              
              This simple example of organogenesis provides opportunities to                 
              examine the interaction between genes that establish the overall               
              pattern of the embryo and those that direct tissue specific                    
              development. Dr. Beckendorf's experiments have focussed on the                 
              role of embryonic pattern forming genes in choosing the location               
              of the salivary placodes and initiation salivary gland                         
              development. The goal of the current proposal is to identify                   
              additional genes that act downstream from the pattern forming                  
              genes to direct the morphogenesis and differentiation of the                   
              glands. Three independent approaches will be used to identify                  
              these new genes: analyzing enhancer trap lines, screening                      
              deficiency mutant embryos for salivary defects, and searching for              
              downstream targets of the transcription factor encoded by the for              
              head gene. These methods should identify a new set of genes that               
              will help him characterize specific steps in salivary                          
              development. Because of the short time between initial                         
              determination and differentiation, he hopes eventually to                      
              identify many, if not all, of the intervening steps in salivary                
              development.
