Abstract    :
              Johnson         This research is on developing formal techniques to  decompose
              higher-level system specifications into interacting  sequential processes.  A
              functional algebra is used for defining  formal representations and building a
              set of transformations for  manipulating them.  The notion of "interaction
              schemes" is the  central subject.  The project is composed of four activities: 
              1.     theoretical studies of the decomposition of digital systems;  especially
              formal derivation of control-synchronization and data-  communication
              protocols;  2.     automation of formal transformations which correctly do 
              sequential decompositions;  3.     integration of the mechanized formal system
              with available  CAD tools, and other reasoning systems; and  4.     application
              of the design system to meaningful examples of  digital-system designs.
