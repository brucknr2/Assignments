Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              A conference entitled "Symposium on Interactions of the Auditory and           
              Mauthner Cell Systems" held in Montreal, Canada in  August, l992 is            
              sponsored in conjunction with the annual meeting of the                        
              International Society of Neuroethology.  This conference brings                
              together, for the first time, an internationally recognized group of           
              neuroscientists who work on the neurobiology of Mauthner neurons               
              which trigger the acoustic escape reflex in fish and experts on the            
              auditory system. The conference enhances understanding of how these            
              two major systems interact and control sensorimotor coordination by            
              the brainstem.                                                                 
                                                                                             
              Proceedings of the conference will be published as a special issue             
              of the major scientific journal, BRAIN BEHAVIOR AND EVOLUTION.
