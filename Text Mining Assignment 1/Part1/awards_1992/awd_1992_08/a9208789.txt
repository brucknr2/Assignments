Abstract    :
              This project will seek a unifying                                              
              connectionist framework for the                                                
              classification of time varying signals                                         
              based on the gamma model proposed by                                           
              (de Vries and Principe, 1990, 1991,                                            
              1992).  The gamma model extends the                                            
              conventional additive model because the                                        
              multiplication of output activations with                                      
              weights is subsituted by a temporal                                            
              convolution, yielding a computationally                                        
              improved additive model.  This research                                        
              will have theoretical and practical                                            
              components.                                                                    
              New insights on the role of temporal                                           
              weights will be sought, using the theory                                       
              of recursive estimation.  Likewise, a                                          
              paradigm to study how the neural                                               
              network is representing the history of                                         
              the input signal will be sought, using                                         
              Hilbert spaces.  The gamma memory                                              
              projects a vector of unconstrained                                             
              dimension onto a predefined subspace.                                          
              This same principle will be extended to                                        
              learning, producing a backpropagation                                          
              through time algorithm that has memory                                         
              requirements independent of the length                                         
              of the input signal.                                                           
              As an application, the gamma network                                           
              will be implemented in a multiprocessor                                        
              system for speech recognition.  The P.I.                                       
              will contrast the gamma model with two                                         
              of the best available paradigms, Lang's                                        
              time delay neural network and Tank's                                           
              and Hopfield concentration in time                                             
              networks, in terms of performance,                                             
              network complexity and learning
