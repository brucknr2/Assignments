Abstract    :
                   This grant supports a program of experimental research in                 
              nuclear physics by a group at George Washington University.                    
              Experiments are carried out at NIKHEF, LAMPF, Saclay.                          
              Detector development for the experiments already under way has                 
              been done on-campus at George Washington University, and                       
              additional development work is supported under this grant for                  
              detectors for use at CEBAF.
