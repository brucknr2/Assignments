Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This project will study the nucleotide sequence data                           
              from one nuclear and three mitochondrial genes to test                         
              the monophyly of the Hystricognathi.  Africa and South                         
              American rodents that share a common masticatory                               
              morphology expressed in characters of the                                      
              zygomasseteric complex, the lower jaw and chewing                              
              musculature.  This study, which will apply molecular                           
              analyses to the problem for the first time, bears                              
              directly on rodent evolution and relationships, on                             
              critical historical biogeographic issues such as the                           
              origin, and pattern, mechanism and timing of dispersal                         
              of the South American Paeogene mammals, and on                                 
              paleontological issues such as the origin and                                  
              homologies of characters preserved in the earliest                             
              known groups of fossil rodents from the Paleocene and                          
              Eocene.
