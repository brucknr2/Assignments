Abstract    :
              This grant, under the Small Grant for Exploratory Research (SGER)              
              Program, provides funds to analyze electric field data that has                
              been collected in Antarctica, mostly at South Pole.  The goal is to            
              relate the electric fields to solar wind parameters, principally               
              sector boundary crossings.  The investigator believes that it is               
              possible that if the sector boundary crossings have a large effect             
              on the high latitude electric field, then that in turn, will effect            
              the global electric field, which then may control the formation of             
              clouds.  That might provide a viable mechanism for the much sought             
              "sun-weather" connection, a belief by many scientists that the                 
              variability of the sun is a driving force in the variability of                
              Earth's weather.  This is a very controversial and multi-                      
              disciplinary study.
