Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  This Research Planning Grant will be used to examine beliefs              
              about gender inequality in various domains such as employment,                 
              family, reproduction, and beauty.  The planning activities                     
              consist of development and pre-testing of items to measure gender              
              ideology, and further development of theoretical ideas about the               
              relationship between elements of ideology and social group                     
              membership.  The planning grant will provide resources and time                
              for the investigator to refine her theoretical model and her                   
              research instrument.  This will greatly improve the quality of                 
              the research proposal which is the expected main outcome of the                
              grant.
