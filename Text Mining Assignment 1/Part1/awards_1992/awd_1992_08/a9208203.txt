Abstract    :
              In this project in the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program                 
              of the Chemistry Division, William Chupka of Yale University                   
              will study the spectroscopy and dynamics of small molecules                    
              using multiphoton techniques.  The interaction of                              
              electronically excited states with dissociative and ionization                 
              continua will be studied with emphasis on the gerade states of                 
              molecular oxygen, which have the same symmetry as the ground                   
              state and hence are not connected to it by a single                            
              electric-dipole transition.  Selected ion-molecule reactions                   
              will also be studied using ions prepared in pure vibrational                   
              states.                                                                        
              %%%                                                                            
              The proposed studies will use multiple laser techniques to                     
              excite, probe, and ionize isolated gas-phase molecules in order                
              to obtain information useful for understanding and predicting                  
              the dynamics and interactions of many important systems, such                  
              as gas discharges.  These experiments can also be used to                      
              derive important information on molecular oxygen states that                   
              are important in atmospheric processes, yet which are difficult                
              to investigate in the laboratory.
