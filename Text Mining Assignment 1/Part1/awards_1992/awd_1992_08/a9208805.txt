Abstract    :
                   We are recommending support of Professor Ford's                           
              investigations into the relationship between quantum field                     
              theory, gravitation and cosmology.  One of the strange and                     
              critical problems which Professor Ford shall investigate is                    
              the effect that fluctuations of locally negative energy,                       
              permitted by quantum field theory, would have on the                           
              gravitational field.
