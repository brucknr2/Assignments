Abstract    :
                   This project will develop numeric measures and real-time                  
              graphical procedures for diagnostic use with regression models,                
              generalized linear models, multivariate data and other structured              
              data.  Graphical methods will combine parametric estimation and                
              kernel smoothers to make these methods useful and intuitively                  
              sensible beyond the linear model case.  Numeric case diagnostics               
              will be based on multiple subsetting of the data to extend the                 
              sensitivity to outliers beyond the single outlier-simple random                
              sample case.                                                                   
                   When analyzing data by fitting models, one of the most                    
              important tasks is to check for failures of the model to describe              
              the behavior of the data.  For linear models, for example                      
              multiple linear regression models, both numerical and graphical                
              diagnostics successfully identify aberrant individual                          
              observations or "outliers."  This research will develop                        
              diagnostics for the much larger group of models which are used                 
              appropriately for more highly structured or more complicated                   
              situations.
