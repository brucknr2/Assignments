Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This project involves the dissertation research of an                          
              anthropology student from UCLA who is studying the adaptation of               
              Laotian Hmong immigrants to California.  The project involves                  
              interviewing and participant observation of evolving gender roles              
              and awareness of the political situation they confront.  By                    
              participating in a gardening project and teaching photography to               
              Hmong children, the student will study their perceptions of                    
              changing gender roles and conflict management in work settings                 
              and their interaction with government institutions.  The                       
              underlying problem is to see which aspects of their traditional                
              identity the immigrants will try to maintain while adapting to                 
              new gender, work, and political roles.                                         
                                                                                             
              This research is important because the Hmong immigrants are a                  
              unique group, having migrated to the US in response to the                     
              Vietnam war.  Understanding the details of how they are adapting               
              to US culture and society will help policy makers deal with the                
              immigrant community at large.
