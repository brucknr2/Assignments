Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The primary objective of this research is to conduct a pilot                   
              investigation of the insertional polymorphism of Alu sequences in              
              New World human populations.  Previous research in the                         
              investigators' laboratory has shown that most nuclear RFLPs are                
              polymorphic in many human populations.  Here, the investigators                
              will analyze the utility of a second type of polymorphism as a tool            
              for reconstructing the history of human populations.  Because of               
              the wealth of knowledge regarding relationships between Native                 
              American populations and the availability of samples, the system               
              will be tested on this group.                                                  
                                                                                             
              Alu sequences constitute a family of related sequences scattered               
              throughout the nuclear genome which are capable of moving within               
              the genome.  As it is essentially impossible for a sequence to                 
              insert in exactly the same position through independent mutations,             
              finding identical Alu sequences insertions is presumptive evidence             
              of common descent. The investigators will test the utility of these            
              polymorphisms as genetic markers.  Additionally, the researchers               
              will investigate the antiquity of specific Alu polymorphisms by                
              comparison with samples from other human populations.
