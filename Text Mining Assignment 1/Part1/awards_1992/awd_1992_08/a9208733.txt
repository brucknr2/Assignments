Abstract    :
              The Snow-Atmosphere Chemical Exchange Working Group, an official               
              working group under the International Commission on Snow and Ice,              
              will convene a workshop in March 1992, at the University of New                
              Hampshire.  The objective of the workshop is to define particular              
              problems that currently hinder the quantitative interpretation of              
              proxy climate records that are being recovered from the Greenland              
              Ice Sheet Program (GISP-2) ice core, and to develop a research plan            
              for the continued utilization of the NSF-constructed camp at the               
              drill site.  This grant will provide support for the participation             
              of twelve American and foreign scientists.
