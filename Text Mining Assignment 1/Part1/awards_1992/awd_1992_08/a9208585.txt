Abstract    :
                   Real-life processes behave probabilistically and execute in real-         
              time.  This project will develop process algebra-based techniques and          
              software tools for reasoning about probabilistic and real-time aspects         
              of concurrent systems.                                                         
                                                                                             
                        o  Testing Preorders for Probabilistic Processes -                   
                           Testing preorders for probabilistic processes based on            
                           the natural notion of a process passing a test with a             
                           certain probability will be extended , and                        
                                                                                             
                        o  Axiomatizing Probabilistic Processes - An extension of            
                           the process algebra ACP to the probabilistic setting              
                           constitutes a complete axiomatization of probabilistic            
                           bisimulation for finite process.  Work will continue by           
                           considering recursion in the language, a weak version of          
                           probabilistic bisimulation in which internal actions are          
                           abstracted away, and the stratified model of                      
                           probabilistic processes.                                          
                                                                                             
                        o  Integrated Models of Probabilistic and Real-Time                  
                           Processes - The research will follow a dual approach to           
                           developing techniques for analyzing probabilistic and             
                           real-time systems by introducing time, in an integrated           
                           manner, into probabilistic testing preorders and into             
                           probabilistic extension of ACP.                                   
                                                                                             
                   A major outgrowth will be a suite of design tools for analyzing           
              algebraically the reliability and performance of systems.  One can use         
              this design environment to apply the methodology to substantive                
              realistic examples, such as communication protocols and distributed            
              resource allocation algorithms.
