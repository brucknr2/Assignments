Abstract    :
              The statistical mechanics of ordering in intermetallic alloys will             
              be studied by performing numerical simulations and renormalization             
              group calculations based on a model atomistic hamiltonian derived              
              from the Hohenberg-Kohn density functional theory.  The                        
              construction of the hamiltonian is based on the effective medium               
              theory of chemical binding which provides a simple yet accurate                
              description of the interatomic interactions mediated by the fermi              
              sea of electrons in a metal.  The specific systems to be studied               
              include copper-gold binary alloys and aluminum based transition                
              alloys which exhibit quasicrystalline structures.  We will study               
              both equilibrium and nonequilibrium phenomena.

              The proposed research will conduct theoretical studies of the phase            
              diagrams, including both equilibrium and kinetic effects, for two              
              classes of alloys.  The copper-gold system is a prototypical binary            
              alloy which is well studied experimentally.  The aluminum based                
              transition alloys are of more technological importance and are of              
              additional scientific interest due to the quasicrystalline phases              
              which can form.  The Principal Investigator has conducted                      
              preliminary work through a Research Opportunities for Women Career             
              Advancement Award.
