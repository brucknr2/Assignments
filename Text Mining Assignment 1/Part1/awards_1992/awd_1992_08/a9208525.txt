Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  Systems of human social interaction can be studied from                   
              various perspectives, one of which is rational action.  Under                  
              this approach, individuals are viewed as decision-makers who try               
              to maximize their utility through choices among behavioral                     
              options.  These decisions are based on limited information about               
              other people and events in the environment.  This project focuses              
              on n-person games, that is, on multi-person decisions where each               
              of the participants (or players) have interests that need not                  
              coincide with those of others.  The primary goal of the project                
              is to expand a new theory, called the central union theory, that               
              predicts outcomes in a large class of n-person games with a high               
              degree of accuracy.  An examples of an outcome predicted by the                
              theory are the probability that a certain coalition structure                  
              comes into place.  The prediction of the theory will be tested on              
              a large amount of empirical data from laboratory experimental                  
              studies of n-person games.                                                     
                   This highly theoretical and mathematical project will expand              
              and test a promising new theory about n-person cooperative games.              
              A very valuable aspect of the project is its emphasis on the                   
              ability of the theory to predict empirical outcomes, rather than               
              examining them only at the abstract level.
