Abstract    :
                   Theoretical research in elementary particle physics and                   
              astrophysics will focus on such problems as the role of quarks                 
              with unusual properties in the behavior of matter and the                      
              effects of intense astrophysical magnetic fields on the                        
              spectroscopy of the strongly-interacting elementary particles.                 
              Quarks with unusual properties are always a possibility, so it                 
              is important to know what effects they would have.  Intense                    
              magnetic fields may be associated with certain astrophysical                   
              phenomena, and their effects on elementary particle                            
              spectroscopy may help us to detect them.
