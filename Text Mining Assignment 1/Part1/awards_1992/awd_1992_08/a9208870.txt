Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The objective of this U.S.-Poland research project between                     
              Dr. Israel Wachs of Lehigh University and Dr. Jerzy Haber                      
              of the Institute of Catalysis and Surface Chemistry,                           
              Polish Academy of Sciences, Krakow, is to establish a                          
              unified, scientific understanding of metal oxide                               
              interactions at interfaces and the influence of these                          
              interactions upon catalysis.  The researchers will focus                       
              on supported vanadium oxide catalysts because of the                           
              importance of these catalytic materials, their use as                          
              model systems in the literature, and the prior research                        
              efforts of both investigators with these materials.  The                       
              results of this project will be an improved understanding                      
              of the nature of metal oxide interactions with oxide                           
              supports useful in attempts to modify the mechanical,                          
              physical, and chemical properties of solid metal oxide                         
              surfaces (e.g.: biomaterials, ceramics, coatings,                              
              electrodes, electronic devices, optical devices, pigments                      
              superconductors, and sensors).                                                 
                                                                                             
              This project in chemical engineering fulfills the program                      
              objective of advancing scientific knowledge by enabling                        
              leading experts in the United States and Eastern Europe to                     
              combine complementary talents and pool resources in areas                      
              of strong mutual interest and competence.
