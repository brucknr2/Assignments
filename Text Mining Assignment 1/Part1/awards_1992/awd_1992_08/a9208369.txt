Abstract    :
              This study is an international analysis of public attitudes towards            
              contemporary whale management and an assessment of public knowledge            
              about whales and whaling. Questionnaires will be administered in               
              the United States, Australia, Britain, Germany, Japan and Norway.              
              The research is intended to obtain accurate information about                  
              public attitudes on whaling. This information is essential for the             
              development of national policy decisions, and the formulation of               
              whale management policies by international bodies, such as the                 
              International Whaling Commission.
