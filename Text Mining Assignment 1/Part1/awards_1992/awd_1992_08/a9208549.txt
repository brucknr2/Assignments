Abstract    :
              This proposal examines inelastic deformation in metals and                     
              associated effects of fatigue and creep on structure evolution,                
              which, in turn, influences the deformation process.  The program               
              consists of three related studies: (1) reloading tests to assess               
              the evolution of structure as represented by the mechanical                    
              threshold and athermal stress parameters; (2) strain rate change               
              tests to study the kinetics of constant structure deformation                  
              during fatigue; and (3) stress change tests designed to                        
              discriminate between different theoretical treatments of creep in              
              dispersion-strengthened alloys.   Mechanistically-based models are             
              developed to provide quantitative descriptions of deformation.

              The primary goal of this research is to gain understanding of                  
              inelastic deformation processes in order to extend the operating               
              environments of existing structural materials, to develop new                  
              materials with improved properties, and to gain better control of              
              forming and manufacturing operations.
