Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              It is proposed to study the quasi-liquid layer (QLL) that occurs on            
              the surface of ice just below the melting temperature.  This very              
              basic surface melting phenomenon remains very imperfectly under-               
              stood but is of considerable importance owing to the dominance of              
              the water/ice system in nature.  The extensive use of the freez-               
              ing/melting process in the chemical industry adds an element of                
              significant technological importance.
