Abstract    :
              The objective of this proposal is to clarify factors influencing               
              morphological variation in plant roots by examining genotypic                  
              differences in root system structure and responses to soil nitrogen            
              (N) and water.  The infertile wild and cultivated accessions of                
              lettuce (Lactuca serriola and L. sativa) will provide a devierse               
              set of germplasm adapted to a wide range of soil water and nutrient            
              regimes.  Genotypic differences in root system structure and                   
              plastic responses to enriched soil microsites will be studied using            
              root topological methods and growth rate measurements.  Ability to             
              extract water, ammonium, and nitrate from enriched microsites will             
              be studied using the root topological method, growth rates,                    
              measurements of plant water balance including both direct (stomatal            
              conductance, leaf water potential) and indirect measurements                   
              (stable carbon isotope discrimination), and short-term labeling                
              with the stable isotope, 15N.  Improved understanding of                       
              environmental effects on root growth, including differences in                 
              response among genotypes, will provide a basis for improving water             
              and N absorption of cultivated lettuce, a shallow-rooted crop with             
              high demand for fertilizer N and irrigation inputs.
