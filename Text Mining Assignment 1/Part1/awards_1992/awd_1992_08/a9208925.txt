Abstract    :
              This high-field 250 MNz (5.86 Tesla) superconducting Fourier                   
              Transform Nuclear Magnetic Resonance spectrometer will be used for             
              high-quality, routine spectra and studies requiring long                       
              experimental times. Examples of programs that will make use are                
              involving synthesis and characterization of highly-branched                    
              dendritic macromolecules with micellar properties.  These polymers             
              have valuable solublilizing and catalytic properties.  Another                 
              program involves application of spectroscopic methods for the                  
              characterization of polymers, investigation of initiation                      
              reactions, and polymerization kinetics.//
