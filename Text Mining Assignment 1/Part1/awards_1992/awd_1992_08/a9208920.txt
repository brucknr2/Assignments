Abstract    :
                 This is the first year of a three year continuing award.  The               
              effort focuses on coordinated research in robotics, vision, real-              
              time AI, and real-time software systems, in the context of a                   
              robotic assembly testbed.  The emphasis is on flexible                         
              manufacturing automation involving active perception, planning,                
              and cooperative activities among agents in real time.  The                     
              project investigates integration of dextrous manipulation and                  
              vision, with cooperation among static and mobile robots and                    
              humans, and addresses current limitations of robotic systems in                
              dealing with uncertainties and rapidly changing environments and               
              tasks (such as occur in short-run production).  Activities                     
              include development of multiple resolution representations which               
              permit arbitration between local reflexive and global                          
              combinatoric strategies; studying tradeoffs between solution                   
              quality and computational speed in real-time systems; modeling                 
              cooperation and communication to achieve goal-oriented behavior;               
              integrating architectures and algorithms for extracting relevant               
              environmental information for control of distributed robotic                   
              manipulators; implementation of active perception to support                   
              model-based, goal oriented sensing for manufacturing assembly                  
              operations; constructing high level symbolic approaches to                     
              reasoning about geometry; and implementing learning mechanisms                 
              which model the environment based on experience over a general                 
              class of tasks to guide perception, planning, and multi-agent                  
              cooperation.
