Abstract    :
              This project is investigating the use of information about defect              
              clustering on wafers to make yield predictions for individual dies             
              based on test results for neighboring dies.  The hypothesis is that            
              defects on a wafer are clustered, thus most good dies are close to             
              other good ones and most defective dies are close to others.                   
              Clustering information can then be used for targeting particular               
              tests to individual dies on the wafer.  Simulations using wafer                
              defect distribution data from the published literature is being                
              employed to assess the viability of the approach.  Accurate models             
              to predict defect levels attainable are being developed and                    
              strategies for testing dies on the wafer are being determined.
