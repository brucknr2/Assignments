Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  A coupled mechanistic and non-mechanistic inquiry is proposed             
              to link quantitatively the elliptical instabilities observed in                
              boundary layer shearing flow to the optimal properties of a thermal            
              efficiency functional.  In earlier study, the extremes of the                  
              corresponding shear flow functional have determined a unique                   
              scaling and detailed average properties of turbulent Poiseuille                
              flow from boundary to boundary.  Preliminary results for the                   
              thermal functional reproduce the observed 1/4 power and 1/3 power              
              regions of turbulent convection at low and moderate Rayleigh                   
              number.  Here it is proposed to determine the consequences of                  
              optimizing the functional when the surface heat transport is                   
              controlled by the convectively induced shear flow, as in the                   
              geophysical arena.  Preliminary estimates of this extreme suggest              
              an asymptotic heat flux proportional to the half power of the                  
              Rayleigh number divided by its logarithm (as in R. Kraichnan's 1962            
              mixing length theory).  The proposed study can lead to quantitative            
              optimum fields of velocity and temperature free of empirical                   
              parameters from the range of current laboratory data to convective             
              flows controlled by surface turbulent momentum transport.  The                 
              comparison of the data with such results will establish the limits             
              of validity of the "efficiency" functional and its thermal                     
              generalization as statistical stability criteria.
