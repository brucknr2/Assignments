Abstract    :
              Yang         This is a supplement to provide a Research Opportunity Award  (ROA)
              for a faculty member at an urban undergraduate minority  institution.  The
              visiting faculty member is studying the caching  behavior of an interval Newton
              method for solving large systems  of nonlinear equations.  Both analytical and
              experimental  techniques are being used to determine the caching behavior of 
              several algorithms for solving systems of equations.  Caching  behavior is
              being studied on both existing vector computers and  on the new cache
              organization that has been designed by the  principal investigator.
