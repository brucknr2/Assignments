Abstract    :
                   The development of accurate and efficient numerical methods               
              for the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations is important for                
              the understanding of many complex physical phenomena.  The                     
              research proposed here focuses on developing such methods,                     
              implementing them on a parallel computer, and applying them to a               
              class of difficult problems.                                                   
                   The methods to be developed use domain decomposition and are              
              suitable for use on parallel processors.  The methods will be                  
              implemented on a Thinking Machines, Inc., CM-5 parallel                        
              processor.                                                                     
                   To demonstrate the usefulness of the methods, they will be                
              applied to a set of nontrivial test problems.  The test problems               
              will be computations of vortex shedding by either fixed or                     
              oscillating cylinders in uniform flow.
