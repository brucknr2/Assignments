Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This proposal is concerned with molecular orientation in the                   
              deformation and flow of liquid crystalline polymers (LCPs).                    
              Rheological equations of state will be developed to describe                   
              LCP flow, and several solutions for simple geometries will be                  
              obtained.  Molecular structure during flow will be probed                      
              experimentally by using dyes and particles for flow                            
              visualization in model flows in capillaries and between                        
              parallel plates.  Molecular structure during flow near                         
              boundaries will be probed by an evanescent wave technique.                     
              The evanescent wave technique is novel, and is particularly                    
              suitable to probing flow induced orientation effects near                      
              boundaries.
