Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This award will support study of the Japanese language by an                   
              American scientist or engineer by providing a stipend, tuition, or             
              other course-related expenses.  The objectives of the program are to           
              enable active U.S. scientists and engineers to acquire sufficient              
              familiarity with the language and customs of Japan to allow them to            
              function independently there and/or to acquire sufficient expertise in         
              reading Japanese to be able to understand technical abstracts in               
              their field of interest.                                                       
                                                                                             
              There is a critical need for more effective technical communication            
              between American and Japanese researchers.  This award is                      
              intended to help remove language and cultural barriers to U.S.-                
              Japanese cooperative research and to facilitate science and                    
              technology exchange.
