Abstract    :
                   This award will support a series of annual Workshops on                   
              Writing Skills for Young Investigators. These workshops will                   
              be held at annual meetings of the Institute of Mathematical                    
              Statistics or the American Statistical Association. The goal of                
              the workshop is to improve the technical writing skills of                     
              junior investigators by their interactions with senior                         
              investigators and editors of journals.                                         
                   This award will support a series of annual Workshops on                   
              Writing Skills for Young Investigators. The first of these will                
              be held in Boston, Massachusetts in August, 1992. There will be                
              two more workshops, one held in each of the subsequent years in                
              various locations.
