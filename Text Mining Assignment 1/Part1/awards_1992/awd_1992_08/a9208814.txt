Abstract    :
                   Ornstein and Katznelson will investigate problems in the                  
              following areas:  Groups of diffeomorphisms of the circle,                     
              application of "circle techniques" to twist maps; statistical                  
              stability; entropy, returns rates and data compression; Bernoulli              
              systems; ergodic and topological dynamic methods in combinatorics              
              and in particular identifying the characteristic factors of                    
              ergodic systems for given exponent polynomials; and regularity                 
              properties for maps of fractals.                                               
                   This project involves research in ergodic theory.  Ergodic                
              theory in general concerns understanding the average behavior of               
              systems whose dynamics is too complicated or chaotic to be                     
              followed in microscopic detail.  Under the heading "dynamics                   
              can be placed the modern theory of how groups of abstract                      
              transformations act on smooth spaces.  In this way ergodic theory              
              makes contact with geometry in its quest to classify flows on                  
              homogeneous spaces.
