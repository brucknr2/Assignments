Abstract    :
                   The principal investigator will continue his research on                  
              geometric variation problems. He will study stability and                      
              holomorphicity properties of minimal surfaces in arbitrary                     
              codimension, and develop existence theory for Lagrangian minimal               
              submanifolds of Kahler-Einstein manifolds. He will also study the              
              structure of harmonic maps into singular spaces of nonpositive                 
              curvature and determine general conditions under which the                     
              Bochner method can be used to establish rigidity theorems.                     
                   This award will support research in the general area of                   
              differential geometry and global analysis. Differential geometry               
              is the study of the relationship between the geometry of a space               
              and analytic concepts defined on the space. Global analysis is                 
              the study of the overall geometric and topological properties of               
              a space by piecing together local information. Applications of                 
              these areas of mathematics in other sciences include the                       
              structure of complicated molecules, liquid-gas boundaries, and                 
              the large scale structure of the universe.
