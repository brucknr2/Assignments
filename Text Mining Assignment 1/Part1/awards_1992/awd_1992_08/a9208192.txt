Abstract    :
              This research will focus on the synthesis of hindered bidentate                
              ligands designed to enforce unusual coordination numbers and/or                
              geometries around a metal (copper).  The work seeks to provide                 
              better models for understanding the chemical and spectroscopic                 
              properties of metalloproteins such as azurin.

              With this RUI award, the Synthetic Organic Program is                          
              supporting the research of Dr. Patricia S. Traylor of the                      
              Department of Chemistry at the University of San Diego.  The                   
              focus of the research will be to use hindered ligands to help                  
              understand the extraordinary spectra and properties of                         
              important classes of metalloenzymes and to involve                             
              undergraduates in a meaningful research experience.
