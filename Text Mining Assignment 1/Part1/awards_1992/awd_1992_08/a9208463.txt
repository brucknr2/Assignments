Abstract    :
              This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation Program                 
              will help the Department of Chemistry at the University of                     
              Wisconsin at Madison acquire a 300 MHz NMR spectrometer.  This                 
              new spectrometer is urgently needed in order to continue                       
              research programs in a number of areas supported by the NSF,                   
              including bio-inorganic, organic, organometallic, and polymer                  
              chemistry.                                                                     
                                                                                             
              Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) Spectroscopy is the most                      
              powerful tool available to the chemist for the elucidation of                  
              the structure of molecules.  It is used to identify unknown                    
              substances, characterize specific arrangements of atoms within                 
              molecules and to study the dynamics of interactions between                    
              molecules in solution.  Access to state-of-the-art NMR                         
              spectroscopy is essential to chemists who are carrying out                     
              frontier research.  The results from these NMR studies are                     
              useful in areas such as polymers and catalysis, and in biology.
