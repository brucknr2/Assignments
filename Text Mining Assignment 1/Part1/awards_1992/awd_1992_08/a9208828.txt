Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              A thorough understanding of the factors controlling nitrate pool               
              sizes is critical to minimizing such undesirable processes as                  
              nitrogen loss, nitrate pollution of ground water, and trace N-gas              
              production.  Using recently developed 15N isotopic dilution                    
              techniques that allow measurement of gross N-transformation rates              
              in relatively undisturbed soil, these investigators have provided              
              evidence that microbial assimilation of nitrate is a significant               
              component in the inorganic N cycle of three forest ecosystems.                 
              Although microbial assimilation of nitrate has generally been                  
              discounted as being insignificant in forest soils, they believe                
              that there is sufficient evidence from this and other studies to               
              indicate that microbial assimilation of nitrate may be a primary               
              regulator of nitrate pool sizes.  This project will examine forest             
              sites along two transects (in Oregon and New Mexico) and determine             
              the effect of heterogeneity in carbon and nitrogen supply on                   
              assimilation rates; the influence of temperature and moisture on               
              gross rates of inorganic N assimilation and production; the                    
              specific microbial populations responsible for nitrate                         
              assimilation; and the role of plants as sources of carbon versus               
              competitors for nitrogen.  This study will provide information                 
              that is necessary for the formulation of process-based models                  
              predicting the impacts of disturbance on N cycling as well                     
              predicting potential feedback loops that will develop as C and N               
              inputs to ecosystems shift during global climate change.
