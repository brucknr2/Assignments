Abstract    :
                   Field work necessary for taxonomic revision of the Hawaiian               
              carabid beetles (Coleoptera:  Carabidae) is underway, permitting               
              accurate characterization of the fauna and establishing baseline               
              diversity data for use in monitoring the status of endangered                  
              habitats.  Hawaiian species of tribe Platynini will be revised,                
              with over 20 new species described among the over 135 species.                 
              Identification keys and illustration permitting identification of              
              all Hawaiian carabid genera and Hawaiian species of Platynini will             
              be developed.  A cladistic hypothesis of platynine species based on            
              parsimony analysis of a comprehensive set of adult morphological               
              characters will be used to investigate speciation patterns in the              
              group.  Outgroup analysis using Pacific and Asian outgroups allows             
              identification of the source of Hawaiian platynines.  Characters               
              are examined in the context of the cladistic hypothesis, providing             
              information on their underlying evolutionary basis.  A                         
              comprehensive survey of adult morphological characters will be                 
              undertaken for Hawaiian species of tribe Psydrini, the second and              
              other major radiation of Carabidae on the islands.  This survey                
              forms the basis for a cladistic hypothesis for the group, and                  
              permits parallel tests of evolutionary process as accomplished for             
              Platynini.
