Abstract    :
              Improving our ability to design and construct high quality                     
              facilities will require technological innovations.  Research plays             
              an important role in originating innovations.  However, there are              
              many barriers to implementing innovations.  A major new paradigm               
              is necessary in order to stimulate technological innovations within            
              the Construction Industry.  One proposed strategy is based on the              
              creation of an "Institute" dedicated to the promotion of "                     
              Quality Constructed Facilities".  The Institute would serve as the             
              catalyst for research directions, and the development and                      
              implementation of interdisciplinary approaches to design and                   
              construction.                                                                  
                                                                                             
              The goals of the workshop are as follows:                                      
                                                                                             
              1)   To establish whether there is a strong consensus for an                   
                   "Institute for Constructed Systems".                                      
                                                                                             
              2)   To explore the role of the proposed institute within the                  
                   National Science Foundation and the Civil Engineering                     
                   Profession.                                                               
                                                                                             
              3)   To explore how the Institute could be implemented and funded.
