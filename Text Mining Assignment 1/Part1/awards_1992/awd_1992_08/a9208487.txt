Abstract    :
              Karpovsky         This research focuses on the development of a unified 
              framework for combining on-line and off-line error detection  mechanisms at
              both the chip and board levels.  This framework  includes:  concurrent checking
              of the device for on-line  detection, space and time compression of test
              responses, analysis  of distortions in the resulting signatures for error
              detection  and diagnosis for built-in self-testing (BIST), and concurrent 
              checking of hardware required for (BIST).
