Abstract    :
              The Fellow will examine the theoretical development of                         
              thermodynamic equations of state for surface complexes in order                
              to determine whether the primary mode of geochemical mass                      
              transfer is by partitioning of species between aqueous solutions               
              and minerals through the formation of chemical bonds at the                    
              surfaces.  Development of a thermodynamic model for surface                    
              complexes will focus on a number of oxides and silicates.  Models              
              will then be extended to include other classes of aqueous species              
              and minerals and tested with available experimental data.  The                 
              Fellow has chosen to conduct her fellowship tenure at the                      
              University of California at Berkeley.
