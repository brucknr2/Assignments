Abstract    :
              X-ray measurements provide non-destructive structural information              
              for many materials systems.  High resolution diffraction                       
              measurements determine sample perfection, compositional and strain             
              modulation, and interface abruptness over a few atomic planes.  X-             
              ray reflectivity measurements address electron density modulations             
              and interface roughness in thin film systems.  Such issues are                 
              highly relevant to the growth and processing of semiconductor                  
              epitaxial heterostructures, device structures, and bulk materials.             
              Physical information, including the effect of strain and materials             
              perfection on optical and electronic properties, are also                      
              quantitatively determined.  In other fields, these techniques                  
              enhance the study of coherency strains in superalloys and of                   
              ceramic thin films deposited by sol-gel methods.  In this project,             
              we will develop a high resolution x-ray diffraction/scattering                 
              characterization facility with both high and low temperature                   
              stages.  The facility shall include wafer mapping capabilities and             
              simulation software.  Major research proposals involving Si1icon-              
              germanium multi-layers and device structures, the growth kinetics              
              and structural properties of HgCdTe, the relationship between                  
              strain and optical and transport properties in III-V multi-layers,             
              and misfit strain in precipitation hardened superalloys are                    
              presented.
