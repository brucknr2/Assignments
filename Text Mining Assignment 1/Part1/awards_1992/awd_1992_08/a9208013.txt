Abstract    :
                   Professor Smedley will measure energy transfer between                    
              excited atoms using time- and wavelength-resolved fluorescence                 
              spectroscopy.  The emission profiles will reveal the delicate                  
              interplay between collisional and light field interaction when                 
              atoms absorb light energy in the presence of perturbing partners.              
              This project will be carried out within the context of the RUI                 
              (Research at Undergraduate Institutions) program and will expose               
              several undergraduates to a physics research environment.
