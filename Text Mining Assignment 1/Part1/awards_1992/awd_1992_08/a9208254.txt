Abstract    :
              The objective is to design new, conformationally homogeneous,                  
              enantioselective receptors for functionalized, chiral organic                  
              molecules such as peptides.  The receptors, that will be                       
              synthesized from readily available materials, are expected to                  
              show high distinctions between enantiomeric guests, based on                   
              previous work.  Such molecules may form the basis of a                         
              practical resolution method based on chiral polymer beads and                  
              simple filtration.  The binding data collected will also be                    
              valuable for testing the computational methods for predicting                  
              binding properties.  Such predictions are crucial for truly                    
              rational molecular design.  To use free energy simulations for                 
              reliable predictions, recent results suggest that impractically                
              long simulations may be necessary.  Consequently, new methods                  
              will be designed to accelerate dramatically the convergence to                 
              stable free energies.  These enhancements will include the                     
              development of useful and more realistic continuum solvation                   
              models, and mixed dynamics/Monte Carlo simulation methods.

              With this award, the Organic Synthesis Program will support the                
              research of Dr. W. Clark Still at Columbia University.  The                    
              synthesis of enantioselective receptors will be undertaken,                    
              guided by theoretical considerations.  This will allow the                     
              chemist to separate the mirror image forms of chiral molecules.                
              The ability to do this systematically on a large scale will                    
              provide an important tool to synthesize the increasingly                       
              complex substances needed in biochemistry and medicine, as will                
              as in the chemical industry.
