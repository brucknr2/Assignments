Abstract    :
              Anomalous deposition of alloys is defined by the less noble                    
              metal depositing preferentially to the more noble metal under                  
              certain conditions.  This project aims to understand the                       
              mechanism of anomalous codeposition in plating processes using                 
              experiments and mathematical modelling.  Previous work on the                  
              codeposition of nickel-iron suggests that change transfer in                   
              the monohydroxide species causes the anomaly; this work                        
              ascertains whether or not this mechanism can be extended to                    
              explain anomalous codeposition of the mutual alloys of nickel                  
              iron, cobalt, and zinc.  The effect of buffering the pH of the                 
              plating bath is also  investigated.  Mathematical modelling                    
              consists of two parts:  equilibrium calculations and one-                      
              dimensional diffusion modelling which includes the effects of                  
              buffering and of hydrolysis reactions.                                         
                                                                                             
              This phenomenon is most commonly encountered with the mutual                   
              alloys of iron, cobalt, nickel, and zinc.  These alloys are                    
              widely used in electroplated films because of their high                       
              strength, hardness, and magnetic properties.  Electrodeposited                 
              zinc-nickel provides corrosion protection for steel; high-iron                 
              nickel-iron (such as Invar) is used where low thermal                          
              expansion is required including microwave guides. optics.                      
              laser housings, and printed circuit boards; ferromagnetic                      
              alloys such as cobalt-nickel, iron-cobalt, and nickel-iron are                 
              widely used in electronic and magnetic devices including                       
              computer memory, magnetic shielding, and magnetic recording
