Abstract    :
              The study of fundamental defects in amorphous semiconductors is to             
              be undertaken in four general areas of activity.  The proposed work            
              will investigate the nature of the D defect in its different                   
              relaxed and unrelaxed states using spin transient measurements and             
              in intrinsic a-Si:H using capacitive transient methods.  Doping                
              multilayers will be investigated to study contamination effects and            
              electron trapping into thin regions of the lower gap material.  The            
              nature of the c-Si/a-Si:H interface will be examined to understand             
              the effects of the substrate on the a-Si:H electronic structure in             
              the near interface region.  The distribution of interface defects              
              will be correlated with ESR and opitcal generation studies.  The               
              defect density will be determined in semiconducting transition                 
              metal chalcogenides to help develop samples with optimized                     
              electronic properties.
