Abstract    :
                   The research will examine patterns of herbivory in host                   
              hybrid zones.  Three related projects are proposed that will                   
              elucidate for a gall wasp-leaf miner-oak system: 1) the genetic                
                                                                                             
              structure of oak hybrid zones, 2) patterns of herbivore density                
                                                                                             
              and species diversity in a variety of hybrid combinations, and 3)              
                                                                                             
              mechanisms responsible for variation in herbivore loads between                
                                                                                             
              host taxa within oak hybrid zones.  A combination of correlative,              
                                                                                             
              experimental, and molecular genetic approaches are proposed. The               
                                                                                             
              correlative and experimental analyses are designed to test three               
                                                                                             
              mutually exclusive hypotheses regarding patterns of herbivory in               
                                                                                             
              host hybrid zones. The genetic analysis will introduce a new                   
              technique to plant-insect ecology, RAPD (for Random Amplified                  
              Polymorphic DNA), that will distinguish among three competing                  
              models of introgressive hybridization and host susceptibility to               
                                                                                             
              parasites.  The work has important implications for the                        
              introduction of hybrid and genetically engineered agricultural                 
                                                                                             
              crops, and for the conservation of endangered species threatened
