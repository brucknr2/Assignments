Abstract    :
              This project will support improved housing and curation of the                 
              botanical collections at the University of Massachusetts                       
              herbarium, which includes two herbaria: Amherst College                        
              Herbarium, one of the oldest in the country and Massachusetts                  
              State, both of which have collections of historical importance                 
              that are strong in New England plants, especially from western                 
              Massachusetts.  New cabinets will replace older wooden ones which              
              are no longer adequate to prevent infestation and serious damage               
              to this important regional collection.  Also a backlog of                      
              important specimens will be mounted and added to the main                      
              collection.  Both improvements will increase access to the                     
              collection by students and researchers involved in biodiversity                
              and conservation studies.
