Abstract    :
              This projedct is for participant expenses for thed First                       
              International Conference on Substorms (ICS) to be held in Kiruna,              
              Sweden on March 23-27, 1992.  This ICS has been organized by the               
              Swedish Institute of Space Physics and the second ICS will be                  
              held in Fairbanks, Alaska in 1994.  Sessions will include (1) the              
              ground state of the magnetosphere, (2) thed loading phase and the              
              relation of substorm processes between the low-altitude auroral                
              region and the magnetosphere, (3) substorm expansion phase, (4)                
              substorm recovery phases, (5) substorm-like phenomena at other                 
              bodies of the solar system, and (6) and substorm models.  This                 
              international conference is especially timely now due to current               
              and forthcoming programs of the Solar Terrestrial Energy Program               
              (STEP) which involves 4500 participants in 42 countries, and                   
              pacecraft projects of the Interagency Consultative Group (IACG).               
              The substorm problem is a central one in these international                   
              programs and this conference will help to provide a renewed focus              
              on the key scientific questions.
