Abstract    :
              This project will have four parts.  The first part seeks to                    
              improve the running time of algorithms to compute the volumes                  
              of convex sets, to do multivariate sampling and integration.                   
              Randomized polynomial time algorithms for these problems using                 
              rapidly mixing Markov Chains have been used; some new ones                     
              will be designed that are ultimately intended to render these                  
              theoretically polynomial time bounded algorithms usable in                     
              practice.  The second part considers some general results on                   
              log-concave functions that will reduce the running time of                     
              sampling according to such functions; most statistical                         
              distributions belong to this class.  The third section                         
              considers some problems arising in Manufacturing where, one                    
              has to optimize (minimize)the cost of components (raw                          
              materials) subject to the (chance) constraint that one has                     
              enough components to make the probability of our being able to                 
              meet the stochastic demands high enough.  The last part                        
              considers Parametric Integer Programming which arises in                       
              contexts where the constraint matrix of an integer program                     
              remains fixed and one wishes to solve the problem for various                  
              right hand side vectors.  Algorithms to preprocess the                         
              constraint matrix with a parallel algorithm will be                            
              considered.
