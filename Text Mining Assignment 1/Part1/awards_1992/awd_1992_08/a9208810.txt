Abstract    :
              This award is for support of a lake coring program in the Eastern              
              Canadian Arctic with the goal of recovering continuous records of              
              environmental change for the last 10 to 15 ka.  Pollen and diatom              
              assemblages will be studied, as well as the physical                           
              characteristics of the cores.  Down-core variations in the stable              
              isotopic ratios of carbon and hydrogen in plant macrofossils and               
              the dissolved organic carbon content of the sediments will be                  
              studied.  These studies will address questions of climate change,              
              including regional glacial history and sea-level change.
