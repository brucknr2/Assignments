Abstract    :
              This grant from the Organic Dynamics Program supports the                      
              continuing work of Professor Maurice M. Kreevoy at the                         
              University of Minnesota.  An experimental and theoretical study                
              of hydride donation to NAD+ and abstraction from NADH will be                  
              studied.  A semi-empirical potential energy surface for the                    
              transfer of the hydrogen isotope will be fit to the                            
              experimental data and the ability of this surface to predict                   
              the reactivity in deuteride transfer will be examined.  The                    
              computations will use the POLYRATE program to predict the                      
              effect of ion pairing and the explicit inclusion of solvent on                 
              rate constants and isotope effects.

              An important pathway for the transfer of electrons to and from                 
              organic molecules involves the transfer of a hydride ion,                      
              whichis a hydrogen atom with an additional electron. In effect,                
              this type of electron transfer involves the simultaneous                       
              transfer of an electron and a hydrogen atom.  New methodology                  
              will be developed for the study of hydride abstraction from and                
              addition to biologically iomportant molecules.  This work will                 
              fundametally strengthen our knowledge of reactions of                          
              polyatomic substances in solution, and particulary the role of                 
              the solvent in such reactions.
