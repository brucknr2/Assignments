Abstract    :
              Research to extend the control of surface processes during                     
              molecular beam epitaxy will be conducted.  The approach is to use              
              ion scattering from the growth surface, allowing both ion                      
              scattering spectroscopy (ISS), at low ion fluxes, and controlled               
              growth mode modification at higher fluxes.  ISS provides                       
              composition analysis of the first atomic layer of the surface                  
              providing alloy composition control and control of layer                       
              thicknesses in the monolayer range.  Glancing angle ions, obtained             
              using the ISS ion source, provide a unique method for tailoring                
              surfaces since shadowing effects can be used to focus ion energy at            
              specific surface sites.  For example, impingement angles where                 
              energy is deposited at surface defects, but not at perfect regions,            
              can be used to enhance adatom mobilities, flatten surfaces, or                 
              improve the ordering of surface steps.

              While molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) has led to tremendous advances              
              in solid state physics and semiconductor devices, it is not optimum            
              for device production.  This research seeks to better understand               
              fundamental processes occuring during MBE at the atomic level, and             
              to overcome one of the major hurdles to the use of MBE on a larger             
              scale.
