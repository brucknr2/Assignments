Abstract    :
              This project will investigate the algorithmic aspects of                       
              matrix scaling problems.  These problems call for pre and post                 
              multiplication of a given matrix by two diagonal matrices so                   
              that the resulting scaled matrix satisfies prescribed                          
              conditions.  A wide variety of practical and theoretical                       
              problems fall within the general framework of matrix scaling                   
              problems.  These include: (i) scaling of nonnegative matrices                  
              to prescribed row-column sums, (ii) similarity scaling,                        
              balancing, and matrix preconditioning, (iii) scaling of                        
              nonnegative matrices to prescribed row-column maxima-minima,                   
              (iv) scaling of positive semidefinite matrices, and some                       
              others.  Cases (i) and (ii) of the scaling problem and their                   
              applications have been studied for a long time, case (iii) of                  
              the problem includes the problem of determining the ergodic                    
              values of matrix games, and case (iv) turn out to be a natrual                 
              generalization of linear programming.  The emphasis of this                    
              research is the study of the computational complexity of                       
              various types of scaling problems, as well as the development                  
              of effective algorithms and approximation schemes, and to test                 
              the algorithms computationally.
