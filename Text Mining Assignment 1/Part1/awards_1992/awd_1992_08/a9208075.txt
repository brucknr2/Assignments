Abstract    :
                   This project makes use of recent ideas in theoretical physics,            
              such as gauge theory and topological quantum field theories, to                
              study the topology of low-dimensional manifolds.  Topics to be                 
              considered include (1) Floer homology and 4-manifold invariants,               
              (2) magnetic monopoles and polynomial invariants for 3-manifolds,              
              (3) topology and symmetric hyperbolic equations, (4) the geometry              
              of magnetic monopoles.                                                         
                   There is a long tradition of mathematicians involving                     
              themselves in the problems of physics, often to the mutual                     
              enrichment of both subjects.  Tools are developed to solve physical            
              problems and then turn out to have much greater generality and                 
              become widely used in mathematics.  The story of the new quantum               
              invariants of 4-manifolds which figure in this project fits this               
              pattern.  Mathematicians interesting themselves in problems of                 
              quantum field theory were led to a certain geometric construction.             
              The construction led in turn to an invariant that depended only on             
              the topological character and not the full geometric character of              
              the underlying manifold.  There are now variations on the original             
              construction and numerous resulting quantum invariants.  Their                 
              origin is sufficiently different from that of other previously                 
              known invariants that they can be expected to detect things the                
              traditional invariants cannot, but it behooves topologists to                  
              demonstrate this explicitly, as well as to sort out the different              
              quantum invariants and their relationships to more traditional                 
              invariants.
