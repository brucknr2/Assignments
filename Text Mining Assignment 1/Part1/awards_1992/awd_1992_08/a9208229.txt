Abstract    :
                   In tropical forests, most colonization of small disturbed                 
              areas (e.g., treefall gaps) is from dormant seeds deposited by                 
              animals in intact forest some time before the disturbance                      
              occurs.  Such seeds become incorporated into the soil, and                     
              germinate in response to a later disturbance.  These "soil seed                
              banks" have profound consequences for such "pioneer" plants and                
              the communities in which they occur.  Species composition in                   
              regenerating patches is largely determined by the composition of               
              the seed bank at the time of disturbance, for example.                         
              Nevertheless, virtually nothing is known about the dynamics of                 
              seed banks, especially rates of seed removal by predators and                  
              pathogens, physiologically-imposed limits to longevity, etc..                  
              This study will make use of carefully replicated experiments to                
              measure rates of seed arrival, transition from litter to soil,                 
              and removal in order to understand the dynamics of soil seed                   
              banks in detail.  I will then examine the consequences of seed                 
              demography for community structure in regenerating forest                      
              patches, as well as for the evolution of ripening phenologies and              
              plant-disperser relationships.  The data gathered in this project              
              is basic to understanding  natural forest regeneration , and to                
              efforts to preserve or restore species-rich tropical forests.
