Abstract    :
                   The aim of this research is to contribute both the theory                 
              and applications of multivariate splines.  The theoretical                     
              questions to be addressed involve dimensions of multivariate                   
              spline spaces, construction of local bases for these spaces, and               
              study of their approximation power.  In addition to the                        
              traditional spaces defined on triangulations, new spaces defined               
              on triangulations of the sphere or other 3D objects will also be               
              investigated.                                                                  
                   The applications involve the use of simulated annealing to                
              construct optimal triangulations, the design of shape preserving               
              interpolation and data fitting methods, the use of radial basis                
              functions for penalized least squares fitting, and adaptive                    
              methods for fitting functions of many variables.
