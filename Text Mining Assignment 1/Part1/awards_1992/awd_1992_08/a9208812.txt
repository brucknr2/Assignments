Abstract    :
              This is a proposal to purchase an optical microscope and a                     
              cryostat for histological sectioning for use at the Whitney                    
              Marine Laboratory of the University of Florida.  This                          
              equipment is particularly intended for immunocytochemical                      
              studies of development,                                                        
              secretion and signaling in marine animals.  These studies                      
              employ of a variety of modern cell and molecular biological                    
              techniques, but since any findings must, ultimately, be                        
              evaluated with respect to the cellular or intracellular                        
              localization of the processes in question, the use of                          
              techniques for localizing specific molecules has become                        
              increasingly important.  This group of investigators                           
              requests funds to acquire (1) a new cryostat to replace a                      
              very heavily used but aging unit whose operation is very                       
              inefficient and time consuming and (2) a research grade                        
              compound microscope which hitherto has not been available at                   
              the laboratory.  These units will be housed in a central                       
              histology/microscopy facility that is currently being built.
