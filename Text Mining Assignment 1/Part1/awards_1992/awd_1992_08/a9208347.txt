Abstract    :
              This award from the Office of Special Projects of the Division                 
              of Chemistry will enable the participation of twelve young U.S.                
              chemists in the Bilateral NSF-Science and Engineering Research                 
              Council (SERC) Workshop on Organometallics in Organic Synthesis                
              being held at Loch Lomond, Scotland, on August 2-7, 1992.  This                
              workshop, convened at recommendation of the NSF Chemistry                      
              Advisory Committee, brings together some twenty-five young                     
              American and British scientists who are likely to become                       
              leaders in the field.                                                          
              %%%                                                                            
              The formation of carbon-carbon bonds in a predictable manner is                
              of utmost importance to organic synthesis.  In this context,                   
              reactions which proceed through the intermediacy of                            
              organometallic complexes have become increasingly important.                   
              Organometallic chemistry bridges the traditional disciplines of                
              organic and inorganic chemistry by allowing metals to act as                   
              templates for organic reactions. The primary aim of this                       
              Bilateral NSF-SERC Workshop on Organometallics in Organic                      
              Synthesis is to expose young scientists to the wider community                 
              of international scholarship and to build the foundation for                   
              long term international collaborations.
