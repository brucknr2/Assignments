Abstract    :
              Ciesielski         Wave-pipelining is a method of high-performance circuit 
              design which implements pipelining in logic without the use of  intermediate
              latches.  As a result, several computation waves  (signals) related to
              different clock cycles can propagate through  the logic simultaneously.  This
              research extends previous  implementations of wave-pipelining in static logic
              to include  dynamic CMOS logic which is known for its smaller area and 
              higher-performance.  Previous work in wave-pipelining uses the  insertion of
              delay elements on signal and clock lines to equalize  path delays.  These
              delays are often imprecise and can require a  significant amount of VLSI area. 
              To avoid these problems, we  equalize the paths by restructuring the
              computation within the  logic block.  The restructuring at the logic level,
              using tools  of modern logic synthesis, is targeted towards highly structured 
              computations and regular arrays.  The new methods are implemented  in a suite
              of CAD tools to make wave pipelining accessible in  automatic VLSI synthesis
              systems.  Several VLSI test chips are  being designed, fabricated and tested to
              verify the feasibility  of our methods and CAD tools.
