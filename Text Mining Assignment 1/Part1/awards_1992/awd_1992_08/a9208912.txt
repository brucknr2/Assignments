Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The purpose of this project is to map genes for female preference              
              within the t-complex.  The t-complex is found on Chromosome 17 of              
              the house mouse (Mus species).  The genetic variant known as "t                
              haplotype" within this region is characterized by:1) the                       
              possession of recessive lethal factors producing death of                      
              homozygous (t/t) mice during embryonic development 2) genes that               
              distort the transmission of sperm such that 70-90% of the progeny              
              of a +/t male inherit his t-haplotype .  Additionally, previous                
              work in my laboratory has indicated that t-haplotypes also carry               
              genes that result in +/t females having strong preferences for                 
              +/+ as opposed to +/t males.  The experiments in the proposed                  
              project are designed to 1: Systematically test females carrying                
              different t-haplotypes for preference to determine whether                     
              differences exist among t-haplotypes in the gene(s) for                        
              preference 2: test females carrying partial haplotypes                         
              (haplotypes that carry part, but not all of the genes normally                 
              associated with a complete t-haplotype) for preference to map                  
              where, within the large (15cm) t-complex the gene(s) for female                
              preference are located 3: Test wild-caught females carrying                    
              partial haplotypes for preference to determine whether partial                 
              haplotypes in wild females have been produced by recombination                 
              from complete haplotypes or instead, represent ancestral building              
              blocks from which t-haplotypes have been later assembled.
