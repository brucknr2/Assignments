Abstract    :
              Dispersal is a major life history characteristic composed of many              
              interacting traits.  Most arguments about the evolution of                     
              dispersal patterns assume that there is significant genetic                    
              variation for these traits and genetically covary with other traits            
              that are influenced by natural selection.  A major difficulty in               
              understanding the evolution of dispersal patterns has been the                 
              inability to quantify individual differences in those biological               
              parameters contributing to dispersal potential.  In the marine                 
              slipper snail, Crepidula fornicata, the principal biological trait             
              governing dispersal capacity is the duration of a free-swimming                
              larval stage.  Larval of Crepidula must develop in the plankton for            
              one to several weeks before becoming capable of metamorphosing to              
              the sedentary  juvenile stage.  This period of obligatory dispersal            
              can now be quantified for individual larvae.  We propose to                    
              determine the quantitative genetic covariance with other larval and            
              post-metamorphic traits that have been previously proposed to                  
              influence the development of metamorphic competence and fitness                
              variation.  We will specifically test the hypothesis that dispersal            
              capacity may evolve through its genetic correlation with other                 
              traits that are subject to natural selection.
