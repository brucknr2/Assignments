Abstract    :
                   This grant supports the research of Professor F. Garvan to                
              work on problems in additive number theory.  In particular he                  
              will concentrate on various conjectures arising from the                       
              connection between Dedekind's eta function and partition theory.               
              He also hopes to continue working on the Macdonald root system                 
              conjectures.                                                                   
                   This is research in the field of number theory.  Number                   
              theory starts with the whole numbers and questions such as the                 
              divisibility of one whole number by another.  It is among the                  
              oldest fields of mathematics and it was originally pursued for                 
              purely aesthetic reasons.  However, within the last half century,              
              it has become an essential tool in developing new algorithms for               
              computer science and new error correcting codes for electronics.
