Abstract    :
                   The principal investigator will continue his research on                  
              singularities of the n-body problem, especially the non-collision              
              singularities and the relation between collision singularities                 
              and non-collision singularities. He will also work on some                     
              special solutions of the n-body problem which arise from an                    
              analysis of the final evolution of the gravitational system.                   
                   This award will support research in the general area of                   
              dynamical systems. A process which is very simple and easy to                  
              understand locally can become extremely complicated, nonlinear,                
              and difficult to analyze globally. Dynamical systems is the study              
              of this local to global relationship. Many physical systems can                
              best be modeled using this area of mathematics including fluid                 
              flow and turbulence, complex biological systems, mechanical                    
              systems, and chemical reactions.
