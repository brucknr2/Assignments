Abstract    :
              This award in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic                  
              Program provides continued support for research by Dr. Joseph                  
              L. Templeton of the Chemistry Department, University of North                  
              Carolina, on the reactions of coordinated 4-electron donor                     
              ligands.  Templeton will synthesize chiral metal alkyne                        
              complexes of niobium (III) and tungsten (II) containing new                    
              alkyne, alcohol and eneyne ligands.  Enantioselective reactions                
              with resolved metal complexes will be used to build                            
              intermediate size rings, to promote 1,4-conjugate addition                     
              across the olefin tail of coordinated eneynes, and to cleave                   
              the alkyne to generate organic products.  Diastereoselective                   
              nucleophilic additions will be promoted by aldehyde and ketone                 
              complexes.   Platinum (IV) alkyne complexes will be studied,                   
              and nitrogen activation will also be explored using analogous                  
              reactions with isoelectronic dinitrogen.                                       
              %%%                                                                            
              Organic molecules will be tranformed while they are attached to                
              a metal.  The reactions are of a special type in which the                     
              "handedness" or chirality of the product is controlled.                        
              Development of powerful and versatile reagents which can be                    
              selective in this way is the important goal of this research.                  
              The results have implications for many industrial processes                    
              which are catalyzed by transition metals and for the synthesis                 
              of pure organic compounds for use in drug manufacture.
