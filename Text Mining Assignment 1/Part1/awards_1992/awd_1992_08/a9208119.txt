Abstract    :
                   Research in electromagnetic nuclear physics will be                       
              carried out at a number of electron accelerator facilities.                    
              Most of the near term experimental effort will make use of the                 
              electron accelerator facilities at the University of                           
              Saskatchewan, MIT/Bates, Mainz, and Brookhaven National Lab                    
              (the LEGS facility).  Longer term CEBAF projects are under                     
              development.  Experiments will focus on the structure of                       
              excited baryon resonances, few-nucleon systems, and the                        
              dynamics of photopion production from light nuclei, making use                 
              of both real and virtual photons, polarized and unpolarized.                   
              Particular emphasis is placed on development of Cherenkov                      
              detectors for the CEBAF large acceptance spectrometer, which                   
              will be used in the studies of baryon resonances.
