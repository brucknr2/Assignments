Abstract    :
                   Klein will study phenomena that occur in disordered systems.              
              The topics included are quantum spin systems in a random                       
              environment, contact and percolation processes in a random                     
              environment, random Schroedinger operators, and critical                       
              exponents for classical rotors.  Shlosman will investigate                     
              properties of low temperature random fields in statistical                     
              mechanics.  The multiphase structure of these fields is reflected              
              in the unusual properties of their large deviations                            
              probabilities, due to the phenomenon of formation of crystals of               
              different phases in typical large deviation configurations.                    
                   Modern physics, quantum mechanics and relativity, is a                    
              product of the twentieth century.  It is founded firmly in the                 
              last century's attempt to address the microstructure of matter                 
              and to come to grips with the concepts of action-at-a distance,                
              electro-magnetism, and heat radiation.  The mathematical                       
              foundations for these developments, collectively called                        
              mathematical physics, ranges from detailed analysis of                         
              Schroedinger operators, which governs the dynamics of particles,               
              to unified field theory, which attempts to unite the four known                
              forces into a single theory.
