Abstract    :
                   For his post-doctoral studies, this Fellow will isolate,                  
              fractionate, and characterize analytical quantities of dissolved               
              organic carbon (DOC) in seawater in order to find possible                     
              representative molecules.  By measuring DOC at every step, a                   
              quantitative mass balance will be achieved.  This is critical for              
              determining the significance of each DOC fraction on a global                  
              scale.  The major fractions will be investigated in terms of                   
              depth and spatial variations.  Studies should reveal the relative              
              sources of DOC in the oceans; terrestrial, marine, sedimentary,                
              and planktonic sources all have characteristic signals.                        
              Ultimately these data can be incorporated into a global                        
              circulation model, modelling not currently possible as DOC is                  
              treated as one species with one geochemical cycle.  His studies                
              at Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute (WHOI) provide an ideal                  
              match for the personnel and facilities there.  The blend of                    
              expertise in organic chemistry identification techniques and this              
              Fellow's studies of DOC will be an unique approach to                          
              understanding global DOC cycling.//
