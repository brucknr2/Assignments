Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The primary objective of this project is to study the growth and               
              development of the temporal bone in humans and non-human                       
              primates.  This will provide the background for interpreting the               
              data from the hominid fossil record thereby allowing for further               
              understanding of the evolutionary history of humans.                           
                                                                                             
              The temporal bone, the bone of the skull housing the ear, is                   
              important to anthropologists for two reasons:                                  
                  1)  It is a highly complex structure and thus has a high                   
              information density.  Aside from containing the organs for                     
              hearing and balance, the temporal bone serves as the portion of                
              the skull that articulates with the mandible and thus plays a                  
              major role in chewing and diet.  This complexity leads to a high               
              degree of variability among species.  Therefore the temporal bone              
              is crucial to our understanding of the relationships of fossil                 
              specimens.                                                                     
                   2)  The petrous portion of the temporal bone is one of the                
              densest areas of the body. This part of the skeleton is thus one               
              of the likliest to fossilize and thereby be represented in the                 
              fossil record.                                                                 
                                                                                             
              The examination of development of this bone and its concomitant                
              structures will provide an additional dimension of information to              
              the hominid fossil record beyond that provided by examination of               
              the adult forms.
