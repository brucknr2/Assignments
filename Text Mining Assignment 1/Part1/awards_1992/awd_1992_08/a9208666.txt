Abstract    :
                   Professor Korevaar will continue to apply previously                      
              developed analytic and topological techniques to the geometric                 
              structure of constant mean curvature surfaces.  Further                        
              applications will be made to the study of constant scalar                      
              curvature metrics with conformality. resolving these                           
              problems is expected to lead to a number of interesting                        
              breakthroughs in classical surface theory where previously                     
              applied methods were not always successful. Another problem                    
               is to continue the manifold decomposition methods developed                   
               via spectral theory of the Laplace operator to investigate                    
               `shape' phenomena.  The PI is also committed to training several              
              graduate students in this area of research.
