Abstract    :
              This grant from the Organic Dynamics Program supports the work                 
              of Professor Charles F. Wilcox and Simon H. Bauer at Cornell                   
              University.  The ability of the "temperature drift technique"                  
              to measure the concentrations and energetics of transition                     
              structures will be explored.  Quantum and molecular mechanics                  
              calculations will provide the information needed to identify                   
              the vibrational bands produced by the transient species formed                 
              in the reaction.  Fluxional interconversions involving                         
              degenerate sigmatropic rearrangements, for which a range of                    
              activation energies have been determined, will be examined.                    
              %%%                                                                            
              Studies designed to directly observed molecules which are high                 
              in energy and structurally intermediate between starting                       
              materials and products will be conducted.  Molecules which                     
              react thermally to form products will be subjected to very                     
              short duration high temperature pulses.  The ability of the                    
              resultant activated material to absorb radiation as it drifts                  
              down in temperature will be monitored.  This new previously                    
              unavailable data will greatly increase our ability to                          
              understand how molecules interconvert.
