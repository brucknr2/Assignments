Abstract    :
              A two-component Laser Doppler Velocimeter (LDV) is acquired                    
              for a combined experimental and numerical study to enhance the                 
              basic understanding of the physics of two-way coupling between                 
              small spherical particles and turbulence.  The two-way                         
              nonlinear coupling between particles and turbulence                            
              encompasses the dispersion of  discrete particles due to the                   
              turbulent motion of the fluid, and the modulation of the                       
              turbulence structure by the motion on the particles.  The                      
              primary goal of the experimental study is to simultaneously                    
              measure the instantaneous velocities of the fluid and                          
              particles in two directions and at two positions using a                       
              specially designed two-component LDV.                                          
                                                                                             
              The results obtained from direct numerical simulation will be                  
              compared with the experimental data, and used to test and                      
              improve available turbulence closure models of particle-laden                  
              flows.
