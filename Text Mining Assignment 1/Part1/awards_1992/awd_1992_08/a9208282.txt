Abstract    :
                   This awards supports the research of Professors R. Smith and              
              R. Varley to work in algebraic geometry.  They will work on                    
              computing deformations of maps and singularities and applying it               
              to problems in the theory of Hodge structures of varieties and                 
              their moduli.                                                                  
                   The research is in the field of algebraic geometry, one of                
              the oldest parts of modern mathematics, but one which blossomed                
              to the point where it has, in the past 10 years, solved problems               
              that have stood for centuries.  Originally, it treated figures                 
              defined in the plane by the simplest of equations, namely                      
              polynomials.  Today, the field uses methods not only from                      
              algebra, but also from analysis and topology, and conversely it                
              is extensively used in those fields.   Moreover, it has proved                 
              itself useful in fields as diverse as physics, theoretical                     
              computer science, cryptography, coding theory and robotics.
