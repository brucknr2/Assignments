Abstract    :
              This project focuses on the effects of legal counsel from the                  
              perspective of "party capability theory," a set of ideas which                 
              proposes that powerful and organized parties who use courts                    
              routinely hold tactical and strategic advantage over weaker                    
              parties, especially individual litigants who use judicial resources            
              only intermittently.                                                           
                                                                                             
              Specifically, it investigates whether and how disparities between              
              counsel related resources affect the ruling made by an appellate               
              court.  In addition, the research employs a multivariate                       
              statistical model to assess the importance of counsel related                  
              resources in relation to other explanations for outcomes in                    
              appellate courts.  In addition to advancing empirical understanding            
              of whether and how lawyers make a difference in litigation, the                
              cross-national framework, focusing on the English Court of Appeals,            
              enables exploration of the extent to which party capability theory             
              is context-bound to the U.S. experience.
