Abstract    :
                   One of the most exciting frontiers in general relativity                  
              is the direct detection of gravitational radiation from                        
              astrophysical sources.  A number of detector systems are                       
              currently in various stages of planning and development both                   
              here and abroad.  Notable among these is the LIGO detector,                    
              recently funded by Congress, which is expected to be                           
              operational before the end of this decade.  On the theoretical                 
              side, much activity is focused on calculating the                              
              gravitational waveforms expected from various sources.                         
              Understanding many of the most interesting sources is believed                 
              to require large scale numerical simulations.                                  
                   This research will develop two 3-D hydrodynamical codes                   
              and apply them to calculate the gravitational waveforms                        
              emitted from several astrophysical sources.  The Eulerian code                 
              will study stellar collapse and rotational instabilities,                      
              while the fully Lagrangian code will model the collision and                   
              coalescence of neutron stars.  Both codes will use Newtonian                   
              and post-Newtonian gravity including gravitational radiation                   
              reaction.  The development of two independent codes will allow                 
              cross-checking and intercomparison of results; this is                         
              important to verify that the codes produce the correct                         
              physical behavior.  The resulting waveforms are expected to be                 
              of considerable interest with regard to the experimental                       
              efforts to detect gravitational waves.
