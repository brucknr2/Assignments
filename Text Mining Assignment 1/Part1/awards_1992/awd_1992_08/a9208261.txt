Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This project continues the planning and implementation of the U.S.             
              Joint Global Ocean Flux Program (U.S. JGOFS).  The principal theme             
              is to identify and quantify the physical, chemical and biological              
              processes controlling biogeochemical cycling in the ocean, and                 
              their interaction with the global atmosphere.  The goal is to                  
              understand the processes governing the production and fate of                  
              biogenic materials in the sea well enough to predict their                     
              influences on, and responses to, global scale perturbations.  In               
              order to achieve these complex goals, the Planning and Coordination            
              Office serves the needs of coordination, implementation,                       
              communication, publication, planning and representation of the                 
              scientific issues involved, both nationally and internationally.               
              A major process study in the Equatorial Pacific is underway, as                
              well as planning for subsequent studies.  Measurements at the                  
              Bermuda and Hawaii Time-Series stations continue during the next               
              three years, and a JGOFS global survey of CO2, pigments and optics             
              measurements is a continuing element on the WOCE Hydrographic                  
              Program cruises.
