Abstract    :
                   In recent years there has been a resurgence of interest in                
              phylogenetic reconstruction.  Molecular techniques have provided               
              a wealth of new and promising approaches for understanding                     
              phylogenies, and the application of phylogenies, and the                       
              application of phylogenetic analysis to a diversity of                         
              interesting biological questions is becoming common.  The purpose              
              of this symposium is to assess the utility of phylogentic                      
              analysis for studies of the natural history of plant breeding                  
              systems.  Topics included in the symposium include the radiation               
              of pollination systems, mechanisms in conifers that compensate                 
              for strong inbreeding depression, the origin of self-                          
              incompatibility and floral trimorphism in a tristylous family,                 
              the origin of outcrossing from selfing in a hermaphroditic, self-              
              compatible species, the origin of androdioecy from dioecy, and                 
              the origin of dioecy from hermaphroditism.
