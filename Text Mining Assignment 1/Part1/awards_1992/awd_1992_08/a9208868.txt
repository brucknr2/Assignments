Abstract    :
              The aim of this workshop is to                                                 
              discuss the geotechnical research                                              
              needs for the assessment and                                                   
              mitigation of damage to the                                                    
              infrastructure resulting from                                                  
              strong ground shaking.

              structures, water retaining                                                    
              structures such as earth dams,                                                 
              underground structures, and in                                                 
              general, any structure built on or                                             
              of soils.  Losses in the                                                       
              infrastructure due to earthquake                                               
              damage has been a significant                                                  
              fraction of the initial                                                        
              construction costs.                                                            
                                                                                             
              Assessment and mitigation of damage                                            
              to the infrastructure involves                                                 
              identifying the potential damage to                                            
              the infrastructure caused by large

              construction methods.  A particular                                            
              focus is on verification of these
