Abstract    :
                   The principal investigator will work on several projects.                 
              The first focusses on extremal problems involving (generalized)                
              moment inequalities for sums of independent, symmetric random                  
              variables with an eye toward obtaining best constants.  The                    
              research builds on the classic inequalities of Khintchine and                  
              Rosenthal.  The from of the final inequalities should give some                
              insight into the nature of cancellation phenomena and may suggest              
              extensions to more general dependence relations.  This work is                 
              ongoing and is joint work with T. Figiel, P. Hitczenko and W. B.               
              Johnson.  The second project concerns structural problems for U-               
              statistics and U-processes.  Gine and the principal investigator               
              have found very little information concerning necessity in the                 
              context of U-statistics.  Together with J. Cuzik, they have made               
              some progress on a very special case, but there is much more work              
              required to understand the general question of cancellation in                 
              this context.  Two other projects deal with trying to find usable              
              necessary and sufficient conditions for a class of functions to                
              be uniform Donsker (with E. Gine) and studying questions                       
              concerning convergence rates in the context of bootstrapping                   
              empirical measures (with F. Gotze).                                            
                   The principal investigator is working on several projects                 
              whose primary focus is a better understanding of cancellation                  
              phenomena for sums of independent random variables.  These types               
              of problems often arise in statistics.
