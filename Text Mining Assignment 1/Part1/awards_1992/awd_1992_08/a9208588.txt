Abstract    :
                   The Pacific to Arizona Crustal Experiment (PACE) is a                     
              multidisciplinary transect which crosses an old magmatic arc, a                
              continental rift, a transform plate boundary, and an extensional               
              terrane located in southern California.  This award supports a                 
              magnetotelluric survey along this transect.  MT soundings, to date,            
              have revealed a strong correlation with detachment fault geometry              
              east of the Salton Trough in the Chocolate Mountains extensional               
              terrane.  Also, a regional detachment surface postulated by                    
              seismologists has probably been detected beneath the Peninsular                
              Ranges.
