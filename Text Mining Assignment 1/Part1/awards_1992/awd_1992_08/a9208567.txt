Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              A high level of process automation is a key to the safe,                       
              efficient, and competitive manufacture of high quality                         
              materials.  A common focus of control research is the                          
              development of new technologies to build highly autonomous                     
              chemical processes; autonomous in the sense that they can                      
              function with a reduced level of operator intervention.                        
                                                                                             
              The main issues to be dealt with in this research project are                  
              the integration of control and fault diagnosis to realize                      
              fault tolerant control systems, making effective use of                        
              process information, and developing a coherent theoretical                     
              approach to discrete process operations.  The work will                        
              consist of three specific studies on new, fundamental                          
              approaches to process monitoring: (1) the integration of                       
              multivariable control and fault detection in L1/l  using a                     
              four parameter controller; (2) a study of the application of                   
              multiresolution techniques for signal processing (wavelets) to                 
              process monitoring and control; and (3) the development of a                   
              novel hybrid continuous/discrete-event model for process fault                 
              detection and diagnosis.  The study goals include the                          
              development of new theoretical approaches to these problems.                   
              Significant effort will be devoted to the development of                       
              effective computational procedures.  Cooperation with active                   
              industrial research groups will foster the transfer of the                     
              technology to industrial practice.
