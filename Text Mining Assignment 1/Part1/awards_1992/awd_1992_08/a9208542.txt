Abstract    :
              This proposal continues a long term study of the structure and                 
              specificity of antibodies to a homopolymer of glucose alpha(1-6)               
              dextran and its oligosaccharides, and on blood group A, B and                  
              H substances.  It characterizes their primary and higher order                 
              structures by a variety of techniques.  The cavity-and groove-type             
              sites were defined, the former specific for terminal non-reducing              
              alpha(1-6) linked glucoses plus 3 or 4 additional residues, and the            
              latter reacting with internal chains of up to six or seven glucoses            
              not including the non-reducing end.  Anti-idiotypic sera and                   
              monoclonal antibodies recognizing either groove-or cavity-type                 
              sites have been obtained.  Model-building studies show that two                
              cavity-type sites vary in size.  The hybridoma repertoire of                   
              anti-alpha(1-6) dextrans is being compared with E. coli expressed              
              Fab repertoire.  The role of Vl-CDR3 and J(kappa) on antigen                   
              binding, idiotype expression and combining sites structure of the              
              groove-type anti-alpha(1-6) dextrans with V(kappa)-Oxl light chain             
              is being studied by the generation of recombinant Fab and computer             
              modelling.                                                                     
              %%%                                                                            
              The research will concentrate on the following aspects of                      
              monoclonal antibodies to .(1-->6) dextrans: a) Mapping the                     
              structures of the combining sites by immunochemical methods and                
              studies of anti-.(1-->6) dextrans with cavity and groove type                  
              antibody combining sites and their idiotypic specificities;  b)                
              Providing quantities of the various characterized anti-.(1-->6)                
              dextrans to various crystallographic laboratories for                          
              crystallization and high resolution x-ray diffraction studies.  c)             
              Continuation of replacement studies of a cloned antibody (amino                
              acid residues 31 to 35) by glycines that have shown an                         
              extraordinary effect in greatly reducing anti .(1-->6) dextran                 
              reactivity and substantial restoration of 80% of the original anti             
              .(1-->6) dextran specificity by replacing glycine 32 and 33 by                 
              tyrosine and tryptophan. d) Studying the effects of similar                    
              substitutions in other interaction domains of the antibody.
