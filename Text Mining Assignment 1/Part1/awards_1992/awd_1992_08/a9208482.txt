Abstract    :
                   The proposers will study several problems concerning the                  
              structure of Banach spaces.  Rosenthal and Odell will focus                    
              mainly on infinite-dimensional issues, while Mascioni will study               
              quantitative invariants for finite-dimensional spaces.  Rosenthal              
              and Odell will work on the subspace structure of general non-                  
              reflexive spaces and of quotients of certain spaces with                       
              separable duals.  Mascioni will study invariants connected with                
              the uniform approximation property.  He will investigate the                   
              order of growth of the uniformity function of Lp-spaces, and the               
              duality-order of growth of general spaces with the uap.                        
                   Banach space theory is that part of mathematics that                      
              attempts to generalize to infinitely many dimensions the                       
              structure of 3-dimensional Euclidean (i.e.ordinary) space.  The                
              axioms for the distance function in a Banach space are more                    
              relaxed than those for Euclidean distance (For example, the                    
              "parallelogram law" is not required to hold.), and as a result,                
              the "geometry" of a Banach space can be quite exotic.  Much of                 
              the research in this area concerns studying the structure theory               
              of Banach spaces.
