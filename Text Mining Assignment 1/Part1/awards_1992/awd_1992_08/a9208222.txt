Abstract    :
              The focus of this research is the use of aniodic coupling of                   
              electron rich alkenes to provide a method for triggering                       
              oxidative cyclization reactions.  New terminating groups for                   
              cyclization reactions will be developed, temporary silicon                     
              tethers will be employed to control the relative and absolute                  
              stereochemistry of quaternary carbon synthesis, sequential                     
              chemical reaction-electrochemical cyclization strategies will                  
              be used to construct complex ring systems and the aniodic                      
              initiation of tandem cyclization reactions will be explored.

              With this renewal award, the Synthetic Organic Program is                      
              supporting the research of Dr. Kevin D. Moeller of the                         
              Department of Chemistry at Washington University.  Dr. Moeller                 
              will focus his work on demonstrating the versatility of organic                
              electrochemistry as a tool for organic synthesis.
