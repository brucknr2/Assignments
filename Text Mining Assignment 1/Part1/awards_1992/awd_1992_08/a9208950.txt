Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This research will extend dynamic theories of games in several                 
              directions.  Part 1 contributes to the growing literature on                   
              evolution and learning.  It will examine how a stable pattern of               
              behavior might emerge when players adjust their behavior by trial              
              and error.  In particular, the study will focus on the long run                
              implications of experimentation or mutations in such a process.                
              This approach has the potential to make a unique prediction, even              
              when the underlying game possesses multiple locally stable                     
              equilibria.                                                                    
                                                                                             
              Part 2 examines the nature of implicit collusion in a realistic                
              situation, where information about the past history is not common              
              knowledge.  The investigator will formulate a model of a discounted            
              repeated game with privately observable outcomes, and will explore             
              the role of communication.  This study is important because it will            
              improve our understanding in situations, prevalent in industrial               
              organization literature and organizational settings, in which                  
              players receive private signals about past play and implicit                   
              agreements are developed.
