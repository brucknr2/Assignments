Abstract    :
              The objective of this research is to produce efficient and                     
              effective FPGA partitioning and placement tools that are capable               
              of simultaneously meeting a number of objectives subject to several            
              design requirements in order to achieve optimal system performance.            
              Dr. Saab has developed two algorithmic methodologies for the                   
              solution of large-scale combinatorial problems with several                    
              constraints.  These two general techniques are:  Stochastic                    
              Evolution which is a probabilistic algorithm, and the Limited                  
              Exhaustive Search Strategy which is a strict descent iterative                 
              algorithm.  Initial experimentation with these two techniques is               
              quite encouraging and optimal solutions are achieved in certain                
              applications.  The goal is to use these two general optimization               
              techniques to obtain effective and efficient FPGA partitioning and             
              placement tools.  This research will also investigate other                    
              approaches for partitioning and placement such as genetic                      
              algorithms, neural nets, and tabu search, and can potentially                  
              stimulate the use of Stochastic Evolution and the Limited                      
              Exhaustive Search Strategy for the solutions of many large and                 
              difficult engineering problems.  FPGA design tools are immediate               
              consequences of this effort.
