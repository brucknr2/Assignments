Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Eleven U.S. researchers will participate in a two-day U.S.-Russia              
              seminar on Cryopedology and Global Change following the                        
              International Conference on Cryopedology in Pushchino, Russia,                 
              10-14 November, 1992.  The seminar is being organized by Dr.                   
              Chien-Lu Ping of the University of Alaska and Dr. G.V.                         
              Dobrovolsky of the Institute of Soil Science and Photosynthesis of             
              the Russian Academy of Sciences.  The specific objectives of the               
              seminar are to (1) discuss and examine the cryogenic processes in              
              cold soils and identify the fundamental controlling processes of               
              permafrost and alpine soils; (2) design experiments for                        
              cryopedological research to aid the interpretation of global change,           
              paleoecology, and resource management in the arctic and subarctic              
              zones; (3) compare the current classification systems of cryogenic             
              soils in the world, especially in the United States and Russia, and            
              develop a common cross-reference system for soil-based technology              
              transfer among the circumpolar nations; and (4) identify potential             
              research partnerships in permafrost-dominated or cryogenic soils.              
              This activity fulfills the program objective of advancing scientific           
              knowledge by enabling leading researchers in the United States and             
              the former Soviet Union to combine complementary efforts and                   
              capabilities in areas of strong mutual interest and competence in the          
              field of basic scientific research on the basis of equality,                   
              reciprocity, and mutuality of benefit.
