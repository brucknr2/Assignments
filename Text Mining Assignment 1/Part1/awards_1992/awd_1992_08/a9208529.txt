Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The objectives of this research is to synthesize reduced transition            
              metal oxosilicate and oxophosphate compounds that have low-                    
              dimensional structural frameworks.  Compound characterization will             
              be directed toward understanding the bond strength, spin-spin and              
              spin-lattice interactions, band structures, and the onset of                   
              metallic properties associated with quasi-low-dimensional                      
              structures.  The proposed research is significant because it will              
              provide information on a class of structural models for studying               
              the behavior of delocalized electrons in a confined space.  These              
              studies can ultimately be used in the development of new materials             
              that are of magnetic and electronic importance.
