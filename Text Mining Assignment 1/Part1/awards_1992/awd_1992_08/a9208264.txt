Abstract    :
                   The proposed research would use an analysis of mitochondrial              
              DNA and proteins to study relationships among members of                       
              Cyprinodon variegatus complex of pupfishes.  The species of this               
              complex include one wide-ranging species (C. variegatus) that                  
              occurs from Massachusetts to Tampico, Mexico and in the West                   
              Indies from the Bahamas to Jamaica.  The remaining 20 species of               
              the complex occupy much smaller areas, primarily within the range              
              of C. variegatus or near the periphery of its range.  the primary              
              objectives are 1) to understand the major patterns of geographic               
              variation in the wide-ranging species, 2) to relate this                       
              variation to the evolutionary relationships of the geographically              
              more restricted species, and 3) to use the results to evaluate                 
              biogeographic hypotheses and modes of speciation for the complex.              
              Of special interest is the question of whether populations of the              
              wide-ranging species, C. variegatus, might be more closely                     
              related to other species than to populations of their own                      
              species.  If so, then the morphology of the wide-ranging species               
              is primitive for the complex and it comprises one or more cryptic              
              species.  The results will be important in future assessments of               
              faunal origins for regions of particular interest in                           
              biogeography; for example, the West Indies and the western coast               
              of the Gulf of Mexico.
