Abstract    :
              The Fellow will study the tectonic evolution of the northern                   
              East Humboldt Range, Nevada, by integrating the results of                     
              detailed field, structural, thermochronologic, and                             
              thermobarometric studies to constrain the tectonic history of                  
              what are probably the deepest- seated rocks in the Great Basin.                
              Comparisons and contrasts will be made of the macrostructural,                 
              micro-structural, petrological, and crystallographic fabric data               
              with the Saxony granulite terrain in eastern Germany, by using                 
              scanning electron microscopy, electron microprobe, and x-ray                   
              facilities in Zurich, where the Fellow has chosen to spend his                 
              fellowship at the Geologisches Institut of the Eidgenossische                  
              Technische Hochschule (ETH).
