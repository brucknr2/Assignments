Abstract    :
                   This award will support a collaborative effort in the areas               
              of econometrics and statistics.  In particular, the investigators              
              will develop robust techniques for panel data.  Panel data                     
              consist of a time series of observations on each of several                    
              individuals.  Such data are used frequently in economics and                   
              certain biostatistical contexts.  Standard methods for analysis                
              of panel data are not robust to gross measurement errors in the                
              data, and the results of analyses based on these methods can be                
              highly sensitive to gross errors.  This is well known to                       
              investigators who use panel data from sources such as the Current              
              Population Survey.  These investigators routinely use a variety                
              of informal methods to "clean" the data before estimating models               
              and testing hypotheses.  The research proposed will proved formal              
              methods for doing this.                                                        
                   This award will support a collaborative effort in the areas               
              of econometrics and statistics.  In particular, the investigators              
              will develop robust techniques for panel data.  Panel data                     
              consist of a time series of observations on each of several                    
              individuals.  Such data are used frequently in economics and                   
              certain biostatistical contexts.
