Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Theoretical game theory focusses on identifying stable equilibrium             
              solutions to strategic behavior.  However, many empirical strategic            
              contexts exhibit complex, erratic, or evolutionary strategies over             
              time.  For example, in competition when "winning" in addition to               
              merely "Doing well" is important, such as arms races where states              
              are concerned with relative security, a wide range of dynamical                
              strategic behavior is possible.  This project examines iterated                
              strategies in the cases where empirical choices do not result in a             
              stable equilibrium.  The project takes a game-theoretic context and            
              using laboratory experiments, applies the conceptual and                       
              methodological tools of chaotic dynamical systems.  This approach              
              allows for complex and varied strategies resulting from relatively             
              simple interactive relationships.
