Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Long-term evolutionary adaptation to temperature will be measured              
              experimentally in the bacterium Escherichia coli.  Originally the              
              founding experimental line (the ancestor) was maintained at 37 C.              
              Subsequently, groups of replicated lines were obtained after 2000              
              generations of exposure to 32 C, 42 C, and a daily alternation                 
              between them, as well as control lines which were maintained at 37             
              C.  These experiments will determine the mechanisms by which each              
              of these groups adapted to their respective temperatures.  Measured            
              variables will include changes in synthetic and transport                      
              capacities, stress resistance, and population growth performance.              
              Lines will also be selected at higher (>42 C) temperatures to                  
              determine whether the upper thermal limit can be extended and the              
              correlated changes responsible for increased temperature tolerance.            
              The research proposes to address the following questions: --How                
              rapidly can biological systems respond evolutionarily to                       
              environmental change? --Does prior evolutionary history in one                 
              environment condition or predispose ability to adapt to novel                  
              environments? --Does adaptation to a particular environment proceed            
              by similar mechanisms or are there as many solutions as adaptive               
              events?  Specific issues addressed by this research include the                
              rate and limits of adaptation in diverse thermal environments, the             
              extent of trade-offs during adaptive evolution, the effect of                  
              historical environment on further adaptation, the concordance of               
              mechanistic adaptations during evolution in similar environments,              
              and environmental effects on mutational processes.
