Abstract    :
              With National Science Foundation support, the Museum of                        
              Anthropology at the University of Kansas will continue to upgrade              
              its archaeological collections. These prehistoric materials from               
              the Northern and Central Plains of the United States form the                  
              core of its archaeological holdings. The ca. 400,000 specimens                 
              were acquired as a result of over 110 scientific field projects                
              undertaken by members of the Museum staff since 1945. Earlier                  
              projects focussed on the reconstruction of the culture history of              
              the region while more recent efforts have been directed toward                 
              the study of Woodland and Late Archaic cultures with an emphasis               
              on the reconstruction of environment and settlement patterns.                  
                                                                                             
              Photographic records constitute an important source of                         
              archaeological information and provide primary excavation                      
              documentation. The Kansas collection includes ca. 10,000                       
              photographs and these form the core of this conservation project.              
              The photographs will be properly curated to help stabilize the                 
              present rate of deterioration caused by poor storage and                       
              fluctuating humidity levels. Copies will be made of negatives of               
              selected prints; slides used most often for teaching will also be              
              duplicated. A computerized inventory will also be established to               
              serve as a research guide.                                                     
                                                                                             
              This project is important for several reasons. It will help to                 
              preserve basic materials important to the understanding of U.S.                
              prehistory. It will also make this body of data more easily                    
              accessible for scientific research.
