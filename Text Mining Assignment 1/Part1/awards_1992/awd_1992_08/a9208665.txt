Abstract    :
              Coherent optical detection offers the potential to                             
              substantially increase the capabilities of existing                            
              long-haul and local area fiber optic networks.                                 
              However, random drift of the signal polarization                               
              presents the major obstacle to this method of                                  
              detection.  The objective of this program is to                                
              develop a polarization controller that will                                    
              compensate for this polarization drift enabling the                            
              use of coherent detection.  We will research the use                           
              of liquid crystals to accomplish this means.  This                             
              approach will be comparatively much less expensive                             
              and easier to implement than other methods that                                
              are currently under research.
