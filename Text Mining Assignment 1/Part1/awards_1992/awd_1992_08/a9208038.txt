              The 1992 Southeast Regional Developmental Biology Conference will              
              be held at Clemson University on May 22-24, 1992.  The conference              
              will be composed offive sessions: 1) Gametogenesis/                            
              Fertilization/ Early Development; 2) Morphogenesis and Cell                    
              Interactions; 3) Plant Development; 4) Differentiation and                     
              Determination; 5) Gene regulation and Expression; and 6) Cell                  
              Cycle Regulation. The sessions will be composed of approximately               
              equal numbers of talks by accomplished investigators and talks by              
              postdoctoral and graduate students. Two nationally prominent                   
              developmental biologists will give keynote addresses. All                      
              participants will have the opportunity to present posters.
