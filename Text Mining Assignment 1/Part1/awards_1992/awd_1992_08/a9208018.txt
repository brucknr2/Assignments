Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The developmental success of an early embryo depends                           
              fundamentally on the efficacy of oogenesis. Developing oocytes                 
              are geared almost entirely to the segregation and storage of                   
              newly synthesized macromolecules. Dr. Wessel will examine the                  
              ontogeny of two classes of storage organelles in oocytes of the                
              sea urchin - vesicles storing extracellular matrix molecules that              
              are destined for the embryonic blastocoel, and cortical granules               
              that are exocytosed during the fertilization reaction. Both of                 
              these organelles originate early in oogenesis and their contents               
              are each secreted, yet each organelle contains a discreet, non-                
              overlapping population of proteins in distinct membrane bound                  
              vesicles. Dr. Wessel will examine the ontogeny of these                        
              organelles using cDNA and antibody probes that he has made to                  
              specific constituent proteins. The ultimate goal is to understand              
              the mechanism of specific protein "stockpiling" that developing                
              oocytes use to facilitate the commitment of their embryos to a                 
              program of rapid, independent development.
