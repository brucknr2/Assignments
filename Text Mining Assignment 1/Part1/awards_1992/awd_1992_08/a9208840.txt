Abstract    :
              The Fellow will analyze altered Pleistocene corals of the                      
              150,000-year old Key Largo Limestone in order to determine the                 
              implications of meteoric diagenetic changes and their effect on U              
              and Th concentrations and isotopic ratios.  Such relations will                
              be important in estimating Pleistocene sea level fluctuations                  
              based on Th ages of subaerially exposed corals.  The Fellow has                
              chosen to study at the University of Minnesota for the duration                
              of his fellowship.
