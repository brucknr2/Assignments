Abstract    :
              The goal of this proposal is to search for correlations between the            
              superconducting and normal-state properties in selected oxide and              
              Buckminster fullerine compounds as a function of hydrostatic                   
              pressure. Emphasis will be placed on the effect that pressure                  
              induced changes in the local oxygen ordering have on the                       
              superconducting transition temperature Tc. The results of this study           
              should lead to information on the mechanism(s) responsible for the             
              superconducting state and aid in the search for compounds with                 
              higher values of Tc.
