Abstract    :
                   Theoretical research in elementary particle physics will                  
              focus on studies of the decays of "charmed" or "beauty"                        
              particles, which contain one heavy quark and one light one.  A                 
              promising mix of theoretical tools will be brought to bear on                  
              these decays, which are complicated phenomena because of the                   
              interplay between strong and weak nuclear forces.  The decays are              
              very important, however, as probes of the nature of matter -                   
              antimatter asymmetry and of the weak interactions of the quarks.               
              Hence, this theoretical study can help to improve our                          
              understanding of the latter issues.
