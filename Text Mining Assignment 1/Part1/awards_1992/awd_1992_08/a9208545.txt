Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The goals of this project are to design reaction moldable, carbon              
              black macromonomers which can selectively and quantitatively remove            
              a wide range of trace contaminants from the environment and would              
              also permit for recovery and reuse.  This will be accomplished by              
              first controlling the chemical nature of both high and low surface             
              area carbon black particles to provide a range of acidic, basic,               
              neutral or high polar surfaces in the pores.  The investigator will            
              then introduce a variety of reactive units onto the surface of the             
              carbon black to make it behave as a polymerizable macromonomer.                
              This will be done through 1) chemical reactions, 2) reaction of                
              surface sites with oligomeric units such as resoles, or 3) through             
              coating with very thin polymeric films, such as polyacrylic acid.              
              These macromonomers will then be reaction molded to specific shapes            
              through crosslinking of the reactive groups on the surface.  This              
              new approach to environmental control could address most of the                
              limitations associated with the activated carbon systems typically             
              in use today.  Features to be investigated in depth include:  1)               
              the surface area changes associated with different chemical                    
              treatments, 2) the determination of mechanical properties of the               
              reaction molded macromonomers and the feasibility for reactivation             
              of these molded shapes through electrical resistance heating, 3)               
              the selective adsorption of trace contaminants using the various               
              chemically treated systems, 4) the design of graded depth filters              
              for particulate filtration in the range of 50-500A, and 5)                     
              separation of ionic aggregates where the surface of the                        
              interstitial opening is designed to display a specific ionic                   
              character.
