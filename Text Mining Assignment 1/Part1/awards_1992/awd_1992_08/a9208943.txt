Abstract    :
                   The main focus of this study is to acquire and interpret a                
              middle to late Pleistocene record of paleoclimate and the                      
              paleomagnetic field from nonmarine sediments in an effort to                   
              determine the effect of large and rapid climate changes on                     
              nonmarine systems.  The overall stratigraphy and chronology of the             
              sediments will be established using a multidisciplinary approach               
              including detailed lithologic descriptions, tephrochronology,                  
              radiometric age dating, and paleomagnetic correlations.                        
              Paleoclimate will be inferred from ostracod faunal analyses, pollen            
              floral analyses, and the geochemical analysis of ostracod shells.              
              The paleomagnetic work will a) established a causal relationship               
              between geomagnetic excursions and secular variations and b)                   
              established a high resolution "type section" paleomagnetic                     
              variations for the Pleistocene of western North America.
