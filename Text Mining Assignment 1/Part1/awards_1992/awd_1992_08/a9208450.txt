Abstract    :
              The structural properties of a range of materials, including                   
              quasicrystals, fullerenes, and high-temperature superconductors                
              will be investigated by x-ray and neutron diffraction experiments.             
              The project will also include computer modelling and simulation of             
              diffraction work, as well as theoretical collaborations in support             
              of the project.  The quasicrystal work will focus on alloys and                
              will provide data on the nature of defects and disorder, including             
              fluctuations in the tiling patterns invoked to interpret these                 
              materials.  Dynamic structural properties of fullerenes will be                
              investigated.  A further project involves structural investigations            
              using gazing angle x-ray scattering to investigate phase                       
              transitions in metallic alloys which are initiated at the surface.             
              Such transformations include martensitic phase transitions among               
              others.
