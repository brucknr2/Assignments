Abstract    :
              The purpose of this research is to produce more reliable and                   
              detailed estimates of the industrial distribution of the U.S.                  
              labor force for the nineteenth century than is currently                       
              available.  The project will estimate the number of male and                   
              female workers, by age category, and by urban and rural location,              
              engaged in the major industries within the nonfarm sector.  This               
              will be done for each state at each decennial census benchmark                 
              date in that century.  Regional and national totals will be                    
              derived as the sum of the state figures.  Of some importance is                
              the fact that these figures will be consistent with the most                   
              recent estimates of the total, farm, and nonfarm labor forces for              
              this period.                                                                   
                                                                                             
              The work will make extensive use of the Federal census data,                   
              supplemented, especially in the earlier years of the century, by               
              evidence from state censuses, city directories, and the research               
              of others on specific industries or locales.  The more detailed                
              censuses for 1850 through 1900 will provide the foundation of the              
              detailed breakdown.  Those details will be used to disaggregate                
              the evidence available in the 1820 and 1840 censuses.  In turn,                
              that fuller set of data will be used to estimate the figures for               
              1800, 1810 and 1830.                                                           
                                                                                             
              These detailed figures will permit more careful analysis of a                  
              number of issues important to a full understanding of the growth               
              and evolution of the U.S. economy.  These include estimation of                
              the nation's output in the years 1800 through 1840, estimation of              
              the regional breakdown of output, analysis of the nation's and                 
              the regions'sources of economic growth, and analysis of the rise               
              of the service economy.
