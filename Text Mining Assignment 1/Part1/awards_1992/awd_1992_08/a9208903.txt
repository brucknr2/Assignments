Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The primary objective of this proposal is to continue excavations              
              in Tugen Hills, west of Lake Baringo, Kenya.  This region contains             
              an excellent series of fossiliferous geological strata dating to               
              the period of 16 to approximately 1.5 million years ago; a time of             
              major significance in the evolution of the higher primates and                 
              bracketing the time of appearance of the first hominids or human               
              ancestors.  The project has already discovered new primate                     
              specimens as well as remains of other mammalian fossils.  In total,            
              these specimens are elucidating not only the anatomical details of             
              the development of various higher primates, but also setting them              
              within an environmental context, thus clarifying the conditions                
              which molded the species' evolution.  Further fossiliferous sites              
              will be identified while currently known sites will continue to be             
              excavated.
