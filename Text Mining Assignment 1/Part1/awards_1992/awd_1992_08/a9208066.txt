Abstract    :
                   This project continues collaborative research between                     
              astronomers and statisticians with the objective of developing                 
              specifically useful statistical procedures for the analysis of                 
              multivariate data sets that arise in observational astronomy.  It              
              addresses the statistical problems of estimation of a bivariate                
              distribution function under random censoring, censored                         
              regression, testing for multivariate normality under random                    
              censoring and a new analysis for statistical independence.                     
                   Statistical analysis can elucidate astrophysical processes                
              which are detectable only from data obtained from a sample of                  
              celestial objects.  Using modern statistical theory and                        
              methodology, some of the obscuring distortions which are                       
              inevitable in such data can be "removed" to make the most                      
              physically meaningful relations more apparent.  For example, the               
              relations between luminosity, size, rotation and metallicity in                
              elliptical galaxies can be examined and described.  This                       
              collaborative research focuses on the development of new methods               
              that carry the potential for major advances in both statistics                 
              and astronomy.
