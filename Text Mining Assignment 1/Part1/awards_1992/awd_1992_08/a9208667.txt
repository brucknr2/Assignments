Abstract    :
                   This award supports research in finite group representation               
              theory.  The principal investigator will investigate the many                  
              correlations between group-theoretic structure and the                         
              representation theory of finite groups.  In particular, he will                
              work on Alperin's weight conjecture and Brauer's k(B) problem.                 
                   The research supported concerns the representation theory of              
              finite groups.  A group is an algebraic object used to study                   
              transformations.  Because of this, groups are a fundamental tool               
              in physics, chemistry and computer science as well as                          
              mathematics.  Representation theory is an important method for                 
              determining the structure of groups.
