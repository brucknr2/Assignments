Abstract    :
              The research will study biochemical messengers in the insect                   
              (grasshopper) grazer digestive tract and test the hypothesis that              
                                                                                             
                                                                                             
              as a result of herbivory, plants respond to these messengers with              
                                                                                             
                                                                                             
              altered plant growth responses and productivity.  The work will                
                                                                                             
              identify these putative messengers and to test them in plant                   
              bioassays, utilizing coleoptile responses, sorghum seedling and                
                                                                                             
              whole plant responses, and a grazing-sensitive grass, Pancium                  
              coloratum.  The study will test whether "Epidermal Growth Factor"              
                                                                                             
                                                                                             
              (EGF), a peptidal growth factor in mammals and recently                        
              identified in grasshoppers is the messenger and whether plants                 
              have specific cell receptors to EGF.  This work will provide                   
              important new information for ecological work on the                           
              relationships between plants and animals in natural and                        
              agricultural ecosystems.
