Abstract    :
                   This RUI grant to a Hope College faculty member supports                  
              research in the study of correlated fragments from the decay                   
              of the compound nucleus formed in heavy ion reactions.  The                    
              measurements help to determine the time and spatial extent of                  
              the decaying nuclear system.  Undergraduate students                           
              participate in the construction of apparatus, execution of the                 
              experiments at national user facilities, and analysis of the                   
              data.
