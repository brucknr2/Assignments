Abstract    :
              This workshop is and NSF-initiated planning workshop to                        
              determine research problems in the area of spoken language                     
              understanding that deserve future funding.  The main goals of the              
              workshop are: (a) it identifies the most important areas of                    
              research in speech and natural language understanding, with                    
              particular attention to those not currently addressed by NSF or                
              other funding agencies; (b) to determine how NSF can benefit from              
              other programs, such as the DARPA speech and natural language                  
              program, and yet distinguish itself from these programs; and (c)               
              to produce a set of recommendations to NSF to help guide funding               
              opportunities.  The workshop participants represent a balance of               
              researchers in the areas of speech recognition, natural language               
              understanding and human computer interaction.  Participants                    
              include researchers with NSF grants and researchers in government              
              and industrial laboratories.  The workshop will consist of                     
              plenary sessions and breakout groups focused on three research                 
              areas:  robust systems; the interaction of speech and natural                  
              language; and human-computer interaction.
