Abstract    :
              The Theoretical and Computational Chemistry Program in the                     
              Chemistry Division is supporting a project at Clarkson                         
              University under the supervision of Dr. Larry Eno on the                       
              theoretical study of laser-induced transitions between                         
              electronic surfaces in reactive molecular collisions.  The                     
              extent to which the laser field can be used as a probe of the                  
              dynamics of a collinear reaction is being studied with regard                  
              to variation in the laser intensity, field frequency,                          
              polarization, collision energy, internal energy, and other                     
              factors. Complications such as rotating wave breakdown and                     
              multi-electronic surface effects are being considered.

              A major current problem in chemical physics is to obtain                       
              greater understanding of what actually happens during the                      
              course of a chemical reaction, i.e., during the short time in                  
              which reacting molecules approach each other, pass through an                  
              intermediate transition stage, and separate as products.  This                 
              project is a theoretical investigation to determine how laser                  
              probes can be used to provide information during this brief                    
              period.
