Abstract    :
              The focus of this research involves the development of a                       
              process which allows the electrochemical reduction of a redox                  
              mediator at an electrode in an aqueous medium containing an                    
              enzyme, an alpha-keto acid and an ammonia source.  The reduced                 
              mediator will reduce the enzyme to its active state which will,                
              in turn, react with the alpha-keto acid to afford the desired                  
              amino acid in optically active form.  Optimization of the                      
              process could provide an economically competitive,                             
              environmentally benign method for the commercial production of                 
              amino acids.

              With this award the Synthetic Organic Program of the Chemistry                 
              Division and the Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI) are                  
              co-supporting the research of Dr. Albert J. Fry and Dr. Susan                  
              B. Sobolov of Wesleyan University and Dr. James M. Fenton of                   
              the University of Connecticut.  The focus of the research,                     
              sponsored under the NSF/EPRI initiative on Research in                         
              Electrochemical Synthesis, is the development of an                            
              electrochemical-enzymatic process for the synthesis of                         
              alpha-amino acids.
