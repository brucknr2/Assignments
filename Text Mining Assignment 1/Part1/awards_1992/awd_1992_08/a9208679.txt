Abstract    :
              This grant will support the second annual West Coast Operator                  
              Algebra Seminar to be held at the University of Nevada on October              
              24-25, 1992.                                                                   
                   The general area of mathematics of this project has its                   
              basis                                                                          
              in the theory of algebras of Hilbert space operators.  Operators               
              can be thought of as finite or infinite matrices of complex                    
              numbers.  Special types of operators are often put together in an              
              algebra, naturally called an operator algebra.  These abstract                 
              objects have a surprising variety of applications.  For example,               
              they play a key role in knot theory, which in turn is  currently               
              being used to study the structure of DNA, and they are of                      
              fundamental importance in noncommutative geometry, which is                    
              becoming increasingly important in physics.
