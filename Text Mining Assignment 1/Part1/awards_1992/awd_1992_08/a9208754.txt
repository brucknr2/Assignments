Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Biologists since Darwin have sought to understand how extreme male             
              display traits function.  Among species with exaggerated male                  
              display, bowerbirds are especially well suited for analysis because            
              (1) their unique display allows experimental manipulation of                   
              display components, (2) patterns of display differ greatly in                  
              closely related species, and (3) they are one of the few kinds of              
              animals for which the details of female choice are well known.                 
                                                                                             
              Dr. Borgia will develop a biochemical phylogeny of bowerbirds based            
              on comparisons of mitochondrial DNA.  In the field, he will observe            
              display and experimentally manipulate conditions under which it                
              occurs for four species.  This comparative information can be used             
              (1) to reconstruct the historical sequence by which complex display            
              traits evolved and (2) to carry out novel tests of hypotheses about            
              the operation of female choice.                                                
                                                                                             
              This project is the first attempt to use comparisons within a group            
              of related species to evaluate recent models for the evolution of              
              female choice and extreme male display.  This study should help                
              provide critical information for developing a general model for                
              mate-choice patterns in animals.  Such knowledge can have important            
              economic applications in species preservation, pest control, game              
              management, and animal breeding.
