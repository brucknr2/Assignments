Abstract    :
                   This award to Professors Lipsman, Adams, Herb, Kudla, Li,                 
              Rosenberg is made under the Mathematical Sciences Research Group               
              initiative.  It will support postdocs, graduate students, and                  
              visitors in a series of collaborative projects in representation               
              theory.  Specific topics include theta correspondence, dual                    
              pairs, and applications to automorphic forms.                                  
                   The research will deal with various aspects of the                        
              representation theory of Lie groups.  Lie groups, named in honor               
              of the Norwegian mathematician Sophus Lie, has been one of the                 
              major themes in twentieth century mathematics.  As the                         
              mathematical vehicle for exploiting the symmetries inherent in a               
              system, the representation theory of Lie groups has had a                      
              profound impact upon mathematics itself, particularly in analysis              
              and number theory, and upon theoretical physics, especially                    
              quantum mechanics and elementary particle physics.
