Abstract    :
              Under an SGER award a search will be made for ultra-low friction               
              materials.  The work is based on the premise that very smooth and              
              very hard surfaces of materials which do not deform by                         
              dislocation movement, by cracking, or by large elastic                         
              deformation hysteresis due to molecular movement could have                    
              extremely low friction.  To test this hypothesis a number of                   
              highly cross-linked, covalently bonded elastomers will be sought               
              out and their frictional properties related to their bond                      
              structure.
