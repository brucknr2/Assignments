Abstract    :
              The design of globally synchronous systems must account for clock              
              skew due to propagation delays through a distribution network.  In             
              large or fast systems, electrical path delays must be individually             
              equalized, a tedious and error-prone process.  Alternatively,                  
              systems can be designed in an asynchronous or clockless form, but              
              asynchronous design is not currently or widely understood or                   
              practiced.  Therefore, improved technology for distribution of                 
              clock signals continues to be important for high-performance                   
              systems.                                                                       
                                                                                             
              Sinusoidal clock signals in the form of standing waves on the                  
              clock-distribution conductors can substantially eliminate clock                
              skew across a system.  This has been operationally demonstrated in             
              a branching tree of transmission lines in the Pixel-Planes 5                   
              system, where a 160 MHz clock is distributed across a three-rack               
              system with less than 200 ps skew.                                             
                                                                                             
              The work in this project will allow generalization to surfaces,                
              suggesting the design of synchronous PC boards using clock planes              
              for low-complexity and low-skew clock distribution.  A series of               
              experiments and circuit developments are being performed to reduce             
              the clock-plane concept to engineering practice.  The expected                 
              results of this research effort consist of a design methodology                
              that is both simple and reliable, supported by a library of basic              
              circuits and CAD tools.
