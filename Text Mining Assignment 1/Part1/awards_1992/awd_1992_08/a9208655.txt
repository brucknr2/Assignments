Abstract    :
                   This grant covers Accelerator Physics research and                        
              development by Professor Hand at Cornell University.  He will                  
              study the laser-stimulated emission of electrons from the                      
              surface of a superconducting RF cavity.  The technique has the                 
              potential for creating the most intense electron sources with                  
              the smallest phase space.  Applications to electron linacs                     
              will be studied.
