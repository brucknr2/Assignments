Abstract    :
              We propose to conduct a study of the sources due to mesoscale                  
              variability of gravity waves at mesospheric heights.  The                      
              mesospheric wind data for this study will be obtained from an HF               
              radar installed on the island of Kauai, Hawaii in September of                 
              1990.  Gravity wave activity observed from this radar will be                  
              examined with reference to possible frontal, convective, and jet               
              stream wave sources.  We intend to use synoptic, radiosonde, and               
              satellite imaging data in the search for these sources.  We will               
              also conduct a critical examination of the spaced antenna drift                
              (SAD) technique in regard to measuring winds in the middle                     
              atmosphere.
