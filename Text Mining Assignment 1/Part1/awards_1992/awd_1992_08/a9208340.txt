Abstract    :
                   The investigator applies computer modelling to the                        
              investigation of the fluid dynamics of aquatic animal propulsion.              
              She has developed a reliable computational model in which the                  
              fluid motion is described by the incompressible Navier-Stokes                  
              equations, and the immersed organism is modelled by an immersed                
              elastic structure undergoing time-dependent motions.  No inherent              
              restriction is imposed on the Reynolds number of the flow, on the              
              geometry of the swimming organism, nor on the complexity of the                
              swimming motion.  Moreover, fluid dynamic interactions of                      
              multiple organisms in in the same domain of fluid can be studied.              
                   The goal of this research is to extend the simulations                    
              to different modes of swimming such as jet propulsion, as well                 
              as rowing and undulatory motion and to extend the model to                     
              three dimensions, where more realistic and complex motions can                 
              be studied.  The project includes the effect of buoyancy on                    
              the swimming of microorganisms, so one may study the phenomena                 
              of geotaxis, the orientation of movement with respect to                       
              gravity, both in single organisms and in collective swimming.                  
                   One step in understanding the evolutionary adaptations of                 
              aquatic animals, as well as the biochemical properties associated              
              with microorganisms, is understanding the mechanical and                       
              hydrodynamical implications of different swimming morphologies                 
              and motions.  This project provides the first computational model              
              of aquatic animal locomotion solves the full Navier-Stokes                     
              equations that describe the motion of the organism in the fluid.
