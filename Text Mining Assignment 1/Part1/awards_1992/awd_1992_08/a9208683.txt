Abstract    :
                   This project addresses the mathematical representation of                 
              arrays of biological neurons that are firing simultaneously with               
              the goal of inferring their causal connections or influence                    
              diagram on the basis of firing times.  The methodology of point                
              processes of several types will be extended to include full                    
              likelihood and second-order procedures to extend the results from              
              social scientists' path analysis and causal modeling.  For small               
              net works of two or three neurons, partial coherence analysis and              
              threshold modeling have proved effective; however, for data for a              
              larger network with eight neurons, nontrivial extensions are                   
              needed for display and for analysis.                                           
                   Physiologically, neurons communicate with each other via                  
              spike trains, emitting pulses that go on to influence other                    
              neurons; and the neurons are themselves influenced.  The goal of               
              this research is to infer the connection lines or "wiring                      
              diagram" of a network of neurons by observing their individual                 
              firing times.
