Abstract    :
                   To understand how large populations of neurons function, the              
              investigator will develop mathematical tools for describing and                
              analyzing collective network behavior.  Models that account for                
              the spatial and temporal structure of firing patterns in large                 
              neural populations will be developed and studied.   Population                 
              behavior will be tied to and derived from the electrical and                   
              geometric properties of individual neurons.  Reduction methods                 
              will be used to streamline the analysis while retaining varying                
              degrees of detail.   New developments in cable theory will be                  
              used to explore the effects of dendritic structure and synaptic                
              placement on input integration.  A newly developed reduction                   
              scheme for conductance-based neuron models will allow the                      
              dynamics of ionic currents to be included and reflected in                     
              spiking rates and patterns.  Both firing-rate models and models                
              that explore the temporal structure of population firing will be               
              investigated.  Almost all of the cognitive functions in the brain              
              are performed by large population of neurons working                           
              collectively.  To understand how these cognitive processes work                
              requires developing techniques for describing and analyzing the                
              behavior of large neuronal populations.  This project will use                 
              mathematical and statistical methods to study the dynamics of                  
              large populations of neurons, focusing in particular on the                    
              problem of extending knowledge about the properties of single                  
              neurons and their synaptic connections to full neural networks.
