Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Localized optical-phonon modes are expected to occur in gallium                
              (aluminum) arsenide quantum-well structures and would be important             
              due their strong interaction with current-carrying electrons.  They            
              propose to examine their unique dynamical properties.  Long-term               
              objectives are to study the effects of interface roughness and                 
              dynamic electron screening as well as to explore the possible                  
              generation of non-equilibrium phonon distributions.

              This research will have a direct impact on the design of new                   
              electronic devices of a type that are already revolutionizing                  
              microelectronics technology in the areas of semiconductor lasers               
              and optical communications.
