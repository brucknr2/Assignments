Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  Computer model assessments of the atmospheric chemistry and               
              air quality of the past, present, and future rely in part on                   
              inventories of emissions constructed on appropriate spatial and                
              temporal scales and with appropriate chemical species.  The                    
              production of such global inventories is the task of the Global                
              Emissions Inventories Activity (GEIA) of the International Global              
              Atmospheric Chemistry Project (IGAC).  In support of this activity,            
              the GEIA Management Committee proposes funding for the following:              
              a two-year postdoctoral position for the organization and                      
              coordination of between five and ten project committees developing             
              specific inventories, part-time supervision and support for the                
              GEIA data management effort to make these inventories internally               
              consistent widely available, and travel funds for US and developing            
              world participants to attend three workshops at which the emissions            
              inventories will be produced and discussed.
