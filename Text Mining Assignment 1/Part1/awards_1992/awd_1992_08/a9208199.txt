Abstract    :
                   This research is concerned with a unified approach to                     
              classification problems for torsion, torsion-free, and mixed                   
              abelian groups.  The principal investigator will continue                      
              studying Axiom 3 and equivalence theorems in an effort to access               
              the torsion-free and mixed cases.  He is also experimenting with               
              refined concepts of purity to make techniques originally aimed at              
              specific classes of abelian groups more universally useful.                    
                   This project is in the general area of abelian group theory               
              and is concerned with the classification of abelian groups.                    
              Although the classification of finite abelian groups has been                  
              well understood for a century, the classification of infinite                  
              abelian groups remains elusive.  This research involves this old               
              problem of classification of the infinite abelian groups                       
              approached by new tools from logic and analysis.
