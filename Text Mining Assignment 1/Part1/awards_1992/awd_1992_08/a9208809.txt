Abstract    :
              The object of this workshop is the evaluation of underwater                    
              vehicle technology through the use of competitive scenarios.  The              
              workshop will bring together the experience and knowledge of                   
              autonomous underwater vehicle technology with the experience that              
              has been gained through the International Submarine Race program               
              to foster innovation and technology development through                        
              competition.  The subject is sufficiently complex and has                      
              attracted a very large degree of interest so that a workshop of                
              invited experts is the best method to advance the concept to                   
              practice.  This approach will be employed to examine the process               
              of utilizing competition to foster and evaluate technical                      
              advances and as a result to develop scenarios with which to                    
              characterize, evaluate and advance the state of the art of                     
              Autonomous Underwater Vehicles.  The results of the workshop will              
              provide the basis for competition based programs for technology                
              enhancement and evaluation in the future.
