Abstract    :
              The current tsunami histories for                                              
              Alaska and Hawaii are inadequate                                               
              for making decisions on tsunami                                                
              warnings, inundation mapping and                                               
              other tsunami mitigation measures.                                             
              The errors introduced through                                                  
              repeated compilations, the                                                     
              omissions of detail in ensuing

              to the scope and purposes of the                                               
              ordinal compilations and subsequent                                            
              studies, and the original material                                             
              overlooked and omitted from each                                               
              compilation all combine to obscure                                             
              the real nature of the hazard.                                                 
              This project, together with work                                               
              that is being done on the West
