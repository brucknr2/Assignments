Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Experiments are proposed on the details of vapor-adsorption at the             
              free surface of a binary liquid mixture.  On approaching the liquid            
              critical temperature, the adsorption also becomes "critical"; its              
              "profile" (CAP) has been the object of much research, both                     
              theoretical and experimental, in recent years.  There are numerous             
              practical consequences such as the particular behavior of colloids             
              and of liquid mixtures in random media.  They propose to examine               
              some of the important questions re CAP using the sensitive                     
              technique of evanescent-wave ellipsometry (EWE).
