Abstract    :
                   A conference entitled 'Baryons 92; International                          
              Conference on the Structure of Baryons and Related Mesons'                     
              will be held at Yale University on June 1-4, 1992.  This                       
              conference will provide a forum for new developments in both                   
              theory and experiment related to research planned at CEBAF,                    
              RHIC, and other high energy nuclear physics facilities.  NSF                   
              support will allow students and young researchers in the field                 
              to attend this important meeting.
