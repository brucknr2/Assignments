Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Flight in insects is a sophisticated behavior which requires an                
              array of physiological and morphological specializations. Flight               
              behavior provides a convenient system for investigating temporally             
              precise neural processes, as well as novel aerodynamic mechanisms.             
              The research to be done under this award to Dr. Michael Dickinson              
              focuses on the flight control of insects at several levels of                  
              analysis: from the physiological properties of identified neurons              
              and muscles to the mechanics of wings and resultant production of              
              aerodynamic forces. The work will characterize the neural circuitry            
              and flight forces underlying a specific steroetyped component of               
              flight control behavior which involves the rapid rotation of the               
              wings during the transition from downstroke to upstroke which is               
              modulated during turning manuevers. The timing may be controlled               
              by a specific steering muscle whose output is modified by both                 
              rapid sensory feedback from receptors on the wings as well as                  
              visual input descending from the head. The circuitry will be                   
              studied by intracellular recording from motor neurons during                   
              controlled stimulation of sensory pathways. The effects of muscle              
              stimulation on wing rotation will also be tested. The flight                   
              apparatus will be equipped with a torque balance, so that the                  
              aerodynamic forces can be directly correlated with changes in the              
              timing of the flight locomotion. This research will contribute to              
              the understanding of rapid sensory-motor processing and aerodynamic            
              mechanisms of flight.
