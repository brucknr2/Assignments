Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Particulate and quantum-size heterojunctions are used as a                     
              means of promoting charge-carrier separation to specific                       
              spatially separated regions on a host titania photoconductor.                  
              Quantum yields for the mineralization of a model reactant                      
              mixture consisting of trichloroethylene, water, oxygen, and                    
              inert carrier gas on titania heterojunction photocatalysts,                    
              with the reactants delivered as vapors or gases, are                           
              correlated with the charge-carrier separation distances; the                   
              charge-carrier separation distance, in turn is a function of                   
              the composition and configuration of the heterojunction.                       
              Transport properties of optically generated charge carriers in                 
              particulate or colloidal catalysts are thought to be important                 
              in determining reaction pathways and kinetics.  Separation of                  
              photoelectrons from photoholes over distances exceeding simple                 
              charge transfer to adjacent atoms is frequently suggested as a                 
              way to prevent recombination and thusly increase quantum                       
              yields; this is the first direct test of such a concept.                       
              Time-resolved photocharge (TRPC) measurements, time-resolved                   
              microwave photoconductivity (TRMC) determinations, time-                       
              resolved absorption and desorption, and diffuse reflectance                    
              spectroscopy are used.                                                         
                                                                                             
              This work has applications to heterogeneous photocatalysis,                    
              photographic imaging, photovoltaic energy conversion,                          
              photoelectronic devices, environmental control, and water                      
              purification, including the specific system being                              
              investigated, namely the photocatalyzed oxidative degradation                  
              of organic pollutants on particulate or colloidal                              
              semiconductors.
