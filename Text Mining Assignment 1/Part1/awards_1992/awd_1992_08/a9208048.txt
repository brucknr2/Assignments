Abstract    :
                   The purpose of the research is to study the properties of                 
              numerical methods for ordinary and functional differential                     
              equations and Volterra integral and integrodifferential                        
              equations.  An efficient and reliable general purpose algorithm                
              for the numerical solution of neutral delay-differential                       
              equations and Volterra integro-differential equations based on                 
              variable stepsize variable order Adams formulas will be                        
              developed.  The asymptotic behavior of recurrence relations                    
              resulting from application of various numerical methods to                     
              Volterra integral and integro-differential equations with                      
              nonconvolution kernels will be studied.  Moreover, convergence,                
              order and stability properties of time-point relaxations and                   
              waveform relaxation Runge-Kutta methods for large systems of                   
              ordinary differential equations will be examined.  These methods               
              are appropriate in a parallel computing environment.  Finally,                 
              variable stepsize two-step Runge-Kutta methods for differential                
              equations will be investigated.  One of the main applications of               
              these methods is to provide efficient error estimates for                      
              continuous Runge-Kutta methods.                                                
                   This research is in the area of numerical analysis, which                 
              has applications to a wide variety of physical and engineering                 
              applications.
