Abstract    :
              This is a study of the vibrational modes of zeolitic                           
              frameworks, specifically those of zeolites of the faujasite                    
              group.  The vibrations of a framework aluminosilicate can be                   
              divided into two general classes:  "internal" modes of the MO4                 
              tetrahedra, and "external" modes associated with structures                    
              built from the tetrahedral units; examples of the latter                       
              include vibrations of the pore openings and the cages of                       
              zeolites.  High-pressure studies of Raman spectroscopy,                        
              infrared spectroscopy, and X-ray diffraction are used to                       
              separate external and internal modes; this is possible because                 
              external modes are altered dramatically by compression, while                  
              internal modes are unperturbed.                                                
                                                                                             
              The assignments made in this study are very useful for                         
              determining the structures of unknown zeolites and for                         
              studying the energetics and steric effects of adsorbates in                    
              zeolites.  They also offer a convenient validity check for                     
              computer simulations of zeolite sorption and structure.
