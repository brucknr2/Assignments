Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This program is a fundamental study of the microstructure derived              
              from rapid solidification processing of metals.  The velocity of               
              motion of the planar interface that separates the liquid and solid             
              is measured.  Laser pulsing is employed to create a one dimensional            
              melting pattern on thin films deposited on insulating substrates.              
              Interface motion, undercooling, and solute trapping are determined.            
              The experimental data should provide a quantitative test of                    
              theories for the interface velocity/undercooling function.

              This research examines non-equilibrium conditions created by rapid             
              solidification processing techniques, such as laser melting, ion               
              implantation, and plasma spraying.  The goal is to develop improved            
              predictive capabilities for the material microstructure and                    
              chemical segregation that results from the processing.
