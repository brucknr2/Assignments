Abstract    :
              In this Experimental Physical Chemistry project, sponsored by                  
              the Chemistry Division, Prof. Anderson (SUNY Stonybrook) will                  
              develop a new and powerful method for preparing polyatomic ions                
              in specific excited vibrational states. The effect of specific                 
              vibrational excitation on ion reactivity will then be studied                  
              by high resolution molecular beam methods. The primary question                
              to be answered is, "in what range of molecular size and                        
              vibrational energy are vibrational mode effects important?" A                  
              clear answer to this question will determine the future course                 
              of research in this field for many years to come.                              
              %%%                                                                            
              Bonds which hold molecules together are not rigid; they stretch                
              and vibrate. A long sought goal of physical chemistry is to                    
              influence the course of chemical reactions by stimulating                      
              specific vibrations in order to facilitate breaking specific                   
              bonds. Prof. Anderson (SUNY Stonybrook) will develop a new                     
              method for doing this using simultaneous irradiation by lasers                 
              of two different wavelengths. This is important because the                    
              method can be applied to larger and more chemically relevant                   
              molecules than was previously possible.
