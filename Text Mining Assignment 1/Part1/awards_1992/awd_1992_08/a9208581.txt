Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The goal of this research project is to provide a comprehensive                
              empirical assessment of the "lending" channel of monetary policy               
              transmission.  According to the lending view, monetary policy                  
              matters not only because of its effect on transactions balances,               
              but also because of its impact on the supply of bank loans.                    
              Critical to the existence of a distinct lending channel is the                 
              condition that bank loans and other forms of credit, e.g., open                
              market paper and trade credit, be imperfect substitutes for some               
              borrowers.  In other words, there can only be a distinct lending               
              channel if some borrowers are partially "bank dependent."                      
                                                                                             
              The contribution of this project comes from a through examination              
              of both the aggregate and cross-sectional implications of the                  
              lending view.  Using aggregate data, the investigators test: 1)                
              whether monetary policy can indeed move loan supply around; and 2)             
              whether these movements in loan supply in turn have meaningful                 
              consequences for investment in capital goods and inventories.  The             
              project uses micro data to determine whether the large inventory               
              swings typically seen in recessions can be attributed to monetary-             
              policy-induced changes in loan supply.  The project determines                 
              whether bank-dependent firms cut their inventories more sharply                
              than do non-bank dependent firms in the wake of a monetary                     
              contraction.  Micro data is also used to study the responsiveness              
              of inter-firm trade credit extensions to monetary shocks.
