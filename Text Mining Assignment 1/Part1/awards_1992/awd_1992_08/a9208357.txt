Abstract    :
                   This action provides funding to coordinate and carry out all              
              phases of a planning effort for a conference to showcase the                   
              highly successful Industry/University Cooperative Research                     
              Centers (I/UCRC) Program established 20 years ago.  The                        
              conference will be for an audience of 300-500 people                           
              representing current industrial, state, and federal supporters of              
              the I/UCRCs; leaders of industrial organizations not now members               
              of any of the I/UCRCs; representatives of state agencies not now               
              supporting I/UCRCs in their states; members of Congress and their              
              staff; and appropriate representatives of the Executive Branch of              
              the federal government; presidents and vice presidents for                     
              research from academia; and representatives of the media. Major                
              goals of the conference will be to provide to the industrial                   
              participants insights on the role such centers might play in                   
              supporting the goals of their industry; to inform Congress of the              
              activities of the I/UCRCs in promoting the nation's industrial                 
              growth; to demonstrate the progress made in conducting an                      
              extensive program of industrially relevant research; and to                    
              demonstrate how much of the past research has resulted in new                  
              products and processes.  A steering committee will oversee the                 
              planning of the conference and will work together to ensure that               
              the goals of the conference are met.                                           
                   The Program Manager recommends funding of this planning                   
              proposal in the amount of $79,568 for one year.
