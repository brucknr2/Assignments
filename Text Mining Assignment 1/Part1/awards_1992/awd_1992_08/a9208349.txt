Abstract    :
                   An award to Professor J. Winicour of Pittsburgh                           
              University is recommended to enable him to develop reliable                    
              computational codes for the theoretical analysis of                            
              gravitational radiation expected to be generated from the                      
              collision of neutron stars and the coalescence of black holes.                 
              The sought for time profile of gravitational wave amplitudes                   
              from binary black hole systems is important information for                    
              increasing the sensitivity of gravitational antennae by                        
              filtering the signal from the noise.
