Abstract    :
              The development of molecular biology techniques - including                    
              the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) - has increased                            
              dramatically the rate at which new proteins are identified,                    
              characterized, sequenced, and expressed in milligram                           
              amounts.  However, further progress in many of the systems                     
              created by these new technologies is being hampered by the                     
              lack of  3-D structural information.  Multidimensional NMR                     
              methods have helped to release this bottleneck, but for many                   
              systems, especially those involving proteins of 18KD or                        
              larger, x-ray diffraction analysis is still the best                           
              technique available for atomic structure determination.  Our                   
              Department is in the process of expanding and the addition                     
              of new faculty is placing excessive demand on our x-ray data                   
              collection equipment.  We must therefor expand our data                        
              collection capabilities in order to provide adequate access                    
              to all members of our department.  In this application we                      
              propose to purchase a new data collection system consisting                    
              of a rotating anode, an image plate system and a cooling                       
              device.  This system, in addition to effectively doubling                      
              our present data collection throughput, will allow us to                       
              collect better high resolution data and to improve the                         
              accuracy of anomalous dispersion measurements.
