Abstract    :
                   Laser interferometer gravitational wave detectors have                    
              their end mirrors mounted on pendulums to isolate them from                    
              disturbances.  Research will be carried out on methods for                     
              very strongly isolating the support points for the pendulums                   
              from ground motions at frequencies of 1 to 10 Hz.  A                           
              preliminary isolation stage is now being constructed, and two                  
              additional stages with much lower noise will be designed,                      
              built and tested.  With all three stages operating together,                   
              the final isolated platform will have lower displacement and                   
              tilt noise than ever has been achieved before.  Then, the                      
              final platform will be used to suspend two pendulums so that                   
              the effects of thermally generated noise in the pendulum                       
              support wires can be measured directly.                                        
                                                                                             
              The goal of this research is to find practical ways of                         
              supporting the mirrors in gravitational wave detectors so that                 
              the noise in the mirror separation at frequencies of 1 to 10                   
              Hz can be reduced to the unavoidable effects of locally                        
              generated gravitational fields from density fluctuations in                    
              the ground and the air.  This will aid in detecting                            
              gravitational wave signals from astronomical sources which do                  
              not radiate strongly at higher frequencies.  The low frequency                 
              isolation methods developed are likely to be useful in                         
              industry and in other scientific measurements.
