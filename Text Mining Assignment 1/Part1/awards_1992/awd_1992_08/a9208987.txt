Abstract    :
              This project is in the general area of analytical and surface                  
              chemistry and in the subfield of electroanalytical chemistry.                  
              During the tenure of this two-year continuing grant, Professor                 
              Osteryoung and her students will apply pulse voltammetric                      
              techniques to the quantification of benzodiazepines, to the study              
              of the interactions of ions with cyclodextrins, and to the                     
              electrolytic formation of thin films.  Specific experimental                   
              systems to be investigated include complexation of                             
              ferrocenecarboxylic acid and heme entities by cyclodextrins,                   
              development of methods for benzodiazepine analysis in nonaqueous               
              media, novel applications of monodisperse spheres to the study of              
              mass transport in electrochemical systems, and                                 
              electrocrystallization of Ba-Cu-O superconductors.

              This research will expand the knowledge base and broaden practical             
              utilization of fundamental electrochemistry.  Related areas that               
              will benefit from this work include pharmacoanalysis, enzyme                   
              modeling, and high temperature superconducting materials.
