Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Bayesian theory specifies how sets of probabilities should merge to            
              a common opinion under the effects of Bayes' rules applied to                  
              shared evidence.  This pooling provides a robustness in that after             
              the data are obtained, decisions can be taken without knowing which            
              prior opinion was used.  Also, it suggests asymptotic theories                 
              which use sets of probabilities rather than a single probability to            
              represent a belief can share some of the properties of a strict                
              Bayesian theory.  Less familiar, and the focus of this project, is             
              the phenomenon called 'dilation' for sets of probabilities.                    
              Dilation occurs when, regardless of the evidence, the set of                   
              posterior probabilities for a given even properly contains the set             
              of prior probabilities for that event, as in, for example,                     
              sequential decision making.  Thus, dilation is the opposite                    
              phenomenon to the merging of sets of probabilities.  This project              
              raises sever questions about the importance of dilation for                    
              sequential decisions, and in particular, for the Harsanyi-Selten               
              theory of sequential games.  The project delineates how sequential             
              decisions differ from normal decisions when dilation is present.               
              Also to be examined are issues concerning independence and                     
              contaminated models.
