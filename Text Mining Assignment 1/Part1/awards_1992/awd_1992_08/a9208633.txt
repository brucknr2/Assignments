Abstract    :
                   Experimental work on the properties of atoms in specific                  
              excited states will be undertaken.  These include the                          
              photoionization of excited atoms, atomic collisions of excited                 
              atoms and the study of atomic energy levels in Stark fields.  The              
              work is closely tied to ongoing theoretical efforts and involves               
              the participation of a number of undergraduates and secondary                  
              school teachers.
