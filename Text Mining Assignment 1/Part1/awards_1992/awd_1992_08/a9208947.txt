Abstract    :
                This award funds a research planning workshop on machine                     
              learning and computer vision, to be held in Harper's Ferry, West               
              Virginia, on October 15-17, 1992.  Research in some laboratories               
              is beginning to make progress toward introduction of learning                  
              capabilities into computer vision systems.  There is a growing                 
              interest in interaction between the learning and computer vision               
              research communities.  This workshop will provide a forum for                  
              leading researchers from both fields to come together to identify              
              concepts and approaches in machine learning that have promise for              
              application to vision, and to develop a research agenda to                     
              advance the use of learning in computer vision systems.  A report              
              summarizing the current state of the art and outlining research                
              opportunities and priorities will be produced and widely                       
              distributed.
