Abstract    :
                   This project is concerned with research in theoretical,                   
              computational and applied aspects of a class of partial                        
              differential equations, known as nonhomogeneous Cauchy-Riemann                 
              equations. Fast, accurate and parallelizable algorithms for                    
              solving these equations in simple and complicated regions will be              
              developed. Basic computational modules based on the theory of                  
              these algorithms will developed and implemented on serial and                  
              parallel computers. Emphasis will be placed on the use of vector               
              computers such as CRAY-YMP as well as parallel machines such as                
              SEQUENT and NCUBE. These algorithms will be used to solve                      
              compressible flow problems and to generate quasiconformal                      
              mappings.                                                                      
                   The theory of these algorithms makes use of analysis based                
              on complex variables. This makes these algorithms elegant and the              
              computational procedure semianalytical. Beside, these algorithms               
              are extremely fast, highly accurate, easy to implement, and                    
              parallelizable.                                                                
                   The basic computational tools based on these algorithms will              
              be made user friendly and portable so that these can be applied                
              with ease in many pure and applied areas including quasiconformal              
              mappings, fluid flows and inverse problems.
