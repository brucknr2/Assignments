Abstract    :
                   Prior beliefs can be characterized using ideas of partial                 
              exchangeability by describing certain convex sets of proba-                    
              bilities in terms of their symmetry properties using deFinetti's               
              theorem as a paradigm.  Statistical procedures suggested by                    
              priors will also be examined using usual frequentist criteria                  
              like consistency and asymptotic normality.  Tests of the                       
              assumptions for statistical models useful for policy analysis                  
              will be considered and the performance of such models under                    
              failure of these assumptions will evaluated.                                   
                   The foundations of statistics include concepts of prior                   
              beliefs and their characterization and their relation to good                  
              statistical procedures.  How standard statistical procedures                   
              behave under nonstandard conditions and how to test the                        
              conditions to verify assumptions are other basic issues to be                  
              considered in this project.
