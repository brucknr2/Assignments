Abstract    :
                   Profs. Manogue and Dray will investigate topics in                        
              mathematical physics connected with the behavior of waves in                   
              unusual geometries due to gravitational fields.  These studies                 
              may help to understand possible phenomena to be expected in a                  
              quantum theory of gravitation.                                                 
                   Among the topics to be investigated are the effects of                    
              change in topology and signature of the matric; field theory                   
              in rotating spacetimes; and the octonionic superstring.
