Abstract    :
              Airborne video has demonstrated promise as a rapid, low-cost                   
              means of acquiring imagery for a variety of ecological                         
              applications:  fish and wildlife habitat, plant communities,                   
              phytomass determination, crop damage, weed infestations.  Image                
              acquisition can be timed to coincide with an event of interest                 
              (e.g., a flood, an algae bloom) at a spatial scale suitable for                
              detecting objects as small as individual organisms (e.g., trees,               
              geese).  The benefits of airborne video could be greatly                       
              enhanced, however, by combining frame-grabbed video images into a              
              comprehensive geo-referenced database suitable for use in a                    
              Geographic Information System (GIS) where the information could                
              be integrated with other spatial databases (e.g., population                   
              density, land ownership) and manipulated using the multitude of                
              spatial analysis tools inherent to GISs.  Therefore, the goal of               
              this award is to develop a prototype airborne video database                   
              acquisition system capable of: 1) gathering all the information                
              needed to georeference a video image at the moment of                          
              acquisition, 2) displaying in real time the spatial extent and                 
              location of images acquired, and 3) selecting images for analysis              
              and mosaicing them into a comprehensive GIS coverage.
