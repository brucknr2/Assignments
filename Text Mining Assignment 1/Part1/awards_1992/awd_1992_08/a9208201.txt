Abstract    :
                   This grant supports the research of Judy Kennedy.  The goal               
              of the research is to investigate the role of exotic topological               
              sets in typical dynamical systems.  There is much evidence that                
              these sets occur frequently and unavoidable even in low                        
              dimensions.                                                                    
                   Chaos is a phenomenon that can occur in very simple                       
              dynamical systems that model many aspects of everyday life.  The               
              dependence of solution behavior on small changes in initial                    
              conditions and in parameters can profoundly influence expected                 
              outcomes.
