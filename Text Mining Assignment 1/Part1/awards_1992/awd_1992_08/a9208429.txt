Abstract    :
                 Automatic assembly sequence generation (ASG) is important for               
              efficient manufacturing and concurrent engineering.  There are                 
              two main difficulties with developing tools for ASG: (i) the                   
              combinatorics makes solutions by blind search intractable and                  
              (ii) criteria for optimal assembly sequences are difficult to                  
              formalize.                                                                     
                   Earlier work of the PI investigated the use of case-based                 
              reasoning techniques to simultaneously address both problems with              
              encouraging results especially concerning the extensibility to                 
              covering large sets of problems.  The practical objective of this              
              project is to verify these results on a larger prototype, and                  
              thus demonstrate the usefulness of case-based assembly sequence                
              generation for practical applications.  The theoretical                        
              objectives of this project are to investigate new methods for                  
              adaptive learning and case matching which will form part of the                
              new prototype.                                                                 
                   The result of this work is a fully implemented case-based                 
              reasoning system for a large class of assembly devices.  The                   
              conceptual results involved in building such a system should                   
              prove useful to research in intelligent design and manufacturing               
              systems and in case-based reasoning field.
