Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The comparative study of electoral systems has, for the most part,             
              been confined to aggregate national-level returns, for the simple              
              reason that these are the data that are available in machine-                  
              readable form.  This pilot study seeks to compile electoral results            
              at the district level for a range of democratic countries.  The                
              investigator will then code the results and make the resulting                 
              machine-readable datasets available to the scholarly community and             
              public.  The proposal also seeks to investigate the relationship               
              between electoral structure and the number of parties (an area long            
              dominated by what is called Duverger's Law) with a deliberate                  
              district level focus.  The pilot study should substantially enhance            
              our understanding of the topic.
