Abstract    :
              Partial funding for a microprocessor-controlled, variable-                     
              temperature, recording circular dichroism spectrometer is                      
              requested.  The instrument will be supervised on a daily                       
              basis by the Principal Investigator (Michael  Y. Ogawa) who                    
              will use it to determine the conformational behavior of                        
              synthetic polypepties derivatized for electron-transfer                        
              studies.  The instrument will also be used extensively by                      
              the co-Principal Investigator (N. B. Leontis) to monitor the                   
              conformational behavior of novel nucleic acid structures                       
              such as three-way DNA and RNA junctions and their                              
              interactions with intercalating ligands.  In addition, the                     
              instrument will be used by George Bullerjahn in the                            
              Department of Biological  Sciences at BGSU to monitor                          
              structural transitions in photosynthetic membranes.  Minor                     
              projects from other users  in the Department of  Chemistry                     
              at both BGSU and the University of Toledo are also                             
              described.  There is no comparable instrumentation available                   
              in Northwest Ohio.
