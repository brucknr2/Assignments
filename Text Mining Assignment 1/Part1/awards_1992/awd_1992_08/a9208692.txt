Abstract    :
                   This research is concerned with twin buildings and Kac-Moody              
              groups.  The main thrust of the work is towards a classification               
              of twin buildings of rank at least three, and the groups of                    
              Kac-Moody type which operate on them.  The principal investigator              
              will also study local-global properties of affine buildings and                
              the global structure of hyperbolic buildings.                                  
                   The research supported is in a crucial area where several                 
              parts of mathematics intersect.  This project endeavors to                     
              classify certain finite groups by using finite geometry and                    
              combinatorics.  The geometric connection to the theory of                      
              reductive algebraic groups and Kac-Moody groups is important for               
              the study of finite simple groups.
