Abstract    :
                   Various problems of asymptotic approximation will be                      
              studied.  A resolution of the St. Petersburg paradox will be                   
              proposed.  The resolution will be achieved through an                          
              understanding of the nature of the distribution of the cumulative              
              gain in a sequence of games and their lightly trimmed variants,                
              when a fixed number of the largest gains are withheld from the                 
              gambler.  Several associated general problems concerning domains               
              of partial attraction and infinitely divisible distributions and               
              their trimmed versions will also be studied.                                   
                   This research will attempt to find a resolution to the St.                
              Petersburg paradox, a problem which was first studied in the                   
              early eighteenth century.  The paradox involves determining an                 
              appropriate fair price for playing a game of chance.
