Abstract    :
                   The mean lifetimes of metastable, low energy multi-charged                
              ions are measured using trapping techniques.  The ions are                     
              obtained from a cyclotron source and the intensity of decay                    
              photons measured against ion storage times.  Spectroscopic                     
              measurements of forbidden as well as electric dipole allowed                   
              transitions will be carried out using the method of collinear                  
              laser-ion beam spectroscopy.  Hyperfine quenching will be studied              
              using different isotopes of the same element.  The data will be                
              compared with recent theoretical calculations using many-body                  
              perturbations theory and multi-configuration Dirac-Fock theory.
