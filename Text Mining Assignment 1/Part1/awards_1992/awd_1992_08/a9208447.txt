Abstract    :
                   Scripps will serve as a facility for the archiving and                    
              analysis of GPS global tracing data to support regional crustal                
              deformation projects.  To support operations of the Permanent GPS              
              Geodetic Array (PGGA) in southern California, scripps generates                
              precise orbital ephemerides and maintain a comprehensive archive               
              of global tracking data.  At present, orbits are at the several                
              parts in 108 level computed within several days of observation and             
              based on nearly automatic data processing.  These orbits land                  
              global tracing data have proven to be of great benefit to ongoing              
              crustal deformation projects.
