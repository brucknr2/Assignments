Abstract    :
                   This research is concerned with the representation theory of              
              finite groups and group cohomology.  The principal investigator                
              will work on Mackey functors; Alperin's conjecture; the                        
              development of computer software; group cohomology calculations;               
              stable summands of classifying spaces; and perfect isometries of               
              blocks and derived equivalences.                                               
                   The research supported concerns the representation theory of              
              finite groups.  A group is an algebraic object used to study                   
              transformations.  Because of this, groups are a fundamental tool               
              in physics, chemistry and computer science as well as                          
              mathematics.  Representation theory is an important method for                 
              determining the structure of groups.
