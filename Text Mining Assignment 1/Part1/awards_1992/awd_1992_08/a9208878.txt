Abstract    :
              Only 60 of the 3,000 species of the extant lizards attain an adult             
              body mass greater than 1 kg.  Yet, these large lizards represent               
              over 60% of the lizard species considered threatened or endangered.            
              We have previously examined incubation requirements, otogeny of                
              behavior, and adult reproductive biology of several large lizard               
              species in diverse genera (Varanus, Iguana, Ctenosaura).  Although             
              only distantly related, their large size and requirement for vast              
              tracts of undisturbed habitat link these species with respect to               
              management/conservation strategies.  We now propose to study                   
              Cyclura nubila, a species we consider to be a model that will                  
              provide substantial baseline data for comparative purposes within              
              the genus.  The study population of C. nubila can be manipulated               
              in ways that will yield data required for future management                    
              decisions.  The management techniques employed should be applicable            
              to other genera of large lizards.
