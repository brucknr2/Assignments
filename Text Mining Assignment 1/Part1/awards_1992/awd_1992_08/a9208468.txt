Abstract    :
                    This grant provides support for two University of                        
              Michigan scientists, Profs. F. Becchetti and J. Jnecke, and                   
              their students, to carry out experiments using NSF-funded                      
              accelerator facilities at Michigan State University, the                       
              University of Indiana, and Notre Dame University.  Their                       
              research will focus on unusual properties of atomic nuclei                     
              using short-lived radioactive nuclei as particle beams.                        
              Studies of unusual .- and -decay modes of nuclei will also be                 
              undertaken.  Many of these experiments bear upon the                           
              understanding of the creation of nuclei in supernova and                       
              stellar nuclear reaction processes.
