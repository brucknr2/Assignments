Abstract    :
              This award in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic                   
              Chemistry Program will support continued studies by Professor                  
              R. H. Holm of Harvard University in several areas of                           
              bioinorganic chemistry.  Areas to be investigated include 1)                   
              molybdenum oxotransferases including synthesis of analogues and                
              isotopic labeling studies of rabbit liver aldehyde oxidase; 2)                 
              synthesis of models for the cofactors of nitrogenase; 3)                       
              functional models of the nickel enzymes hydrogenase and CO                     
              dehydrogenase.  In all analogue studies emphasis is on                         
              synthetic models that provide functional mimics of the enzyme                  
              action.  In a less biologically related area investigations of                 
              the synthesis of molecular chalogenide clusters from soluble                   
              thiometallates and by excision of fragments from insoluble,                    
              nonmolecular solids will be undertaken.                                        
              %%%                                                                            
              The nature of many enzymes is such that precise molecular                      
              structures and mechanistic details cannot be determined by                     
              conventional physical techniques.  A variety of indirect                       
              methods have evolved that can be used to infer enzyme                          
              structures and to help define the individual chemical steps                    
              involved in their catalytic mechanisms.  The application and                   
              development of these indirect methods is the purpose of this                   
              research.
