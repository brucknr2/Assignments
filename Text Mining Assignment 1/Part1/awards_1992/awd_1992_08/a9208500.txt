Abstract    :
                   The PI will develop a tool for computations in geometric                  
              topology to be called TopDrawer.  This program allows one to                   
              input and manipulate geometric diagrams.  The project also                     
              involves several Mathematical packages which are incorporated                  
              into some calculations.                                                        
                   The motivation for this program is the investigation of                   
              surfaces in four dimensional space.
