Abstract    :
                   Agler will continue his development of a very general                     
              extension theory for operators on Hilbert spaces that would apply              
              to many classes of operators including subnormal operators,                    
              n-symmetric operators, and m-isometries.  This will require first              
              identifying the class of extensions that would go with a given                 
              operator, finding a good model theory for the extension, and                   
              finally applying the construction to prove new theorems.                       
              Progress on these problems will be of interest to many parts of                
              analysis.                                                                      
                   Operator theory is that part of mathematics that studies the              
              infinite dimensional generalizations of matrices.  In particular,              
              when restricted to finite dimensional subspaces, an operator has               
              the usual linear properties, and thus can be represented by a                  
              matrix.  The central problem in operator theory is to classify                 
              operators satisfying additional conditions given in terms of                   
              associated operators (e.g. the adjoint) or in terms of the                     
              underlying space.  Operator theory underlies much of mathematics,              
              and many of the applications of mathematics to other sciences.
