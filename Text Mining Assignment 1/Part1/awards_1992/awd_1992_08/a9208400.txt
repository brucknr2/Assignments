Abstract    :
              This project deals with electronic and magnetic properties of                  
              semiconductor heterostructures.  These materials are being studied             
              with far infrared (FIR) and visible spectroscopy.  The                         
              heterostructures are fabricated in-house.  The project has three               
              components.  First is FIR magnetospectroscopy of interfaces between            
              III-V semiconductors and II-VI based diluted magnetic                          
              semiconductors, in order to determine how the two-dimensional                  
              electron gas on the III-V side of the interface is affected by                 
              proximity to magnetic electron wave functions from a DMS material.             
              Second, the fundamental electronic and magentic properties of                  
              digital alloys (ultra-short-period superlattices grown monolayer-              
              by-monolayer) are being studied by spectroscopy.  Finally, the                 
              program concentrates on optical studies of DMS materials in which              
              band tuning can be achieved by Zeeman adjustment of the band                   
              alignment at interfaces.
