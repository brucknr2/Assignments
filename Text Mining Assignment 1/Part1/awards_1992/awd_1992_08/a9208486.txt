Abstract    :
              Visualization-based visual languages, a new class of visual languages          
              are based upon visual models derived from common and useful program            
              visualizations.  In this project, visualization models which may also          
              be useful as programming models shall be collected in a number of              
              problem domains.  A visual language for the specification of                   
              communications protocols based on message-flow diagrams will be                
              implemented.
