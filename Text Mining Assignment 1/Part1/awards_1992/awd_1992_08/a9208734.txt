Abstract    :
                   The effects of ungulate grazing on Schizachyrium scoparium                
              (little bluestem grass) will be investigated at several levels.                
              The effects of herbivory on plant morphology, fitness and animal               
              preference will be used to predict the effects of herbivory on S.              
              scoparium population structure and regulation and on the                       
              distribution of S. scoparium across the landscape.  These                      
              predications will be tested by further field experiments and by                
              surveying existing populations of S. scoparium across the                      
              landscape taking advantage of )and verifying) existing spatial                 
              variation in grazing intensity at several scales.  This study                  
              will help fill important gaps in our knowledge of plant/animal                 
              interactions: the effects of herbivores on plant fitness and                   
              plant populations and how processes at these levels determine                  
              landscape patterns of important rangeland forage grass.
