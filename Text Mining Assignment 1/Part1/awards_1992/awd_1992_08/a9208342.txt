Abstract    :
              Mudge         This project supports a rapid prototyping facility that  allows
              researchers in computer architecture to prototype their  designs and obtain
              accurate performance measurements.  The  equipment in the facility are
              available nationally over the  Internet, and staff are employed by the facility
              to assist remote  users in prototyping their designs and in connecting custom 
              hardware to the facility's equipment.  The major component of the  facility is
              a Quickturn Enterprise System that can prototype  logic netlists of a target
              system in a network of FPGA's.  It can  emulate the target with a slowdown of
              only a few hundredfold,  which is fast enough to exercise the design with
              significant  benchmarks, test functionality, and take performance 
              measurements.  A built-in logic analyzer and stimulus generator  permit
              detailed performance measurement and functional testing.
