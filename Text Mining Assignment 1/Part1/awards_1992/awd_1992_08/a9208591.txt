Abstract    :
              This grant is to fund a research project to develop                            
              multicolor thin film electroluminescent devices.                               
              The key to achieving high brightness and efficiency                            
              is the use of a new class of luminescent                                       
              organometallic lanthanide complexes as emitter                                 
              materials.  Band widths as narrow as 10 nm csan be                             
              achieved using Tb+3 and Eu+3 complexes.                                        
              Efficient injection type thin film electroluminescent                          
              devices require electron and hole injecting materials                          
              with low and high work functions respectively.  By                             
              using organic hole conductors and alkali metal                                 
              alloys as electron injectors, it will be possible to                           
              develop electroluminescent devices of high rightness                           
              and contrast for multicolor flat plate displays.
