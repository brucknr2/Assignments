Abstract    :
                   This award provides funds to support the participation of                 
              research scientists and graduate students in a workshop on                     
              numerical long-range (10-30 days) weather prediction.  The workshop            
              represents a follow-on to a very successful one which was held                 
              three years ago.  The workshop participants will examine ongoing               
              issues of model behavior and systematic errors, the scale and                  
              frequency of interactions, the importance of boundary conditions.              
              They will also consider recent results on the structure and                    
              dynamics of long-lived weather phenomena and associated wether                 
              regime transitions.  The organizers hope to identify the most                  
              pressing of the outstanding problem areas in long-range weather                
              forecasting.                                                                   
                   This award is jointly supported by NOAA and NSF.
