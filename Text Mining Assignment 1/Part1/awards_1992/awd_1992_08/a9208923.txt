Abstract    :
              The Polar Research Board (earlier called the Committee on Polar                
              Research) was established in 1958 by the National Academy of                   
              Sciences, in response to the need for scientific advice on the                 
              increases in U.S. and international activities relating to the                 
              polar regions.  The Board is a multidisciplinary body with                     
              representation from four broad areas: the social, biological and               
              physical sciences as well as engineering.  Members are drawn                   
              from academic institutions, national laboratories and industry.                
                                                                                             
              The activities of the Polar Research Board are funded by a wide                
              range of government agencies, including the Department of                      
              Energy, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, the                 
              National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the Office of                 
              Naval Research, the United States Coast Guard, the U.S.                        
              Geological Survey, as well as the National Science Foundation                  
              (NSF).  This grant provides the NSF portion of support to the                  
              Board.                                                                         
                                                                                             
              Activities of the Board during the grant period include                        
              development of a national polar research plan, providing federal               
              agencies with advice on the role of arctic and antarctic                       
              research in studies of global change, examination of current                   
              issues in glaciology, representing the United States on the                    
              Scientific Committee on Antarctic Research, ensuring active U.S.               
              scientific participation in the International Arctic Science                   
              Committee activities, as well as completing a series of studies                
              relating to more detailed problems of polar research.
