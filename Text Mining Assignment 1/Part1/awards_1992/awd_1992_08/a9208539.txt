Abstract    :
              This project on large-scale optimization has two main                          
              objectives:  to gain better theoretical understanding of the                   
              effectiveness of sequential and parallel, and deterministic                    
              and randomized structure-exploiting methods, and to conduct                    
              large-scale experimentation leading to fast and numerically-                   
              robust implementations for solving various types of block-                     
              structured problems.  A wide class of methods for general                      
              block-structured linear and convex optimization problems will                  
              be studied.  The development of these methods draws upon ideas                 
              of potential-function reduction, block-coordinate descent,                     
              adaptations of scaling techniques of interior-point methods,                   
              and hybrid approaches.  Theoretical emphasis will be on the                    
              complexity analysis of structure-exploiting procedures.                        
              Practical emphasis will be on the approximate solution of                      
              large-scale problems with various blocks, including special                    
              types of blocks amenable to efficient combinatorial                            
              algorithms.
