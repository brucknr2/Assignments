Abstract    :
              This award funds a research planning workshop on geometric                     
              uncertainty in motion planning, to be held June 15-17, 1992 at                 
              the USC Marine Science Center on Catalina Island in California.                
              The organizers are Profs. Ken Goldberg and Ari Requicha of the                 
              University of Southern California and Matt Mason of Carnegie-                  
              Mellon University.  Robotic operations in most practical settings              
              must cope with uncertainties arising from sensor noise, control                
              error, mechanical tolerances, and incomplete or inaccurate models              
              of the environment.  Effective motion-planning methods are                     
              critical to successful robotic implementations.  Researchers from              
              academia, government, and industry laboratories will come                      
              together to review past work, work-in-progress, and limitations                
              and alternatives to existing theory that suggest priorities for                
              future research.//
