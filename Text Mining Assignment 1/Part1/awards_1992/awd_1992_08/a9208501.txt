Abstract    :
                   This grant supports the research of Professor J. Hsia to work             
              on problems in number theory.  Professor Hsia will continue to work            
              on the arithmetic of integral quadratic forms.  In particular, he              
              will work on the representation theory of positive definite                    
              quadratic forms.  He also intends to continue his study of an                  
              Iwasawa type theory for spinor genera.                                         
                   This is research in the field of number theory.   Number                  
              theory starts with the whole numbers and questions such as the                 
              divisibility of one whole number by another.  It is among the                  
              oldest fields of mathematics and it was originally pursued for                 
              purely aesthetic reasons.  However, within the last half century,              
              it has become an essential tool in developing new algorithms for               
              computer science and new error correcting codes for electronics.
