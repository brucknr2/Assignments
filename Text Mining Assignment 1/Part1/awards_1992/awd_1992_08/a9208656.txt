Abstract    :
                   This research project has three parts; the first is to                    
              develop a general class of models and inferential techniques for               
              shape analysis.  The second aspect is the development of a theory              
              for the case when the least-squares estimate of mean shape can be              
              written as the principal eigenvector of a certain matrix.  Then                
              highly interactive software can be written for visualization of                
              shape spaces and shape differences.                                            
                   The shape of a physical object is defined as whatever                     
              remains after the position of the object, its size and its                     
              orientation are accounted for.  In many fields including                       
              medicine, biology, imaging, computer vision, industrial                        
              engineering, psychology, much of the data is spatial and is often              
              in the form of images.  This research will develop statistical                 
              and high-performance graphical methods for analyzing and                       
              visualizing shapes when these are of principal interest.
