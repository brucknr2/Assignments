Abstract    :
              This award is made in the Special Projects Office of the                       
              Chemistry Division under the Materials Synthesis and Processing                
              Initiative. Surfactant bilayers supported on colloidal                         
              particles will be developed as a new medium for photochemical                  
              energy conversion. Vectorial energy and electron transfer                      
              reactions within the bilayer will be initiated by aromatic                     
              hydrocarbons promoted to their triplet state either by direct                  
              photoexcitation or by sensitization with Ru(II)polypyridine                    
              complexes.  The inorganic supports will be based on silica                     
              and/or alumina.  These supports will be activated for                          
              participation in the bilayer-mediated photoevents by the                       
              incorporation of photosensitizers or redox-active metal ions                   
              into the inorganic oxide matrix.  Laser flash photolysis will                  
              be used to determine relevant spectral, kinetic, and                           
              thermodynamic parameters for the desired chain of events                       
              resulting in either triplet energy migration or charge                         
              separation across the supported bilayer membranes.

              This project is expected to contribute to a fundamental                        
              understanding of membrane-mediated energy conversion processes,                
              and ultimately to the design of molecular devices that capture                 
              light and store it by chemical means as fuel.
