Abstract    :
              This is a renewal project to investigate the compuational                      
              complexity of number-theoretic problems.  Besides providing a                  
              number of unsolved problems in complexity theory, number                       
              theory is useful in the design of systems for random number                    
              generation, cryptography, and computer algebra.  The                           
              investigations fall into three categories:                                     
                                                                                             
              a) Exploration of the algorithmic consequences of heuristic                    
                 assumptions such as the Extended Riemann Hypothesis.                        
                                                                                             
              b) Analysis and design of number-theoretic algorithms, with                    
                 special attention being paid to efficient randomized                        
                 algorithms for primality, factorization of polynomials,                     
                 etc.                                                                        
                                                                                             
              c) Applications of algebraic geometry (especially the theory                   
                 of varieties over finite fields) to constructives                           
                 techniques.
