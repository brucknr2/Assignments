Abstract    :
              This is a project to upgrade the Nuclear Magnetic Resonance                    
              Facility existing within the Chemistry Department of                           
              Pennsylvania State University.  The upgrade includes an                        
              improved detection/frequency generation system for the 11.7                    
              T spectrometer, the installation of a third channel for                        
              triple-resonance three-dimensional data set collection, and                    
              the replacement of the obsolete MicroVAX II computer by                        
              Silicon Graphics workstations.  The upgraded instrumentation                   
              will be used to study, for example, the factors underlying                     
              catalysis and substrate binding in DNA polymerase I, T4                        
              polymerase complex, dihydrofolate reductase and                                
              trifunctional enzymes in the de novo pathway for purine                        
              biosynthesis; stability and folding patterns of apo b heme                     
              proteins; determination of structural features of proteins                     
              in solution; and the mechanism by which the primary                            
              structure of a protein directs the rapid and efficient                         
              folding to the native conformation.
