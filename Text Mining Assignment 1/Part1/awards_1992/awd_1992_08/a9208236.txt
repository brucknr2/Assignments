Abstract    :
                    This grant, made under the RUI program, supports the                     
              search of a Trinity College faculty member for evidence of the                 
              existence of a heavy, volatile .-emitter, eka-radon.  Such a                   
              substance would be a super-heavy element and would be the                      
              heaviest naturally occuring element to be discovered.
