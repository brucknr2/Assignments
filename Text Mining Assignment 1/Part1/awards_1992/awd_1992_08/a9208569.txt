Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This proposal applies the multi-dimensional reinforcement and                  
              near-net-shape manufacturing offered by 3-D fabric composites to               
              the textile processing of ceramic matrix composites (CMC).  The                
              processing methodology has been successful in the field of polymer             
              matrix composites.  Sol-Gel process will be used to produce ceramic            
              materials and CMC.  This methodology, if proved to be successful in            
              the field of CMC, can help to make CMC less limited by damage                  
              tolerance and composite machining and joining problems.

              This program applies the methodology which has been successful in              
              the textile processing of polymer matrix composites to the textile             
              processing of ceramic matrix composites (CMC).  Sol-Gel process                
              will be used to produce the ceramic materials.  This type of                   
              textile processing open up new opportunities in manufacture and                
              tailoring of CMC according to microstructures and properties.
