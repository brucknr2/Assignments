Abstract    :
              A key to understanding the molecular basis for bacterial                       
              pathogenicity in plants is the production and deployment of plant              
              defense elicitors and host range determinants.  We have previously             
              shown that the hrp/hrm gene cluster isolated from Pseudomonas                  
              syringae pv. syringae 61 enables nonpathogenic bacteria to elicit              
              plant defenses.  The hrp/hrm gene cluster, therefore, appears to               
              constitute a minimum genetic unit sufficient to produce plant                  
              defense elicitors.  Fourteen apparent transnational units have been            
              identified within the cluster that are organized as nine apparent              
              transcriptional units.  Several hrp genes act as positive                      
              regulatory elements.  The overall goal of this project is to                   
              elucidate the role of specific hrp/hrm genes in determining the                
              pathogenicity and host range of P. syringae strains.  Our approach             
              will be to:  1)  obtain the nucleotide sequence for remaining                  
              portions of the cluster to facilitate later manipulation,                      
              comparative analyses with other bacteria and deduction of gene                 
              function; 2) characterize the regulatory cascade controlling                   
              expression of hrp genes so that the genes directly contributing to             
              the production of plant defense elicitors can be identified and                
              manipulated; and 3) perform gene replacement experiments to test               
              the role of specific hrp genes in determining pathogenicity and                
              host range.                                                                    
              %%%                                                                            
              The study of these genes should lead to techniques useful in                   
              stopping the damage to plants susceptible to bacterial infection.
