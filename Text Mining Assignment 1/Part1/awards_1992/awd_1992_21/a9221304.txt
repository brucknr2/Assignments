Abstract    :
                   This award is for travel grants for United States                         
              participants to attend the 49th Session of the International                   
              Statistical Institute (ISI) in Florence, Italy, from August 25 to              
              September 3, 1993.  The funds, which will be administered by the               
              American Statistical Association (ASA), will provide partial                   
              support for transportation costs for individuals selected from                 
              institutions and non-profit associations.  A priority of the ASA               
              is to provide opportunities for junior researchers who have no                 
              other funding opportunities, to attend and participate in this                 
              important meeting.                                                             
                   The sections of the ISI include  (1) the Bernoulli Society                
              for Mathematical Statistics and Probability, with specific groups              
              or committees in stochastic processes, statistics in the physical              
              and engineering societies, European statisticians, and Latin                   
              American statisticians;  (2) the International Associations for                
              Survey Statisticians which holds seminars, work-shops, and                     
              tutorials preceding the ISI meeting;  (3) the International                    
              Association for Statistical Computing;  (4) the International                  
              Association for Official Statistics; and  (5) the International                
              Association for Statistical Education.  Also meeting in                        
              conjunction with ISI are specific groups with interests in                     
              international training centers, problems of industrial                         
              statisticians, and other special interest groups.                              
                   The convergence of this broad spectrum of statisticians,                  
              with participants from many countries, provides an excellent                   
              forum to present and discuss research results and educational                  
              activities in statistics.
