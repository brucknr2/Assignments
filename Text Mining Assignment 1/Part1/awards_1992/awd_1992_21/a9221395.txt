Abstract    :
              This award will continue the analysis of Very Low Frequency (VLF)              
              radio wave data acquired from Siple Station, Antarctica and the                
              magnetically conjugate station in Quebec between 1973 and 1989.                
              Over this period the U.S. Antarctic Program operated a VLF                     
              transmitter at Siple which has produced a very large and unique                
              data set which has already provided new insight into the structure             
              of the Earth's magnetosphere.  The investigators at Stanford                   
              University will continue to analyze and theoretically interpret the            
              experimental results.  In addition, they will digitize selected                
              analogue tapes and archive them for future research.
