Abstract    :
                   Understanding the functioning of terrestrial food webs                    
              requires quantitative knowledge of the diversity of prey consumed              
              by spiders, because spiders are major predators in these systems.              
              This project will develop a biochemical technique to analyze                   
              rapidly and accurately the diets of wandering spiders.  Once the               
              technique is perfected, its feasibility as a tool in field research            
              will be tested by analyzing the feeding relationships in a                     
              population of a model generalist predator, the wolf spider                     
              Schizocosa oreata.  This research uses polyacrylamide-gel                      
              electrophoresis (PAGE) to detect prey proteins in the guts of                  
              spiders.                                                                       
              %%%                                                                            
              Prudent management & conservation of natural communities depends on            
              fundamental understanding of how food webs function.  Forest -                 
              floor communities are particularly important because they often                
              control rate - limiting processes for forest productivity & growth.            
                                                                                             
              The results of this project will allow quantitative analysis of                
              predatory dynamic's in forest floor communities.
