              P  rk  ;  W X P#   9221879 Persechini  Dr. Persechini proposes to investigate
              the regulation of neural nitric oxide synthase (n-NOS).  Nitric oxide (NO) is a
              recently discovered messenger molecule associated with a variety of functions
              throughout the body.  In the brain and peripheral nervous system, NO has been
              implicated in neurotoxicity associated with stroke and neurodegenerative
              diseases and it may be the retrograde messenger responsible for long-term
              potentiation, a process thought to be associated with memory and learning.  NO
              has also been implicated in cerebellar long-term depression, which is thought
              to be associated with motor learning.  NO is responsible for endothelial
              derived relaxing factor (EDRF) activity regulating blood pressure and in
              macrophages         Y       it mediates tumoricidal and bactericidal actions. 
              n-NOS requires Ca   2+   -calmodulin for activity.  Dr. Persechini's interest
              is to define structure-function relationships in n-NOS relevant to its
              calmodulin-dependent regulation by correlating structural alterations in n-NOS
              with measurement of binding and activation of n-NOS by calmodulin.  These
              investigations will be facilitated by utilizing information contained in the
              amino acid sequences of two homologous amino acid positions that differ between
              n-NOS and mac-NOS but are contained within the calmodulin-binding domain in
              n-NOS.  Proposed studies are part of an ongoing investigation of the role
              played by calmodulin in cellular regulation.  Calmodulin regulates the activity
              of several enzymes including at least four protein kinases, one protein
              phosphatase,  and nitric oxide synthase, that are at the top of regulatory
              cascades.  Dr. Persechini has two broad long-term objectives in this
              laboratory.  The first is to contribute to the development of a comparative
              understanding of calmodulin-dependent enzyme activation.  Given the large and
              growing number of calmodulin targets, such an understanding is clearly
              important.  His second long-term objective is to contribute to an in-depth
              understanding of one of two specific calmodulin-dependent enzymes.  It is
              primarily the second of these goals that is addressed here. ***
