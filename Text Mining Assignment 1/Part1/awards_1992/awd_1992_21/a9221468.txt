Abstract    :
              This project continues and improves upon the University of                     
              California at Santa Barbara's previous successful measurements of              
              the Cosmic Microwave Background Radiation (CMBR) anisotropy from               
              South Pole, Antarctica.  The CMBR is relict radiation left over                
              from just a few hundred thousand years after the creation of the               
              universe.  Any anisotropies in the CMBR reveal the structure of the            
              early universe.  Because relict the radiation now reaching the                 
              Earth is in a wavelength range which is absorbed water vapor, it is            
              necessary to make these measurements from places where the                     
              atmosphere is extremely cold (and therefore dry), like South Pole,             
              or from above the atmosphere.                                                  
                                                                                             
              The University of California Santa Barbara group is part of the                
              Center for Particle Astrophysics and is extremely well qualified               
              and equipped to carry out this research.  The award also includes              
              funds for the support of undergraduate students to participate in              
              the research.
