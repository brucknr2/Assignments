Abstract    :
                   This project is designed to provide high-speed data                       
              communications and access to the NSFNET to the Veteran's                       
              Administration Medical Center and the LDS Hospital which are                   
              affiliated with the University of Utah School of Medicine.  The                
              connections to the two hospitals will be made via a 23 GHz                     
              microwave system.  The hub of the microwave network will be at the             
              University of Utah Health Sciences Center.  High-speed data                    
              communication services will significantly enhance the education and            
              research activities of faculty and students from the University of             
              Utah that work at these affiliated hospitals.                                  
                   To provide high speed access (10 megavits per second) to the              
              NSFNET for researchers, clinical instructors and students at                   
              affiliated teaching hospitals in order to:                                     
                                                                                             
                   1. Provide access to resources and services on the NSFNET for             
              faculty, staff and students at affiliated teaching hospitals.                  
                   2. Extend access to integrated library system (ILS) services,             
              provide interinstitutional file and document delivery service.                 
                   3. Distribute digitized images to medical student computer                
              assisted instruction workstations located in the affiliated                    
              teaching hospitals.                                                            
                   4. Transmit digital modalities (CT, MRI and Digitized                     
              Radiographs) to support education of medical students and
