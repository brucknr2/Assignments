Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              El Nino (ENSO) events occur periodically and vary greatly in both              
              intensity and spatial magnitude.  ENSOs are characterized by local             
              increases in water temperature, sea level elevation and reduce                 
              water column nutrients.  Despite these biologically significant                
              features, and especially considering their influence on pelagic                
              assemblages and coral reef ecosystems, the impact of ENSOs on mid-             
              to high-latitude, nearshore benthic assemblages remains ambiguous.             
              The rocky intertidal assemblage characteristic of the exposed coast            
              of Washington State has been experiencing ENSO conditions since at             
              least January 1992.  Dr. Paine will examine how changes in                     
              nutrients availability effect algal productivity, recruitment and              
              growth.  A relative new technique will be employed using terra                 
              cotta flower pots.  In a balanced, replicated design, some pots                
              will be filled with nutrient-rich materials, some protected from               
              benthic grazers by anti-fouling paint and others left untreated.               
              Comparison between treatments should allow a statistical analysis              
              of the influences of terrestrial inputs, nutrients and grazers on              
              algal productivity.  Repetition in a non-ENSO year will identify               
              the possible contribution of water column recruitment of three kelp            
              species.
