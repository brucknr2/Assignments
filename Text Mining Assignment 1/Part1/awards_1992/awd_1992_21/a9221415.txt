Abstract    :
                   The plan for connectivity is clear and comprehensive and                  
              illustrates a well-rounded use of networking.  Some 15 areas are               
              identified as potential beneficiaries.  The likely impact seems                
              very positive.  The technical portion is sound and the local                   
              infrastructure is in place.  The PI demonstrates considerable                  
              expertise.  Future support seems assured.  Recommend funding for               
              one year at $30,000.
