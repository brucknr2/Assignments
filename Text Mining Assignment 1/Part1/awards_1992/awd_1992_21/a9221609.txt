Abstract    :
                This research is a collaboration between investigators at                    
              Washington University, Saint Louis, Missouri, and North Carolina               
              State University, Raleigh, North Carolina.  The funding will                   
              support a passive seismic experiment utilizing the PASSCAL portable            
              seismic equipment, managed by the IRIS university consortium, in               
              the Tonga, Fiji, and Vanuatu regions.  Earthquakes occurring                   
              throughout the world will be recorded to study the structure of                
              subducting slabs using phases converted at the upper slab                      
              interface, dispersion of phases traveling up the slab, and                     
              comparison of travel times between phases traveling inside and                 
              outside of the slab.  The structure of the back arc basin will be              
              studied utilizing regional earthquakes and SKS splitting from                  
              teleseisms.  This study will improve information about the source              
              processes of deep earthquakes in the most active deep seismic zone             
              in the world, as well as provide better constraints on the                     
              tectonics of the deep slab, shallow trench and back-arc basin                  
              regions.
