Abstract    :
              Bowie/Pickering  9221383    This project will investigate the twentieth century
              incorporation of Lakota households into wage labor and consumer markets. 
              Despite the tremendous body of research about Native American communities, and
              about the Lakota of South Dakota in particular, the participation of American
              Indians as wage laborers in the U.S. economy remains hidden.  Similarly, the
              choices made by Lakota households among options of wage labor, informal
              economic activities and urban migration to meet their needs have not been
              explored.  The thesis of this project is that incorporation into capitalism is
              a culturally constituted process, both influenced by and influencing the
              trajectory of the world economic system.    Extensive qualitative interviews
              will be conducted with Lakota people from the Pine Ridge and Rosebud Indian
              Reservations.  Interview participants will be selected to reflect three
              communities on each reservation and from four urban areas where Lakota people
              migrate for wage work.  Archival resources and U.S. Census data will be
              combined with interview information to examine the process of economic
              incorporation and household decision-making from 1900 to the present.  This
              research will contribute to the theory of economic incorporation as a
              culturally mediated process, and of capitalism as a dynamic social system.  ***
