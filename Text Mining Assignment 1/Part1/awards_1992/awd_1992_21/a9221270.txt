Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This award will support a collaborative                                        
              research project between Dr. Gerald P. Hammond,                                
              of the University of Massachusetts, Dartmouth                                  
              and Dr. Abraham J. Vaisberg, of the Institute                                  
              of Tropical Medicine Alexander von Humboldt,                                   
              Universidad Peruana Cayetano Heredia, Peru.                                    
              The research involves the isolation and                                        
              structure elucidation of bioactive compounds                                   
              from Peruvian wound-healing plants.  Plants                                    
              extracts will be bioassayed for wound healing                                  
              activity and screened for other pharmacological                                
              effects.  Samples will be assayed for cell                                     
              migration and cell proliferation, and will be                                  
              fractioned until pure bioactive compounds are                                  
              obtained.  The bioactive compounds thus                                        
              obtained will be evaluated for their biological                                
              properties.                                                                    
                                                                                             
              This collaborative research fulfills the                                       
              program objective of advancing scientific                                      
              knowledge by combining the complementary                                       
              expertise of researchers from both countries in                                
              an area of strong mutual interest.  Proving the                                
              medicinal or scientific value of these plants                                  
              will contribute to the preservation of folk                                    
              medicine practices and to the conservation of                                  
              biological diversity.
