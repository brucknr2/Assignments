Abstract    :
                   Geisinger's wide-area-network (GEN), linking the three main               
              Geisinger campuses, will be complete in the fall of 1992.  While               
              the primary function of GEN is to support clinical activity, i.e.,             
              appointment, schedules, billing, purchasing, etc., with an INTERNET            
              connection, GEN's functionality can expand to encompass Geisinger's            
              research and education missions as well.  Given access to the many             
              resources available through an INTERNET connection, Geisinger                  
              research scientists, clinicians, and educators can work as though              
              they are at one of the major medical academic  centers in                      
              Philadelphia or Pittsburgh instead of in scenic, but isolated,                 
              rural noncentral or northeastern Pennsylvania.  With and INTERNET              
              connection at Geisinger, pharmacists will be able to exchange                  
              protocols for new drugs, scientists can query their colleagues at              
              other institutions for protein purification techniques, authors can            
              submit and revise manuscripts electronically, physicians                       
              participating in clinical trials or protocols can log patient-care             
              information, receive updates, and share concerns without leaving               
              their offices, students can stay in touch with their home                      
              universities, and librarians can transmit and receive documents and            
              other information required by all of those listed above with                   
              greater efficiency and speed.
