Abstract    :
              This award is the starter grant increment of Dr. Colon's                       
              Postdoctoral Fellowship in Chemistry. The research will result                 
              in a better understanding of the reorganizational energy of                    
              molecules as a function of distance in long range electron                     
              transfer reactions.  Electron transfer rates will be measured                  
              for Re(II) and Re(I) coordinated to human myoglobin variants.                  
              The effects of distance of electron transfer and of the                        
              electronic coupling in the protein on electron transfer rates                  
              will be evaluated. Flash-quench and photoinduced electron                      
              transfer experiments will be used to obtain the desired rates.

              Biological electron transfer plays major roles in respiration,                 
              photosynthesis, and immune response. The research to be carried                
              out will provide a better insight into these important                         
              reactions. These insights will be helpful to scientists                        
              studying many aspcects of human health.
