Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The central theme of the research program is to study how                      
              the nuclear activity present in luminous quasi-stellar                         
              objects (QSO)and powerful radio galaxies is related to their                   
              environments and what physical mechanisms are the cause of                     
              these phenomena.  The studies will include an intensive                        
              study of the inner structure of QSO host galaxies at low                       
              redshifts, an imaging and spectroscopic investigation of a                     
              complete sample of radio galaxies, and a program to                            
              determine morphological properties of rich clusters                            
              associated with QSOs by identifying specific galaxies at QSO                   
              redshift to faint limiting magnitude.                                          
                                                                                             
              The Principal Investigator is regarded as a world leader in                    
              this research area.
