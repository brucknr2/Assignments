Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The retina of the eye is a sheet of tissue containing the                      
              photoreceptor cells.  Within these cells is a biochemical                      
              photopigment that is sensitive to light.   The light-sensitive                 
              component belongs to a class of vitamin-A related structures called            
              retinoid.  Retinoid is synthesized elsewhere in the body,                      
              transported in the blood to the eye, and taken up and stored in the            
              retina.  The biochemical binding mechanisms for these transfers are            
              important to understand in order to clarify metabolism and                     
              photoreception in the retina.  This project uses the system of a               
              highly visual invertebrate species, the octopus, to begin                      
              biochemical and molecular biological studies on the localization of            
              binding sites and sites of synthesis of proteins and compounds                 
              important to the function of the intracellular matrix in the                   
              retina.  These studies will provide novel data to compare with work            
              on the vertebrate retina that should give new insights into                    
              photoreceptor function.  The Research in Undergraduate Institutions            
              (RUI) component here also allows exploitation of this simple                   
              invertebrate system for giving valuable research opportunities to              
              undergraduates, particularly for the minority students enrolled                
              here.
