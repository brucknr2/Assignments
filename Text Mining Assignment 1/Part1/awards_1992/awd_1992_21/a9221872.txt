Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                                         ABSTRACT                                            
                                                                                             
                                                                                            
              A conference on Asia-Mainland/Austronesian Connections is planned              
              to capitalize on the aggregation of historical/comparative                     
              linguists, archaeologists, and physical anthropologists who will               
              be in residence at the University of Hawaii during 1992-93, and                
              the increasing attention of recent years to the question of the                
              origins of the ancestors of the Austronesian speaking people. The              
              conference will augment the group already in Hawaii with others                
              whose work relates to the possibility of an Asia-Mainland origin               
              and who have established themselves as among the chief                         
              proponents, or the chief critics, of one or another of the major               
              extant hypotheses as to those origins. Evidence for the various                
              hypotheses will be presented and debated during the four-day                   
              conference. The proceedings will be published in a single issue                
              of Oceanic Linguistics: Special Publications.
