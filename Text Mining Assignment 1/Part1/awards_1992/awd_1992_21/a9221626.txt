Abstract    :
              The U. S. Bureau of the Census will provide SRS a report on the                
              stock and employment of scientists and engineers in three                      
              countries;  India, Australia and Hungary.  The Bureau of the Census            
              will derive the numbers from the population census of each country;            
              India, 1981 and 1991; Australia, 1986; and Hungary, 1990.  Work                
              with the statistical offices of each country will be done to obtain            
              special census tabulations when needed.  The report will provide               
              the number of S&E per 1000 of he laborforce, and their                         
              characteristics; age, sex, education and employment by industry                
              group.  This information will be used in Science and Engineering               
              Indicators and in Science and Technology International Update, for             
              cross country comparisons of skilled laborforce.
