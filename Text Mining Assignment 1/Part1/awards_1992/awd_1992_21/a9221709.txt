Abstract    :
                   This award is for partial support of a workshop on                        
              physics and experiments with linear e+e- colliders.  It is                     
              sponsored in part by KEK and SLAC, two of the most active                      
              laboratories involved in R&D on linear colliders.                              
              Participation is international in scope.  It's the second in a                 
              series on the subject, following on the September 1991                         
              workshop that took place in Finland.
