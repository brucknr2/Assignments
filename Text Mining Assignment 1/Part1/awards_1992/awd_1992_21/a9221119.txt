Abstract    :
              The proposed research involves the catalytic mechanism of bovine               
              liver glutamate dehydrogenase.  The timing of bond-making and bond-            
              breaking processes as well as proton transfers will be determined              
              for both the forward and reverse reactions catalyzed by the enzyme.            
              The catalytic reaction coordinate will be correlated with enzyme               
              conformation changes which are known to alter solvent access to the            
              active site.  Mechanistic results will be correlated with available            
              protein three dimensional structural information to arrive at a                
              unified description of the catalytic process as a function of time.            
              %%%                                                                            
              Enzyme mechanism studies characterize the step by step processes               
              involving the enzyme, solvent, and substrate(s) which occur during             
              catalysis.  Developing a self-consistent picture of an enzyme                  
              mechanism is difficult and laborious, requiring application of                 
              structural, chemical, as well as kinetic information.  It is the               
              most difficult and potentially most rewarding study that can be                
              undertaken with enzymes, which are in their very essence active and            
              time-dependent entities.  Knowledge of mechanism allows                        
              manipulation of the enzyme's catalytic machinery to carry out                  
              chemistry and permits design of inhibitors of the enzyme which                 
              often turn out to be potent drugs.
