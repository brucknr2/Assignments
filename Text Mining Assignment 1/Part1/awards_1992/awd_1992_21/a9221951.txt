Abstract    :
                   Many meteorological phenomenon are controlled and/or                      
              influenced by the physics of the convective boundary layer.  During            
              the Convection and Precipitation/Electrification Experiment (CaPE)             
              held in Florida in 1991, a collection of very advanced                         
              meteorological instrumentation was brought to bear on a variety of             
              meteorological problems including those of the boundary layer.                 
                   Using data from the CaPE, the Principal Investigator will                 
              conduct research with the following five objectives: study of a                
              waterspout with Doppler radar and cloud photogrammetry; detailed               
              analysis of the sea breeze phenomena with emphasis on synoptic flow            
              regime, along front variation and convective initiation; evolution             
              of horizontal convective rolls that develop within the boundary                
              layer with emphasis on along roll variation of enhanced cloud                  
              development; analysis of convective initiation resulting from the              
              collision of two boundaries; analysis of air mass storms in order              
              toe assess the generality of a generalized thunderstorm conceptual             
              model recently proposed by the Principal Investigator.
