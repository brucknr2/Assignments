Abstract    :
              This project is investigating possible structures for a                        
              National Power Systems Research Institute that will                            
              involve universities in the problems of power                                  
              system infrastructure, especially manpower.  The                               
              goal of the project is to develop a structure that will                        
              allow  the institute to have a key leadership role in                          
              addressing some of the institutional and                                       
              technological problems associated with power                                   
              system infrastructure in the US.  It is investigating                          
              a research focus, an educational focus, and                                    
              administrative makeup, criteria for determining its                            
              location, and criteria for outreach to other                                   
              universities and other segments of the industry.
