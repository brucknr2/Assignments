Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  Rodlike polymers are the basic components of various high --              
              temperature, high -- strength materials.  Conventional processing              
              methods are often inadequate for rods, so they must be processed               
              from concentrated solutions -- most often into fibers and films.               
              However, the solution behavior or rodlike polymers remains poorly              
              studied compared to random coil polymers.  Additionally, it is                 
              important to understand the dynamics of mixtures of rodlike and                
              random coil polymers, as these mixtures are the precursors to                  
              composite materials in which rodlike polymers reinforce a                      
              conventional random coil matrix.  Optical studies of the diffusion             
              of helical polypeptides have already revealed much about                       
              concentrated, isotropic solutions.  These studies will be extended             
              to  mixtures with random coils and also to liquid crystalline                  
              solutions.  A special class of polypeptide, the                                
              poly(alkylglutamate)s, will facilitate these studies.                          
                                                                                             
              Thermoreversible gelation of rodlike polymers is a baffling                    
              phenomenon, but an important one if rodlike polymers are to be                 
              developed into three -- dimensional materials and not just fibers              
              and films.  Poly(alkylglutamate)s and other polypeptides will be               
              used to study the gelation of rodlike polymers.  Light scattering              
              and tracer diffusion measurements will help to establish the                   
              relative importance of aggregation and phase separation in                     
              gelation.
