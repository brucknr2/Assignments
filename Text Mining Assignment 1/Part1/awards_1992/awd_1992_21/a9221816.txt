Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This U.S.-Bulgaria Research award is to Dr. Martin Hertzberg of                
              the American University in Bulgaria, to work with the U.S. Bureau              
              of Mines, in cooperation (on the Bulgarian side) the Bulgarian                 
              Academy of Sciences, the University of Mining and Geology, and                 
              the Mining Research and Technology, and the Mining Research and                
              Technology Institute, to work on "Combustion Experiments and                   
              Numerical Modelling of Dust Explosions and Spontaneous                         
              Self-Heatings."  The researchers will perform experimental                     
              studies of the explosability of dusts and the spontaneous                      
              self-heating of coals, complemented by theoretical numerical                   
              modelling of those combustion processes.  The combustion of                    
              phase-heterogeneous systems plays a critical role in modern                    
              technology.  The objective of the explosability part of this                   
              research program is to study the fundamental physical processes                
              responsible for the existence of flammability limits.  The need                
              to solve the problem of spontaneous combustion of low rank coals               
              presenting severe hazards in underground Bulgarian mines provides              
              a strong incentive to reevaluate the fundamentals of the                       
              spontaneous ignition process formulated in the classical theory                
              of Semenov and Frank-Kamenetskii, which theory requires                        
              substantial modifications in order to include the processes of                 
              natural convection and gas transport into (and out of) the                     
              self-heating mass.  In addition, the exothermic/endothermic                    
              moisture transport process must be added to the exothermic                     
              surface oxidation rate of coals, and the numerical modelling of                
              those processes must be three-dimensional.                                     
                                                                                             
              This project in combustion research fulfills the program                       
              objective of advancing scientific knowledge by enabling leading                
              experts in the United States and Eastern Europe to combine                     
              complementary talents and pool resources in areas of strong                    
              mutual interest and competence.
