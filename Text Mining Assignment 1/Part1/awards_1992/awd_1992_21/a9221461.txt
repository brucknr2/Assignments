Abstract    :
                   Connectivity will link this medical school's major teaching               
              hospital (Barnes with 1743 beds) and several other units within the            
              medical center into a single "seamless" TCP/IP array of Internet               
              resources.  The likely benefits of the proposed connections are                
              great at this premier research institution.  The local                         
              infrastructure is very strong, and the network expertise is                    
              excellent.  The PI is a leader in medical information research and             
              is in a position to promote connectivity; substantial outcomes are             
              likely to result.
