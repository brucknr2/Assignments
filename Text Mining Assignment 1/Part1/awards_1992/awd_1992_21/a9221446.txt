Abstract    :
              The objective of this conference is to bring researchers and                   
              practitioners engaged in the solution of complex problems in                   
              geomechanics to present and discuss their research and experience              
              to define the state of the art in Computer Methods and Advances                
              in Geomechanics. The conference will provide an opportunity to                 
              share technological advances made all over the world, and serve                
              as the vehicle for technology transfer to engineering practice.
