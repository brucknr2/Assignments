Abstract    :
                   This proposal describes MRnet, the Minnesota Regional Network,            
              which presently links twenty-one public and private educational                
              institutions and twenty private research foundations, government               
              agencies, and commercial businesses to each other and to the                   
              NSFNET, a high speed (1.5 - 45 million bits per second) National               
              Backbone network.                                                              
                   MRnet plans to expand its capacity for connecting education               
              and research institutions and to expand its educational and user               
              into new regions of the state.  This should encourage smaller                  
              institutions to take advantage of information resources available              
              on MRnet itself or through the NSFNET.                                         
                   The items proposed for NSF support include:                               
                        -Expansion of technical and user services staff;                     
                        -Creation of a new network hub in Rochester, MN;                     
                        -Terminal servers for connecting very small member                   
                          institutions at a reasonable cost;                                 
                        -Personnel for outreach, marketing, and support of new               
                          members.
