Abstract    :
                   The objective of this project is to build an instrument that              
              will allow rapid evolution of sharp and special purpose tips for               
              scanning probe microscopes. This new instrument integrates a                   
              scanning probe microscope with a scanning electron microscope and              
              ion mill for preparing, imaging and using probe tips.  Of special              
              interest are processes involving decomposition of gases and liquid             
              films to form hard tips, ferroelectric tips, and magnetic tips.                
              The significance is that almost all scanning probe measurements,               
              expecially with the atomic force microscope, are limited now by the            
              tip.  For the atomic force microscope, there is no instrument                  
              presently available that allows researchers to do rapid tip                    
              development.  The system proposed here will allow super tips to be             
              optimized rapidly, a benefit to many users of the atomic force                 
              microscope.
