Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              A number of scientists are competing heavily in the area of                    
              synthesizing and characterizing molecular ferromagnets, due both to            
              a high level of intrinsic interest in the fundamental chemistry and            
              physics, and because of potential applications for this important              
              class of materials.  So far, the synthesis of a stable class of                
              molecular ferromagnets with a Curie temperature(Tc) above ambient              
              has eluded chemists.  This PI has recently succeeded in preparing              
              a class of transition metal phthalocyanine compounds that are                  
              stable ferromagnetic materails with high Tc.  The basis for this               
              SGER grant is to provide an opportunity to further characterize and            
              tailor magnetic properties such as coercivity, remanence and                   
              saturation field by controlling the conditions for synthesis of                
              these materails to achieve, for example optimized particle size and            
              amount of sbsorbed oxygen, and to study the role of catalysts in               
              bringing about phase transformations that yield ferromagnetism at              
              relatively low temperatures where pyrolysis is absent.
