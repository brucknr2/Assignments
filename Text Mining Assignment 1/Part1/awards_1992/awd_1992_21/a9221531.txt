Abstract    :
              The objective of this project is to study the performance of                   
              a rehabilitation scheme which can be used to correct the                       
              "weak links" in a frame system, but will simplify the                          
              construction process and reduce the time and inconvenience                     
              associated with most rehabilitation projects.  The procedure                   
              is based on the use of precast wall segments to make up the                    
              infill between columns and floors and to supplement the                        
              axial tensile capacity of the existing columns through the                     
              use of post-tensioned tendons extending vertically through                     
              the structure at the columns.                                                  
                                                                                             
              The research is divided into three parts.  The first part                      
              involves a study of techniques for constructing the panel                      
              closure strips and evaluating their performance.  The second                   
              part is directed toward a study of various methods for                         
              transferring forces at the infill panel-existing frame                         
              interface.  Finally, a large-scale model comprising several                    
              stories of the structure with infills will be constructed to                   
              verify performance and provide data on overall system                          
              response.                                                                      
                                                                                             
              This project is a part of research initiative on "Seismic                      
              Repair and Rehabilitation of Structures."
