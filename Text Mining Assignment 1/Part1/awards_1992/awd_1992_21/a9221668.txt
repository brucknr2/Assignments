Abstract    :
                   The objective of this study is to compare process related to              
              CO2 storage (ie photosynthesis and accumulation of soil C and CO2              
              release (ie. plant respiration and decomposition) for evergreen and            
              deciduous forests in two contrasting boreal climates and is part               
              of a large international study (BOREAS) to examine terrestrial                 
              atmosphere interactions in boreal ecosystems in Prince Albert                  
              National Park, Saskatchewan and nelson House, Manitoba, Canada.                
              Data collected during the study will increase our understanding of             
              the influence of major biotic and abiotic factors on carbon cycling            
              in boreal forests.  A concurrent activity will be to develop                   
              computer simulation models that we will use to examine the                     
              influence of different climate change scenarios on the growth of               
              boreal forests.                                                                
              %%%                                                                            
              The global carbon cycle recently has been the focus of much                    
              research in an attempt to explain the rising atmospheric CO2                   
              concentration; CO2 is of interest because it is a major greenhouse             
              gas.  Forests can be a net sink (ie. store CO2), a source (ie.                 
              release CO2) or in equilibrium (ie. no net change) depending upon              
              stand age, stand vigor and climate.  Boreal forest comprise                    
              approximately 25% of the total forested area in the world and                  
              contain greater than 40% of the total world soil carbon; therefore,            
              this forest biome is likely to have an important role in the global            
              carbon cycle.  Moreover, the role of boreal forests in the global              
              carbon cycle may change more in the future than any other biome                
              because general circulation models that are used to predict future             
              climate suggests that the boreal biome will experience the greatest            
              change in climate.
