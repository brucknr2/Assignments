Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This project will continue experimental studies of                             
              granivory in the Chihuahuan Desert near Portal,                                
              Arizona. The 20-ha study site contains 24 fenced plots,                        
              each 0.25 ha in area.   Investigators have maintained                          
              the removal of some or all species of rodents and/or                           
              ants from 10 plots continuously since 1977 and from an                         
              additional 14 plots since 1988.  Standardized censuses                         
              of rodents, ants, and plants provide invaluable data on                        
              responses of individuals, populations, and communities                         
              both to experimental perturbations and to natural                              
              temporal and spatial variation in the environment.                             
                                                                                             
              Results to date demonstrate: 1) long-term fluctuations                         
              in rodent and plant populations in response to                                 
              precipitation in El Nino years; 2) surprisingly                                
              constant competition among rodent species; 3) direct                           
              effects of seed predation by rodents and ants on annual                        
              plant populations; 4) indirect effects of rodents on                           
              ants, birds, and plants, and of ants on birds and                              
              plants; and 5) wholesale changes in vegetation in                              
              response to exclusion of kangaroo rats.  The research                          
              plan for the next five years includes: 1) continuation                         
              of experimental manipulations and standardized censuses                        
              of rodents, ants, and plants; 2) analysis of long-term                         
              population dynamics; 3) investigation of the                                   
              relationships between direct and indirect biotic                               
              interactions; and 4) comparison of responses to                                
              manipulations initiated in 1977 and 1988.
