Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  The North Dakota Tracer Experiment planned for the summer of              
              1993 will focus on continued study of transport, dispersion, ice               
              initiation, and hail embryo development processes in active                    
              convective clouds and storms.  The scientific goal will be to                  
              increase understanding of these processes in natural and seeded                
              clouds, and their relation to the subsequent development of                    
              precipitation (including hail).  The primary experimental                      
              techniques will employ tracer materials released from aircraft,                
              including gaseous SF6, radar chaff, and fluorescent beads (for                 
              hailstone-embryo studies).  The 1993 project will emphasize pulsed             
              releases (typical duration 30 s) of the tracer materials to                    
              facilitate studying the time evolution of transport and dispersion             
              processes and of the hydrometeors.  Releases will be made in feeder            
              clouds whenever opportunities arise, to study transport between                
              feeder and main cell, and in other cloud types as available.  The              
              South Dakota School of Mines and Technology T-28 and University of             
              North Dakota Citation will sample the clouds for SF6 as well as for            
              kinematic and microphysical characteristics.  C-band Doppler radar             
              will provide one Doppler surveillance of the origin of                         
              precipitation, and determine whether the storms have feeder cell               
              characteristics.  One mobile CLASS system will provide timely                  
              soundings of the local environment.
