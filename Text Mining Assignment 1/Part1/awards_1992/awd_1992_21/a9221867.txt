Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This research will examine the development of conceptual thought in            
              infants and young children and their ability to recall the past.               
              Until recently, we had little information about the way infants                
              conceptualize the world or how long they can recall events that                
              have happened to them.  The phenomenon known as infantile amnesia,             
              in which adults recall little or nothing about their early years,              
              suggests that infants may not be able to remember their past for               
              very long.  However, recent work in Mandler's laboratory indicates             
              that two-year-olds can recall events that occurred at age one. This            
              research program will use deferred imitation, in which children are            
              asked to imitate events they observed in the past, to measure                  
              recall in children too young to talk.                                          
                                                                                             
              There has also been little experimental work on concept formation              
              in infancy.  It has traditionally been thought that infants first              
              form concepts about concrete objects, such as dogs, chairs, and                
              cars, and only later develop broader concepts of animals,                      
              furniture, and vehicles.  However, research from Mandler's                     
              laboratory indicates that the broader concepts precede the more                
              specific ones.  This research will use several new techniques,                 
              involving the way that infants handle and explore objects, to test             
              this hypothesis.  The overall goal of the research is to provide a             
              systematic body of knowledge about the preverbal foundations of                
              thinking and remembering, so that we can better understand what                
              young children need to know in order to learn language.
