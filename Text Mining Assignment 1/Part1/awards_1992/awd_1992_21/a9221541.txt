Abstract    :
              This action covers three separate tasks for improving the annual               
              Survey of Industrial Research and Development conducted for NSF                
              by the Bureau of the Census.  Task I is the selection of a new                 
              survey sample, Task II is the design, development, and                         
              implementation of new survey processing software, and Task III is              
              a follow-up telephone survey of nonrespondents to the 1991 survey              
              round which will provide a more complete understanding of the                  
              reasons for nonresponse.  NSF and Census staff have previously                 
              identified these areas for improvement.                                        
                                                                                             
              Under authority granted by the National Science Foundation                     
              Act of 1950, NSF collects and disseminates descriptive economic                
              statistics, as well as other pertinent information, about                      
              scientific and technological resource utilization and activities.              
              Data collected by the Survey of Research and Development in                    
              Industry, when used alone or in combination with data obtained                 
              through other NSF statistical and analytical activities, provides              
              policy makers with an overview of R&D funding and performance in               
              the United States.  The current survey is being conducted under                
              interagency agreement SRS 92-09661.
