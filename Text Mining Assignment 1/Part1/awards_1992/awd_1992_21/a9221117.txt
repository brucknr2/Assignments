Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Development has proven to be a powerful analytic tool for                      
              dissociating different forms of learning and memory in Aplysia.  In            
              this project a developmental strategy will be used to explore two              
              key questions:  (1) What is the relationship between nonassociative            
              and associative learning?  Having already determined when                      
              nonassociative learning (sensitization) emerges, it will first be              
              determined when associative learning (classical conditioning)                  
              emerges.  Following this behavioral analysis, both forms of                    
              learning will be compared at several mechanistic levels:  (i)                  
              biophysical; (ii) biochemical; and (iii) synaptic.  (2) What is the            
              relationship between short-term memory and long-term memory?                   
              Having already determined when short-term memory (minutes-hours)               
              for sensitization emerges, it will first be determined when long-              
              term memory (days-weeks) emerges.  Following this behavioral                   
              analysis, the development of short-term and long-term memory will              
              be investigated at biophysical, biochemical, and synaptic levels of            
              analysis.                                                                      
                                                                                             
              By using development as a dissecting tool to uniquely dissociate               
              and analyze complex behavioral and neuronal processes in a                     
              preparation such as Aplysia, which is highly suited for a                      
              mechanistic analysis, this research project can significantly                  
              advance scientific knowledge in an area of fundamental importance:             
              the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying learning and                  
              memory.***//
