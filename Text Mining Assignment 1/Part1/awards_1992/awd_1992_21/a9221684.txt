Abstract    :
              Confirmation and Extension of Magnetospheric Radar                              
               Observations at SURA                                                          
               This proposal is to initiate the first step toward realizing the             
              transition of a powerful Soviet military facility to the peaceful              
              study of the geospace environment, the domain of solar-terrestrial             
              science.  We envision that the results of this study will reinforce            
              efforts towards a major long-range opportunity for joint                       
              US/Russia/Ukraine development of a magnetosheric radar facility.               
              In addition, it seems possible that the same facility could be used            
              as a powerful mesosphere-stratosphere-troposphere (MST) facility.              
              Strong evidence exists that Soviet researchers directly detected,              
              through remote sensing with a magnetospheric radar, the origin of              
              the auroral borealis.  This region has only been penetrated before             
              by a few satellites which, due to some intrinsic limitations of                
              spacecraft, provide inadequate data in the key regions.  We propose            
              to test, and potentially confirm, this important new tool for                  
              ground-based access to the geospace enviroment.
