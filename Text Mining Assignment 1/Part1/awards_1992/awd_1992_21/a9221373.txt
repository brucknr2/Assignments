Abstract    :
                   The University of Redlands is establishing a connection to                
              NSFNET via a 56,000 bit per second line through the University of              
              California at Riverside and the CERFNET mid-level network.  The                
              connection enables the school's faculty and students to communicate            
              and collaborate with the international scientific and educational              
              community, and to access network resources such as libraries,                  
              databases and supercomputers.  This award funds part of the costs              
              for two years.
