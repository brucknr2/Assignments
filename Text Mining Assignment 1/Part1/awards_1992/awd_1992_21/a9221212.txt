Abstract    :
              Professor Seyferth of MIT will conduct research in the field of                
              organometallic chemistry with funding from the Inorganic,                      
              Bioinorganic, and Organometallic Program of the Chemistry                      
              Division.  He will investigate the reactions of a group of                     
              organic dianions with early transition metallocene                             
              dihalides and related compounds.  The dianions are species in                  
              which the charge is delocalized over a trigonal array of four                  
              atoms, with the acetone dianion being typical.  They can react                 
              as C,C or C,X nucleophiles to generate four-membered                           
              metallacyclic ring systems.  Seyferth will explore the scope of                
              synthesis of these systems as well as their reactivity.  He                    
              will also investigate metal exchange reactions of organolithium                
              compounds with transition-metal carbonyl complexes bearing                     
              heavy-metal substituents.                                                      
              %%%                                                                            
              A variety of strongly basic organic compounds will be prepared,                
              in which two protons have been removed.  The chemical reactions                
              of these bases with compounds containing transition metal ions                 
              will be investigated, because they lead to unusual                             
              four-membered rings containing the metal ion and the organic                   
              base.  Of special interest is the question of which atoms of                   
              the organic bases will be incorporated in the rings.  It is                    
              anticipated that these unusual compounds will find use in the                  
              synthesis of organic substances.
