Abstract    :
              This proposal describes an integrated research program in nuclear              
              astrophysics, nuclear physics, and fundamental particle physics.               
              Most of the nuclear astrophysics studies involve reactions on                  
              radioactive nuclides, and thus require use of radioactive beam                 
              facilities.  Most of these reactions are of interest to                        
              primordial nucleosynthesis, as they will allow prediction of                   
              abundances of nuclides heavier than carbon in the big bang, thus               
              providing new tests of models of primordial nucleosynthesis.                   
              Another study is directed at the p-process of nucleosynthesis,                 
              thought to occur in extreme stellar conditions.   The information              
              resulting from these studies also will contribute to the general               
              body of knowledge of nuclear states in nuclei far from stability.              
              A fundamental particle study will search for stable or long lived              
              "strangelets," nuclei composed of up, down and strange quarks, of              
              importance to theories of nuclear matter.  The theoretical work                
              focuses on new abundance predictions for primordial                            
              nucleosynthesis using the reaction rates determined in the                     
              experimental studies.  Work of gamma-ray bursts will attempt to                
              elucidate the nature of those phenomena.  Finally, preliminary                 
              work on a new kind of supernova detector will continue; it will                
              be capable of testing models of stellar collapse, and can also                 
              measure the masses of heavy neutrinos to unprecedented accuracy.
