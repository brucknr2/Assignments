Abstract    :
                   The Rocky Mountain Institute of Software Engineering is                   
              coordinating a workshop on architectures for process-sensitive                 
              engineering environments, to be held September 22-24, 1992,                    
              in Boulder, Colorado.  The workshop's purposes are:  obtain                    
              a good understanding of architectural issues for process-                      
              sensitive environments, compare alternative existing                           
              architectures, and develop a general "game plan" for future                    
              work.                                                                          
                   Participation is by invitation only, with attendees                       
              chosen to assure a balance of practitioner and researcher                      
              viewpoints as well as a balanced participation from industry,                  
              government and academic organizations.  All attendees will be                  
              required to prepare position statements addressing topics                      
              identified by the workshop organizers.  Most of the workshop                   
              will be devoted to working-group discussions of the topics;                    
              occasional presentations and periodic plenary sessions will                    
              be held to foster cross-fertilization among the working                        
              groups.  A report on the workshop will be broadly disseminated                 
              throughout the software engineering community.  This report                    
              will augment the results of other process and environment                      
              related activities such as the Software Development                            
              Environment Conferences and the International Software Process                 
              Conferences and Workshops.
