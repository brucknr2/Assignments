Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  This project is an ethnographic study of the process of                   
              cultural identity construction by native Hawaiian activists                    
              involved in a movement for sovereignty.  During an eighteen                    
              month fieldwork period the researcher will investigate two                     
              Hawaiian grassroots organizations.  One is currently                           
              involved in a land dispute over geothermal development,                        
              while the other is engaged in representing the past at an                      
              archaeological site.  The research will examine how                            
              activists groups define and construct group identity on                        
              three levels public, group, and private) through                               
              demonstrations, rituals, ceremonies, and performances.  This                   
              research will contribute to ongoing debates in anthropology                    
              concerned with cultural constructions and objectification,                     
              representation, and the invention of tradition.
