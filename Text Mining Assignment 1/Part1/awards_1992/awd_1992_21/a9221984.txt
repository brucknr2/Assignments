Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The voltage-sensitive sodium channel is an integral component of               
              impulse conduction by neuronal cells, transmitting the initial                 
              inward current during an action potential.  The overall goal of Dr.            
              Goldin's study is to determine the roles of specific structural                
              regions of the channel that are involved in gating.  There are four            
              putative transmembrane amphipathic helices termed S4 in the sodium             
              channel that have been proposed to function as voltage sensor                  
              regions involved in voltage-dependent activation of the channel.               
              Dr. Goldin will test this by constructing mutations at comparable              
              positions in each of the S4 regions, and by determining if each of             
              the charges is contributing to the effective valence of activation.            
              His second objective is to determine if these same voltage sensors             
              are involved in the process of slow sodium channel inactivation.               
              While fast inactivation of sodium channels is thought to be                    
              essentially independent of voltage, slow inactivation very likely              
              involves some voltage sensitivity independent of activation.  The              
              effects of each of the S4 region mutations in slow inactivation                
              will be tested to determine if the S4 regions are functioning as               
              inactivation voltage gating charge of the channel.  Dr. Goldin will            
              accomplish this by using a newly developed voltage clamp to measure            
              gating currents of channels containing mutations in each of the                
              four S4 regions.  These studies should enhance our knowledge about             
              the normal function of the voltage-sensitive sodium channel,                   
              ultimately helping to understand the pathological processes that               
              affect channel function in disease and to design pharmaceuticals               
              that interact with channels of specific tissues.
