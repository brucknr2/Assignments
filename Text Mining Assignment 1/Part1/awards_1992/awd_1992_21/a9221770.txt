Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Many biological processes cycle rhythmically over a twenty-four                
              hour (circadian) period.  Disruptions of this rhythm cause "jet                
              lag" and are a feature of many neurological and psychiatric                    
              diseases.  In mammals, the pacemaker that controls this rhythmicity            
              lies in a brain structure called the suprachiasmatic nucleus of the            
              hypothalamus.  Cells in this nucleus exhibit many cyclic                       
              properties, even when removed from the brain and studied in a dish,            
              in vitro.  Unfortunately, the isolated cells tend to be unstable               
              and thus are difficult to study for long periods.  Dr. Earnest has             
              developed a genetically engineered suprachiasmatic cell that                   
              replicates in culture but still demonstrates properties of intact              
              suprachiasmatic cells.  With this NSF small grant for exploratory              
              research, he will screen colonies of these cells to determine which            
              ones exhibit the circadian time-keeping function.  If the proposed             
              projects demonstrate that circadian timekeeping is a stable                    
              functional characteristic of suprachiasmatic clones, potential                 
              applications of this experimental model would be limitless and                 
              could serve to rapidly advance our knowledge of the cellular and               
              molecular organization of the circadian pacemaker mechanism in the             
              brain.  Increased understanding would aid the development of                   
              therapies for sleep disorders due to altered time schedules, space             
              flight, and neurological disease.***//
