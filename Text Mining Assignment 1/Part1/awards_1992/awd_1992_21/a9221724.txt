Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  Human biologists have studied the adaptations of high altitude            
              populations for decades, and have established the existence of                 
              physiological differences between high altitude Andean and                     
              Himalayan groups (and low altitude groups).  However, no progress              
              has been made in determining the mode of inheritance of critical               
              components in the oxygen transport systems of either Himalayan or              
              Andean high altitude populations, so that currently it is not                  
              possible to deduce that the differences are hereditary,                        
              environomental, or a product of gene-environment interactions.                 
                                                                                             
                   Employing a novel statistical genetic analytic technique on               
              family data from these areas, this project will address this                   
              important issue.  A pilot study suggests the chances for success               
              are excellent.
