Abstract    :
              This award is the starter grant increment of Dr. Chmelka's                     
              Postdoctoral Fellowship in Chemistry. The work will develop the                
              methodology of multipolar zero-field NMR through instrumental                  
              improvements. Sample shuttling times will be reduced so as to                  
              make it possible to study systems with shorter spin-lattice                    
              relaxation times. The range of accessible dipolar couplings                    
              will be extended to 50 kHz so that solid organic compounds may                 
              be studied. The new instrumentaion will be applied to the study                
              of molecular clusters in partially ordered systems.

              Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, NMR, is an important                  
              method for determining molecular structure. The NMR approach                   
              will be developed to study solid systems of importance to                      
              understanding catalysis in zeolites. These are systems of great                
              commercial importance.
