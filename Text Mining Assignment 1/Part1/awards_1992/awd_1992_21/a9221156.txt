                                                                              9221156  Witt   
                Semiconductor bulk crystal growth suffers from a gap between  theory and
              experiment which is to a large extent  attributable to the non-availability of
              quantifiable thermal  boundary conditions. With focus on this deficiency it is 
              proposed to design, construct, characterize and test a heat-  pipe-based heat
              transfer control system for semiconductor  crystal growth by the Czochralski
              technique.  The system  will involve a three part heat pipe assembly with
              sodium as  heat transfer fluid.  The establishment of controllable and 
              quantifiable axi-symmetric thermal boundary conditions is to  be ascertained
              through temperature measurements with a  thermocouple array and on the basis of
              thermal imaging.  Its  functionality is to be tested in growth of Ga doped 
              germanium at crystal diameters of up to 2 cm. The  relationship between the
              prevailing boundary conditions and  the crystal growth behavior is to be
              determined through  quantitative segregation analyses.  These analyses are made
               possible with the introduction during growth of current  controlled crystal
              melt interface demarcation (revealed by  etching and phase contrast microscopy
              on axial crystal  samples) and quantitative composition determination based on 
              spreading resistance measurements.  %%%  Semiconductor crystal growth, the
              basis for solid state  device technology, is conducted on a largely empirical
              basis  and the resulting materials fall short of theoretical  performance
              limits. The proposed research is expected to  contribute to narrowing the gap
              between theory and  experiment.  It will provide a means for increased control 
              over growth related defect formation in semiconductors and  is expected to
              establish a basis for more effective use of  mathematical modeling to achieve
              specific growth control  objectives.  ***
