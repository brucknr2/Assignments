Abstract    :
              The South Pole Air Shower Experiment (SPASE) is a large                        
              (approximately 100 meter square) array of scintillation detectors              
              which measures very energetic particles produced by interactions of            
              cosmic ray with the Earth's atmosphere.  Spase was first installed             
              at South Pole in late 1987 and has operated almost continuously                
              since then with several improvements.  The experiment is intended              
              to search for sources of gamma rays with the expectation that such             
              sources would also be the long sought sources of charged cosmic                
              rays.  In the first 5 years of operation SPASE has not found an                
              unambiguous constant source, though there is a candidate.  There               
              are also candidate pulsed sources which may have been detected.                
              These results are consistent with all similar experiment in the                
              Southern Hemisphere.  It is planned to operate SPASE in conjunction            
              with the new detectors which are being installed as part of the                
              AMANDA (Antarctic Muon And Neutrino Detector Array).  These new                
              detectors will provide additional information on the muon content              
              of the air showers and therefore reduce the charged cosmic ray                 
              background and increase the likelihood of detection of gamma rays.
