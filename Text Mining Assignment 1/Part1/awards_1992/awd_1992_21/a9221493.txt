Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This award provides support for the travel of Dr. William Randle               
              of the University of Georgia to conduct cooperative research                   
              with Dr. Jane Elizabeth Lancaster of the newly instituted                      
              New Zealand Crown Research Institute for Crop and Food Research.               
              The research will investigate biochemical aspects of sulfur                    
              partitioning in the onion (Allium cepa). The presence of sulfur                
              compounds in onions is of importance in determining flavor                     
              intensity. The research will describe how sulfur is                            
              differentially mobilized and partitioned among cultivars in a                  
              plant expending considerable energy in sulfur metabolism, will                 
              determine sulfur-compound accumulation in the flavor biosynthetic              
              pathway, and will describe the role of flavor enzymes in                       
              differential flavor intensity.                                                 
                                                                                             
              The project joins the complementary skills of Dr. Randle as a                  
              geneticist and plant breeder and those of Dr. Lancaster in the                 
              biochemistry and physiology of sulfur compounds. Since the                     
              principal investigators work in different hemispheres, two crops               
              of onions can be produced under natural photoperiods in a single               
              year. Travel by Dr. Lancaster to the University of Georgia will                
              be funded through the New Zealand Ministry of Research, Science                
              and Technology (MORST).
