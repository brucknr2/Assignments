Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This is an empirical examination of the relationships between                  
              university-industry research interaction and industrial innovation.            
              Specifically, it focusses on improved understanding of the process             
              and key barriers and facilitators/incentives.  The expected                    
              significance of this research is that it will help clarify the                 
              "cloud of indicators" or lists of "possible benefits" which have               
              been posited for industry-university interaction and to identify a             
              limited number of "key indicators"  which can provide a basis for              
              further research, implementation and decision-making.                          
                                                                                             
              The specific objectives are:  to develop a "Conceptual Flow Model"             
              for the process of University/Industry Interaction and its                     
              downstream impacts on industrial innovation; to identify and                   
              develop key indicators and measures (scales, attributes) for events            
              and conditions at each stage, including the stages of short term               
              and longer term outcomes and impacts; to identify key barriers and             
              facilitators which act at the various stages (some act at several              
              stages) and to develop indicators and measures for them; and to                
              collect data on indicators and barriers/facilitators from a small              
              sample of universities and industrial organizations engaged in or              
              attempting to develop collaboration in Science and Technology.
