Abstract    :
                   This award covers experimental elementary particle                        
              physics research on the constituent structure of matter by a                   
              group at Penn State University in collaboration with other NSF                 
              and DOE supported scientists.  The group will continue                         
              studying rare mesonic and hadronic states at Brookhaven and at                 
              Fermilab.  They will also study the quark structure of matter                  
              in electron scattering experiments at HERA in Hamburg,                         
              Germany.
