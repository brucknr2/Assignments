Abstract    :
              professor Richard Ernst of the University of Utah will conduct                 
              research on the chemistry of metal-pentadienyl compounds with                  
              funding from the IBO program of the Chemsitry Division.                        
              Titanium will be the primary metal center, with other                          
              early-transition metal centers such as chromium and zirconium                  
              playing a secondary role.  Coupling reactions of the                           
              coordinated pentadienyl ligands with unsaturated organic                       
              molecules can form organic rings, and they will be explored                    
              extensively by Ernst.  Ligands containing two conjugated                       
              pentadienyl fragments (open fulvalenes) will also be studied                   
              for their ability to bind two metal centers;  paramagnetic                     
              derivatives of such dinuclear compounds will be of interest                    
              because the conjugation should foster strong communication                     
              between the two metal centers.                                                 
              %%%                                                                            
              Atoms of titanium and other metals will be attached to organic                 
              molecules containing five-membered carbon chains with two                      
              double bonds.  By modifying the organic molecules in this way                  
              they can react with other organic molecules containing one                     
              double bond to form organic rings.  Such ring-forming reactions                
              will be investigated in some detail because of their potential                 
              as routes to complex organic products.
