Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                          PARALLEL PROCESSING IN A NEURAL NETWORK                            
                                                                                             
                                                                                            
              The goal of the proposed research is to gain further insight into              
              mechanisms of parallel processing in the nervous system.                       
              Research will focus on the vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR), which                
              stabilizes vision by producing eye rotations that counterbalance               
              head rotations.  The VOR is mediated by vestibular nuclei neurons              
              (VNNs).  Recent neural network models suggest that the                         
              distributed encoding of eye-movement commands VNNs results                     
              because VNNs operate in parallel.  The underlying assumption is                
              that parallelism is critical to VOR function.  The primary aim of              
              the project is to quantitatively test this assumption by studying              
              the effects on VOR of lesioning varying numbers of VNNs.                       
              Experimental subjects will be goldfish because they have a                     
              suitably well-developed VOR.                                                   
                                                                                             
              To generate predictions, varying numbers of VNNs will be removed               
              from a highly parallel and realistic model of the goldfish VOR.                
              The initial prediction is that VNN lesions should degrade VOR                  
              function by increasing VOR harmonic distortion.  This will be                  
              tested experimentally by comparing VOR eye-movements before and                
              after VNN lesions.  Data will be quantified using eye-velocity                 
              power spectra.  Lesion size will be quantified histologically.                 
              Results will be incorporated into larger and more realistic VOR                
              neural network models, which will be implemented on massively                  
              parallel computers.             //
