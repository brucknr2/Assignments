Abstract    :
                   Furman University has installed a TCP/IP network that links               
              the equipment in the major academic and administrative buildings on            
              campus.  It requests support from NSF for connection of this campus            
              network to SURAnet.  SURAnet is the midlevel network located in the            
              southeastern United States.  It will provide operations management             
              and information services and it give Furman University a 56                    
              thousand bits per second connection to the NSFNET, a high speed                
              (1.5 - 45 million bits per second) National Backbone network.                  
                   The University needs greater functionality and network speed              
              to be able to access supercomputers, libraries, and make file                  
              transfers along with being able to collaborate with peers at other             
              schools on common projects.  Students and faculty research will                
              benefit from the link.  This is also a unique opportunity for the              
              school to explore innovative educational resources.
