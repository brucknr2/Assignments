Abstract    :
                   This award covers experimental Elementary Particle                        
              Physics Research on the constituent structure of matter by a                   
              group at Johns Hopkins University in collaboration with other                  
              NSF and DOE supported scientists.  The group will continue                     
              studying electron-positron annihilations as a member of the L3                 
              collaboration, and neutrino oscillations in the NOMAD                          
              experiment, both at CERN, Switzerland.  They will also                         
              continue research and development of wedge silicon detectors                   
              at Johns Hopkins University.
