Abstract    :
              Lilja         Automated assignment of separate loop iterations to  different
              processors is a powerful technique for scheduling  programs to run  on parallel
              computers.  This project is  investigating four research approaches to loop
              scheduling:   investigation of processor allocation strategies, minimization of
               time in loop-control critical sections, techniques for scheduling  loops with
              large but regular execution time variations, and  adaptive techniques for
              minimizing memory reference effects.   Research methods include simulation and
              measurement of prototype  implementations on several parallel computers.
