Abstract    :
                   The Memphis Educational Computer Communications Association               
              (MECCA) is an informal multicampus consortium newly formed for                 
              the purpose of promoting computer networking among Memphis                     
              educational institutions, as well as promoting access to the                   
              Internet and the NSFNET Backbone.                                              
                   This association will promote an interinstitutional network               
              of campus computer resources for all educational institutions in               
              Memphis metropolitan area.  The University of Tennessee at                     
              Memphis will closely coordinate and serve as a technological                   
              catalyst for local networking and nationwide collaborations.  It               
              will coordinate with all the educational institutions in the area              
              interested in video conferencing and distance learning, as well                
              as collaborative research projects across the state.                           
                   A primary goal of MECCA is to facilitate collaborative                    
              projects and sharing of resources between institution, including               
              those outside the state.  IT will provide management and                       
              information services to all Memphis area institutions.                         
                   The universities need greater functionality and network                   
              speed to be able to access supercomputers, libraries, and make                 
              file transfers along with being able to implement a more reliable              
              mail system. Students and faculty research will benefit from the               
              link.  This is also a unique opportunity for the schools to                    
              explore innovative educational resources.
