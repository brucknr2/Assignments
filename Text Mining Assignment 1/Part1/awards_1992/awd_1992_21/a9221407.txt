Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The earliest phase of nervous system development is                            
              characterized by large scale movements of cells.  First,                       
              these cells must separate from the outer layer of the early                    
              embryo; secondly, they must obtain specific positions                          
              within the embryo.  To reach these positions, the cells in                     
              many cases must migrate considerable distances.  Upon                          
              reaching their proper location, they become stationary and                     
              form stable contacts with each other.  It is of great                          
              importance to understand on a molecular level how these                        
              cellular processes are controlled.  This project will use                      
              the embryonic optic lobe as a model system to analyze the                      
              molecular basis of morphogenetic movements during neuronal                     
              development.  Using a variety of markers, the  position and                    
              movement of these cells can be readily followed throughout                     
              normal and mutant development.  Experiments will focus on                      
              the phenotypic and molecular characterization of a gene                        
              called sine oculis (so), which is necessary for the                            
              development of the optic lobe.  Mutations of so cause                          
              failure of optic lobe invagination.  Most recent analyses                      
              show that so encodes a putative transcription factor, that                     
              is a protein that is capable of turning on or off the                          
              expression of other genes.  It is anticipated that the                         
              analysis of so and its function during the development of                      
              the optic lobe will answer many important questions.
