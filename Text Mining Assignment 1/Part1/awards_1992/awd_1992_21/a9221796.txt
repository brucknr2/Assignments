Abstract    :
              The teleprogramming system, developed under                                    
              the current grant from the NSF, provides the                                   
              capability of performing manipulative tasks                                    
              in remote, time-delayed, environments, such                                    
              as undersea and in space.  The                                                 
              teleprogramming system provides for a                                          
              symbolic communications link between a                                         
              virtual reality master station and a remote                                    
              slave robot.  This effort continues the                                        
              research on teleprogramming, to complete the                                   
              system by including:  automatic synthetic                                      
              fixturing; model acquisition; providing for                                    
              the use of fasteners and tools; reactive                                       
              slave motions and task input.                                                  
                                                                                             
              This research is being conducted in                                            
              conjunction with the Laboratoire                                               
              d'Automatique et d'Analyse des Systemes of                                     
              the Centre National de la Recherche                                            
              Scientifique of France; in France the                                          
              concentration is on higher-level task input                                    
              to the system.  We will also work with the                                     
              Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute and with                                    
              IFREMER to prepare for a sea test of the                                       
              system.//
