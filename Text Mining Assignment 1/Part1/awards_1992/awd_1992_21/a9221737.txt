Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This project focuses on the ethnomathematics and the metaphorical              
              associations and narrative uses of numbers among Quechua-speaking              
              peoples of the Bolivian and Peruvian Andes.  Research will                     
              involve language study,  linguistic research, and ethnographic                 
              fieldwork.  The goal of the project is to produce a foundational               
              study of Quechua ethnomathematics, the syntax of number words,                 
              and the grammatical structures of numerical expressions and                    
              arithmetical and mathematical concepts and operations.  The                    
              purpose of the study is two-fold: first, to enlarge and enrich                 
              our understanding of number and logical and spatial                            
              configuration, and their organization into systems  or                         
              structures, among one of the largest populations of speakers of a              
              native language in the Americas; and second, to develop an                     
              understanding of mathematics and numerical sciences in of the                  
              khipu, the knotted-string records used as mnemonic devices by the              
              Incas in pre-Columbian times for recording quantitative data and               
              historical/mythical narratives.
