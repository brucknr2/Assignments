Abstract    :
              A three day workshop will be held on the                                       
              topic of marine riser mechanics during                                         
              September 29, 1992 through October 1, 1992.                                    
              The purpose is to establish the state of the art                               
              and outline a rational five-year research plan                                 
              to address the various aspects of analysis and                                 
              design of marine risers.  In particular, the                                   
              topics of design, structural mechanics, model                                  
              tests and field measurements, flow induced                                     
              vibrations, and loading conditions will be                                     
              studied.  The best forty people from around                                    
              the world have agreed to particpate in this                                    
              workshop, contribute written discussions or                                    
              papers and write the final report.  The                                        
              majority of the people agreed to pay most of                                   
              their expenses which provides a high leverage                                  
              to the NSF money.  An important aspect of                                      
              this effort is that it will provide well though                                
              research advice to the NSF offshore                                            
              Technology Research Center of the University                                   
              of Texas at Austin and Texas A&M at                                            
              College Station.  The workshop will be                                         
              organized and chaired by Professor Michael                                     
              M. Bernitsa who will also be the editor of the                                 
              workshop report.  Professor R. Miksad of the                                   
              University of Texas at Austin will co-chair the                                
              workshop.
