Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Ages, Kinematics, and Chemistry of Stellar Populations.                        
                                                                                             
              A program begun in 1991 will be carried to completion in the solar             
              neighborhood wherein Dr. Laird, together with Dr. Bruce Carney at              
              the University of North Carolina, will identify several thousand               
              G dwarf stars, then determine accurate radial velocities and                   
              metallicities to test the discrete versus continuum models of the              
              thick disk and thin disk populations.  The local sample will be                
              complemented by an on-going program aimed at the outer Galactic                
              disk, now detected in the direction of the southern Galactic warp.             
              The age of the thin disk relative to the thick disk and halo will              
              be derived using field binary stars.  The study of the nearest                 
              neighboring extragalactic disk population, that of the Large                   
              Magellanic Cloud, will be studied from high precision radial                   
              velocities and metallicities of giant stars.
