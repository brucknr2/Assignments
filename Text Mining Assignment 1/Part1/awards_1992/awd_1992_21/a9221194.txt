Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Structure, Rotation, and Magnetic Fields in Starless Bok Globules.             
                                                                                             
              In order to better understand the conditions of star formation and             
              processes in molecular clouds, Dr. Clemens will carry out an                   
              investigation of the relation between the structures and kinematics            
              of small clouds and the properties of the magnetic fields threading            
              those clouds.  This study is aimed at understanding the physical               
              conditions present in clouds prior to star formation, in particular            
              the occurrence frequencies, distributions, and natures of embedded             
              magnetic fields and angular momenta.  Correlations will be sought              
              between the magnetic and kinematic properties, such as aligned                 
              magnetic and rotation axes, vorticity or streaming of the field                
              lines, and length scales in the magnetic field and gas clumps.
