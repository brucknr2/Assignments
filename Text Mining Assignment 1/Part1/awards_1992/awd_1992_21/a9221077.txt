Abstract    :
                   The experiments proposed here will measure the rates of                   
              spread, patterns of infection, and fitness consequences of barley              
              yellow dwarf infection in a natural plant host in the field.  Dr.              
              Kelly will test whether this viral disease causes an advantage for             
              sex by either (1) more frequent infection of common genotypes, or              
              (2) more frequent infection of "old" genotypes.  The results will              
              provide evidence of the evolutionary significance of sexual                    
              reproduction in relation to disease, and more generally elucidate              
              the roles diseases play in favoring genetic and species diversity              
              within communities.  Of more practical significance, the proposed              
              study will provide important data on the natural ecology of an                 
              economically important cereal virus, and provide clues for the                 
              development of suitable strategies of biocontrol of viral diseases             
              in crop plants.
