Abstract    :
              9221312  Westberg         Isoprene and monoterpenes naturally emitted from
              vegetation  are known to play a significant role in the atmospheric cycles of 
              trace gases such as ozone, carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide.   However,
              uncertainties related to the emission rates of these  biogenic hydrocarbons
              from forests and to the dilution rate of  gases within and above a forest
              canopy prohibit a quantitative  understanding of the role these hydrocarbons
              play in the  atmospheric carbon cycle.  In this project biogenic emission-fate 
              studies with emphasis on a boreal forest will be studied.  This  work will be
              integrated into the Boreal Ecosystem-Atmosphere Study  (BOREAS).  The PIs will
              address three tasks set forth in the BOREAS  Science Plan:  1) determination of
              biogenic hydrocarbon fluxes, 2)  examination of physical exchange processes,
              and 3) ambient  measurement of trace gases that are important contributors to 
              atmosheric chemistry in the region.  The experimental measurement  phase of
              each initiative will involve collaborative efforts between  the PIs research
              group and science teams from other agencies.  The  biogenic hydrocarbon
              emission studies will consist of a joint  effort between Washington State
              University (WSU) and the research  team headed by Pat Zimmerman at the National
              Center for Atmospheric  Research (NCAR).  ***
