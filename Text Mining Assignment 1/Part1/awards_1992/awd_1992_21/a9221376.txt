Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  This project will permit a productive senior scholar to                   
              gain training in GIS, a computer intensive technique                           
              employed to create geographic data bases that can be                           
              spatially manipulated.  An important part of the work will                     
              be developing ways in which to link ethnographic data with                     
              spatial data in order to deal with the problem of                              
              agricultural intensification in an area of Mexico that is                      
              economically realigning itself as a result of decline in the                   
              oil boom of the 1970s.  This training will allow the                           
              research gain methodological expertise that will permit the                    
              analysis of ethnographic phenomena on a regional basis, a                      
              major improvement over a usual narrow ethnographic                             
              perspective.  As a result, ethnographic trends over entire                     
              regions will be described in greater detail than would                         
              otherwise be possible and questions about regional trends                      
              that could not otherwise be asked without this new technique                   
              will be studied.  In addition, the researcher will be able                     
              to train graduate students in this important technique.
