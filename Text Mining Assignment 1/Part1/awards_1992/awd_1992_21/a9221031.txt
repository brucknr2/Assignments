Abstract    :
                   Research will test the hypothesis that climatic change in the             
              Upper Peninsula of Michigan has produced changes in aquatic                    
              environments as it has caused range expansions of mesic tree                   
              species.  Cooling climate should reduce evapotranspiration causing             
              lake levels to rise and major ion concentrations of lake water to              
              decline.  Bogs and fens should also expand under the cooler, wetter            
              climate of the late Holocene.  Past lake levels will be determined             
              at Sylvania Wilderness and Recreation Area, Michigan, using                    
              multiple, dated sediment cores from the shallow waters of a lake.              
              Ages of bog development will be determined using radiocarbon dating            
              of peat cores.  Past lake water chemistry will be determined using             
              diatom microfossils from the sediment cores                                    
              %%%                                                                            
              The results of this study should shed light on the impacts of                  
              climatic change on aquatic environments and provide an independent             
              record of climatic change to compare with the terrestrial                      
              vegetation.
