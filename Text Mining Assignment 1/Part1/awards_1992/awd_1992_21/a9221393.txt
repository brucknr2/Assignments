Abstract    :
                   The project proposes connecting the computer network at the               
              University of Connecticut Health Center (UCHC) to Internet, a                  
              worldwide computer network based on the TCP/IP communications                  
              protocol.  Included in Internet are the numerous NSF-assisted                  
              institutions that comprise NSFNET.  The connection will allow                  
              collaborations between faculty, researchers, librarians, staff,                
              hospitals, and research centers.  This is of special importance to             
              UCHC's library because the National Library of Medicine has                    
              designated it the New England Regional Library in the National                 
              Network of Libraries of Medicine.                                              
                   The linkage will rely on a regional network, the New England              
              Academic and Research Network (NEARnet), that presently serves                 
              several nearby sites in Hartford.  A 56-kbit-per-second leased                 
              phone line will connect UCHC to NEARnet's present termination at               
              the University of Hartford.  NEARnet will operate Cisco IGS/R                  
              routers at each end of the line.  At UCHC, the router will connect             
              to our existing copper and fiber Ethernet system.  Simultaneously,             
              UCHC will fund major fiber-optic improvements to its local network.            
                   Apart from assisting clinical and research collaboration, the             
              connection will allow UCHC to develop servers for public domain                
              software and to make its library catalog searchable from remote                
              sites.
