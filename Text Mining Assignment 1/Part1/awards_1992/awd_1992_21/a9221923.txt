Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This is a joint seminar proposed by Dr.                                        
              William Wang, the University of California,                                    
              Berkeley, and Professor Ovid Tseng,                                            
              National Chung Cheng University supported                                      
              by the AIT (U.S.)-CCNAA (Taiwan)                                               
              Cooperative Science Program.  This seminar                                     
              will focus on language and its                                                 
              psychobiological bases.  The seminar will                                      
              explore how language is organized within                                       
              the human biological systems, with                                             
              particular attention paid to the Chinese                                       
              language.                                                                      
                                                                                             
              Three basic features of Chinese stand out                                      
              in contrast with "European" language:  the                                     
              virtual absence of inflectional morphology,                                    
              the use of lexical tones, and the                                              
              morphosyllabic nature of the writing                                           
              system.  Most theories in the                                                  
              psychobiological bases of language have                                        
              been primarily built on the features of                                        
              "European" languages.  The seminar to                                          
              include Chinese can greatly broaden the                                        
              bases for deducing the current theories and                                    
              provide for a broad range of variations in                                     
              human language.
