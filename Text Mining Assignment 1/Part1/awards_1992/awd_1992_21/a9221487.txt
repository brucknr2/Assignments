Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The goal of this work is to conduct a comprehensive set of                     
              synthetic, mechanistic, and X-ray structural experiments on two                
              types of carboxylate salts having alkene or acetylene groups.                  
              Solid-state reactions will be induced by irradiation (UV, X-rays,              
              gamma rays) and/or by heating.  The investigation will focus on the            
              physical and chemical mechanism of the reactions.  These                       
              experiments will lead to improvements in the understanding of                  
              structure-reactivity relationships for solid-state reactions, and              
              in the effecient planning and execution of stereospecific and                  
              regiospecific syntheses in solids.  To enhance the understanding of            
              the radiation chemistry of molecular crystals, metal complexes will            
              be irradiated by synchrotron x-radiation at specific wavelength                
              near the absorption edge of the metal.                                         
              %%%                                                                            
              The distinct advantages of solid-state syntheses of chemical                   
              compounds include improvements in efficiency or selectivity, and               
              the ability to prepare compounds unavailable by conventional                   
              solution chemistry at greatly improved yields.  A broad                        
              investigation is proposed on the solid-state reactivity of salts of            
              unsaturated carboxylic acids.  The discovery of extensive general              
              reactivity, particularly for metal salts, promises to open new                 
              areas of solid-state synthesis.  The mechanism of single crystal               
              reactions will be probed from both chemical and physical points of             
              view.  Information gained regarding the role of the metal in the               
              reactions of unsaturated carboxylate will enhance the understanding            
              of radiation chemistry of molecular crystals.
