Abstract    :
              9221651  Potasek  The understanding of solid state devices and their interaction
              with optical fiber components is of importance in both solid-state physics and
              communications.  Electroabsorption modulators made with bulk III-V
              semiconductors or multiple quantum well (MQW) are becoming important devices
              for encoding information in high-speed lightwave systems.    Important issues
              remain to be resolved regarding their operation at high optical power, their
              integration with single-frequency lasers, and the effect of chirp on
              long-distance, high-speed fiber transmission for conventional and soliton
              systems.    A study of the dynamic effects of the saturation of modulators is
              important for future applications of these devices, since most applications
              require the devices to operate at both high speed and high optical intensity.  
               Additionally, we plan to study the effects of high input intensity of the
              modulator chirp since, for the most applications in fiber optic communications
              systems, especially when erbium-doped optical fiber amplifiers are used, it is
              important that the modulator operate with low chirp.  ***
