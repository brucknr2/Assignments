Abstract    :
              This award is the starter grant increment of Dr. Scherer's                     
              Postdoctoral Fellowship in Chemistry. The research will develop                
              two experimental methodologies. One is a general approach to                   
              creating phase-coherent pulse sequences. This will be the first                
              optical analog of NMR pulse sequences. It will be used to                      
              examine the evolution of optical coherence on femtosecond                      
              timescales. The second methodology involves the direct probing                 
              of solvent responses to chemical reactions using new nonlinear                 
              spectroscopies. This involves the measurement of non-resonant                  
              solvent birefringence responses to chemical evolution during                   
              the course of a reaction. The purpose is to establish the                      
              frequencies and types of solvent motion that take place in                     
              dipolar solvation and photodissociation.                                       
              %%%                                                                            
              New methods will be developed for probing the detailed changes                 
              of structure and energy in molecules during reaction. These                    
              studies are important because they provide better understanding                
              of how to control the outcome of chemical reactions. They may                  
              have wide application to health related and commercial chemical                
              reactions.
