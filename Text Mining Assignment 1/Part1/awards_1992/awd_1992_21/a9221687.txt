Abstract    :
              This research project, supported in the Analytical and Surface                 
              Chemistry Program, continues studies of the infrared                           
              spectroscopy of molecules adsorbed on metal surfaces.  Detailed                
              reflection-absorption infrared spectroscopic studies of methyl                 
              thiolate, methoxy, and ethylidyne moieties adsorbed on                         
              silver,copper, and rhodium surfaces will be carried out.  All                  
              of these systems exhibit Fermi resonance effects which couple                  
              the symmetric C-H stretch fundamental with methyl bending                      
              overtones, and serve as excellent models of the important                      
              physical interactions between adsorbate molecules and between                  
              the adsorbate and the surface.  The quantitative understanding                 
              developed in this work will have wide applicablility in the use                
              of infrared spectroscopy to study surface chemistry.

              The widespread use of infrared spectroscopy to study the                       
              mechanisms of surface chemical processes is a method                           
              development which has provided an increased understanding of a                 
              number of important heterogeneous systems.  The goal of this                   
              research project is to develop the detailed knowledge of the                   
              infrared spectroscopy of molecules adsorbed at surfaces which                  
              will enable the continued use of infrared to monitor surface                   
              reactions.  High resolution IR methods provide a wealth of                     
              information, and the results of this research project will be                  
              essential to the development and implementation of these                       
              methods.
