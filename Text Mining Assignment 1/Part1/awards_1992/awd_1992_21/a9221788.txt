Abstract    :
              Predation hazard or intimidation plays an important role in the                
              ecology of freshwater communities by structuring habitat use by                
              member species.  Locally, intimidation may suppress growth and                 
              reproduction, thereby directly affecting the population dynamics               
              of member species.  While intimidation from predators is known to              
              produce local effects, no experimental work has addressed the                  
              important question of how intimidation is expressed on larger                  
              scales; i.e. the scale of whole streams or watersheds on Iotic                 
              systems.  The goal of this proposal is to explore that question in             
              a tropical stream fish community.  We will test the hypothesis that            
              predators, through intimidation and direct killing, can generate               
              observed patterns across a large (geographic) scale, and also a                
              hypothesis that competition is responsible for an observed pattern.            
              We will test specific predictions derived from the hypotheses in               
              controlled experiments in an tropical first- and second-order                  
              experimental stream system, and by conducting a large scale survey             
              of the Paria drainage in the Northern Range Mountains of Trinidad.
