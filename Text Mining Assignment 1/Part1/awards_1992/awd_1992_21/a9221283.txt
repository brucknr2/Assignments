Abstract    :
                   Professor Surko will study the interaction of low-energy                  
              positrons with a variety of molecules in a Penning trap.                       
              Positron interaction with matter is not very well explored and                 
              Professor Surko will examine the nature of recently-discovered                 
              long-lived positron-molecule resonances and their dependence on                
              specific chemical structures in the molecules.
