Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Collaborative Project: Independently Determined Distances to the               
              Magellanic Clouds.                                                             
                                                                                             
              Dr. Moffett, in collaboration with Dr. Thomas Barnes at the                    
              University of Texas, will carry out an observational project to                
              determine distances to the Large and Small Magellanic Clouds by                
              means of the surface brightness technique applied to Cepheid                   
              variable stars.  Existing and new photometric data will be combined            
              with existing high quality radial velocities in a surface                      
              brightness analysis to obtain individual distances and radii for               
              all twenty two extragalactic Cepheids.  These individual distances             
              will establish mean distances to the Magellanic Clouds independent             
              of other astrophysical distance scales and independent of the                  
              interstellar reddening of these Cepheids.
