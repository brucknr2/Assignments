Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              As part of an agreement to provide instrumentation for the 200-inch            
              Hale telescope at Palomar Observatory, Carnegie Observatories has              
              constructed a large-format CCD camera for direct imaging at prime              
              focus.  The instrument, COSMIC, includes a complete mounting base              
              and computer control system.  This award will provide matching                 
              funds to construct the optical and mechanical components of a                  
              spectrograph to be added to the camera.  The spectrograph will be              
              a low to moderate resolution, all transmitting spectrograph with a             
              wide field of view.  One of its primary scientific uses will be to             
              obtain spectra of galaxies at high redshift to study galaxy                    
              evolution.
