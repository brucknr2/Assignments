Abstract    :
                   This award covers experimental Elementary Particle                        
              Physics Research by a group at Cornell University in                           
              collaboration with other NSF and DOE supported scientists.                     
              The group will continue studying very high energy antiproton-                  
              proton scattering at the Fermilab Tevatron Accelerator.  The                   
              proposal includes the construction of a new small angle                        
              particle detector using the emerging scintillating fiber                       
              technology.
