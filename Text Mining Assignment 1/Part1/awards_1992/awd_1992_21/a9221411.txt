Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              A lot of effort in the recent past has been expended on                        
              theoretical development, algorithmic investigation,                            
              computational testing, and chemical engineering design and                     
              science applications of the local optimization algorithms for                  
              nonlinear programming (NLP) and mixed-integer nonlinear                        
              programming (MINLP) problems.  There now exist a number of                     
              local optimization algorithms and their efficient                              
              implementations that are used for small, medium, and large                     
              scale problems.  There has been much less systematic study on                  
              the theoretical developments, algorithmic methodology,                         
              computational testing, and application to chemical engineering                 
              design and science problems of global optimization approaches.                 
              The goal of this research is to develop and apply theoretical,                 
              algorithmic and computational techniques for global                            
              optimization problems (GOP) that arise in a variety of                         
              chemical engineering design and science applications.                          
                                                                                             
              The PI will investigate several classes of global optimization                 
              problems using a primal-relaxed dual global optimization                       
              algorithm.  In particular, he will focus on: (1) new                           
              properties and new formulations of the relaxed dual                            
              subproblems; (2) the design of phase and chemical reaction                     
              equilibrium systems; (3) the process synthesis of separations,                 
              heat recovery networks and reactor systems; (4) bilevel linear                 
              and nonlinear optimization problems arising in process design                  
              and control; (5) optimum structure(s) determination of                         
              clusters of atoms and molecules; and (6) the development of a                  
              parallel primal relaxed dual, GOP, approach.
