Abstract    :
              Deuterium labeled potential biosynthetic precursors will be                    
              prepared for a study of the mechanism of defensive carboxylic acid             
              biosynthesis in carabid beetles.  These precursors will include                
              specifically labeled examples of a number of amino acids, such as              
              L-valine, L-isoleucine, and L-leucine.  Exploratory studies are                
              also planned on the biosynthesis of the azamacrolides and related              
              beetle-produced alkaloids.

              This research on the defensive chemistry of insects should make                
              significant contributions to our understanding of both biosynthesis            
              and chemical diversity.  The phyletic dominance of insects on earth            
              is at least in part related to their "skill" in synthesizing a                 
              variety of highly effective defensive chemicals.  Knowledge of how             
              these chemicals are produced should give insights into insect                  
              chemistry, which may  in turn have practical implications, and also            
              reveal some new aspects of fundamentally important biochemical                 
              mechanisms.
