Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              It has long been postulated that our hominid ancestors underwent               
              critical adaptations to the savanna grasslands of Africa after                 
              leaving the forests, yet the presence of this savanna habitat type             
              throughout hominid evolution has never been clearly established.               
                                                                                             
              This dissertation research project will infer the vegetational                 
              structure of early hominid habitats by determining the feeding                 
              adaptations of contemporaneous herbivores.  The initial stage of               
              analysis will involve the determination of correspondences between             
              cranial and axial morphological variation on the one hand and                  
              specific feeding behaviors among living African antelopes on the               
              other.  This information will then allow for the determination of              
              various fossil bovid dietary preferences, and in turn, the                     
              evaluation of hypotheses concerning the origin and spread of                   
              savanna grasslands.                                                            
                                                                                             
                  The study provides for excellent graduate training for a young             
              professional.
