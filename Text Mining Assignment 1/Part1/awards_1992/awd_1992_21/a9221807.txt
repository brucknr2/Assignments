Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              FSU Marine Data  Management and Research                                       
                                                                                             
              This program is a multi-year dual-emphasis effort between U.S. data            
              centers and laboratories of the states of the former Soviet Union              
              (FSU).  One result of the recent political and economic changes is             
              that large volumes of irreplaceable historical marine environmental            
              data are at serious risk of bring lost to global research programs.            
              Included in these data are long-term observation of high potential             
              value to ocean science programs such as WOCE, JGOFS and other                  
              climate change studies.                                                        
                                                                                             
              The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), through            
              its Environmental Information Services, is working with                        
              counterpart groups of the FSU. Initial program efforts are                     
              emphasizing oceanographic data rescue, quality  control and data               
              intercomparison. Additional collaborative efforts between U.S. and             
              FSU researchers are developing new data access and display                     
              techniques, technical applications in support of joint research                
              efforts, and new information products.                                         
                                                                                             
              This project is part of the US-USSR-(Russia) Agreement on                      
              Cooperation in Ocean Studies.
