Abstract    :
                   The Medical College of Wisconsin (MCW) seeks to provide access            
              to and educational support of the INTERNET to hospitals and clinics            
              throughout the state of Wisconsin, Northern Illinois and the upper             
              peninsula of Michigan.  At present, these non-academic, non-                   
              government agencies have only limited access to some of the                    
              functions Internet provides (i.e., e-mail) through the commercial              
              sector.  MCW is already an Internet node and seeks to enhance its              
              outreach mission by providing access to the Internet's services in             
              order to improve state and regional health professionals' access to            
              information.                                                                   
                   The objectives of the proposal are:                                       
                                                                                             
                   * provide access to the Internet for rural and community                  
              hospitals and clinics                                                          
                   * educate users as to what the Internet is                                
                   * instruct and support users on how best to utilize Internet's            
              services                                                                       
                   * serve as a demonstration project for other regions
