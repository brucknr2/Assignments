Abstract    :
                   Long-term forest dynamics in the hemlock-hardwood forest                  
              mosaic of the USFS Sylvania Wilderness Area, northern Michigan,                
              will be studies using fossil pollen in small forest hollows.                   
              Histories of individual forest stands, recorded in the sediment,               
                                                                                             
              will identify successional communities in the fire-dominated                   
              forest ecosystem before hemlock invasion 3000 years ago, making                
              it possible to see whether disturbances made some areas                        
              particularly invasible, thus influencing hemlock entry and the                 
              locations of hemlock patches that have occupied those sites ever               
                                                                                             
              since.  By dating hemlock arrival at a series of sites in extreme              
                                                                                             
              environments, near bogs or lakes or on coarse soils, we will test              
                                                                                             
              the alternative hypothesis that differences in the physical                    
              environment were responsible for the locations of hemlock                      
              patches.  Fine-scale analyses of sediment and time-series                      
              analyses of the resulting data will explore changes in                         
              successional pathways as the disturbance regime changed from fire              
                                                                                             
              to wind 3000 years ago.  Modeling will be used to investigate the              
                                                                                             
              dynamic changes that have occurred in the positions of boundaries              
                                                                                             
              between stands in the forest mosaic.  The results will be useful               
                                                                                             
              for demonstrating the response of forest communities to climate,               
                                                                                             
              including changes in disturbance regimes which may accompany                   
              Global Warming.  Understanding the origin of the mosaic pattern                
              of forest communities on the landscape may help forest mangers to              
                                                                                             
              preserve this aspect of the biodiversity of old-growth forest                  
              stands.
