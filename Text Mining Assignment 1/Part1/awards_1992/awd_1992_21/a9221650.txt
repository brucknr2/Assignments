Abstract    :
                      The Department  of Chemistry at  Columbia University                   
              is requesting  funds for the  upgrade of their  departmental                   
              computing facilities. The  present departmental machines are                   
              a Convex  C210 and  a Vax   Cluster, both  of which  are now                   
              hopelessly outdated with regard  to computational power. The                   
              system proposed here will  increase CPU capabilities by more                   
              than   an  order   of  magnitude,   thus  facilitating  both                   
              theoretical  and  experimental   research  in  computational                   
              chemistry. The  proposal is based  on a workstation  farm in                   
              operation at  the Thomas J. Watson  Research Laboratories of                   
              IBM that has provided a stable computing environment for the                   
              past 1.5 years. The most important feature of a farm is that                   
              it can simultaneously  satisfy departmental computing needs,                   
              serve as a development environment for new theoretical codes                   
              and  algorithms,  provide  state  of  the  art  graphics and                   
              visualization  facilities and  support research  in state of                   
              the art  applications of parallel processing  for the entire                   
              department.  Work  which  will  be  supported  with this new                   
              computing facility includes:                                                   
                                                                                             
              1) Molecular dynamics and Monte Carlo algorithms for quantum                   
              and classical systems;                                                         
                                                                                             
              2)  New algorithms  for quantum  chemistry, quantum dynamics                   
              and molecular spectroscopy;                                                    
                                                                                             
              3)  High performance  parallel free  energy perturbation and                   
              conformational searching;

              %%%                                                                            
                      A   workstation  farm   of  fast,   modern  computer                   
              workstations is a new way  to satisfy the computing needs of                   
              chemistry departments. Such a "computer farm" also serves as                   
              a development  environment  for  new  theoretical  codes and                   
              algorithms,    provides   state-of-the-art    graphics   and                   
              visualization   facilities   and    supports   research   in                   
              state-of-the-art applications of parallel processing.
