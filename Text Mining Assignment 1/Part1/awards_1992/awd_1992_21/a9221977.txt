Abstract    :
              The construction industry in the United States is highly                       
              fragmented.  An example is the partitioning of work phases among               
              multiple entities in the design, fabrication, and erection of                  
              structural steel.  Division of the design, detailing, and                      
              construction phases results in a lack of communication of                      
              engineering information crucial to providing the optimal total                 
              product.  The objective of this research is to improve the                     
              quality of steel structures by improving communication between                 
              the designer and the fabricator and improving the use of design                
              information by both parties.  This will be achieved through an                 
              integration of knowledge-based expert systems (KBES) with                      
              computer-aided design and drafting (CADD).  Such a computer                    
              system, using a standard format for data, facilitates the                      
              managing and transferring of design information between the                    
              designer and fabricator and enables the use of that data for                   
              improved design decision making.  A prototype system will be                   
              developed, evaluated and verified using real design cases,                     
              refined using feedback from both fabricators and designers,                    
              tested in small trials by potential users, and evaluated and                   
              documented to expedite transfer to industry use.  This will                    
              produce a tool to significantly improve the efficiency and                     
              effectiveness of the steel industry.//
