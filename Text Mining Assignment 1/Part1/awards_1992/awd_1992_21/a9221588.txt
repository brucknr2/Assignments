Abstract    :
                   The University of Portland is establishing a connection to                
              NSFNET via a  56,000 bits per second line through the NorthWestNet             
              mid-level network.  The connection enables the school's faculty and            
              students to communicate and collaborate with the international                 
              scientific and educational community, and to access network                    
              resources such as libraries, databases and supercomputers.  This               
              award funds part of the costs for two years.
