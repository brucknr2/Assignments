Abstract    :
              This grant is to assist in the support of an international                     
              boundary element symposium (IABEM-92, International Symposium on               
              Boundary Element Methods) to be held August 3-6, 1992, at the                  
              University of Colorado at Boulder.  The aim of the symposium is                
              to appraise the state-of-the-art and set directions for new                    
              research in the field of boundary element methods, especially for              
              large-scale analysis.  It will facilitate a dialogue between                   
              engineers and scientists working in a variety of technological                 
              fields that employ boundary element methods.  The conference will              
              result in an authoritative high quality proceedings volume, based              
              on selected symposium papers, which will serve as a basic                      
              reference on this subject.
