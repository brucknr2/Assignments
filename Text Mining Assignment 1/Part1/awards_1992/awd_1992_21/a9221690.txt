Abstract    :
                   Massachusetts Institute of Technology requests support from               
              NSF for connection of Berklee College of Music, College of Our Lady            
              of the Elms, Rhode Island School of Design, Saint Michael's                    
              College, and the State of Connecticut Board of Trustees of                     
              Community Technical Colleges to the New England Academic Research              
              Network (NEARnet) which is the NSF mid-level network that serves               
              the New England area.  A primary goal of NEARnet is to facilitate              
              collaborative projects and sharing of resources between                        
              institution, including those outside the state.                                
                   NEARnet will provide operations management and information                
              services and it will give the universities and colleges a                      
              connection to the NSFNET, a high speed (1.5 - 45 million bits per              
              second) National Backbone network.                                             
                   The each of the universities has written a description of its             
              organization and a statement of the benefits of Internet access                
              that it expects including:  greater functionality and network speed            
              to be able to access supercomputers, libraries, and make file                  
              transfers along with being able to implement a more reliable mail              
              system.  Students and faculty research will benefit from the links.            
              This is also a unique opportunity for the schools to explore                   
              innovative educational resources.  Their diversity will expose                 
              NEARnet to a broader range of user requirements.  Nearnet will use             
              the information obtained by serving this diverse group for the                 
              benefit of New England's academic and research community.
