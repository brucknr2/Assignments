Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The process by which interstellar gas gathers into stars is a                  
              fundamental problem in astrophysics, with implications for the                 
              formation and evolution of galaxies and the formation of the                   
              elements.  The structure and evolution of molecular clouds, the                
              sites of Galactic star formation, will be investigated by Dr.                  
              McKee.  Molecular clouds are observed to be highly clumped, and                
              calculations will determine the nature of the medium between the               
              clumps.  The early evolution of a molecular cloud, in which a                  
              largely atomic gas becomes molecular, will be calculated.  The                 
              distribution of pressure in gravitationally bound clumps will be               
              investigated.  Calculations will trace the destruction of the                  
              clouds by the massive stars that form within them.  Shock waves                
              shape the mass spectrum of  diffuse interstellar clouds, and                   
              powerful hydrodynamic and magnetohydrodynamic computer codes will              
              be used to study the interaction of shocks with clouds.  Shock                 
              waves can produce water masers, which are signposts of massive star            
              formation, and the conditions under which this can occur will be               
              evaluated.  Many of the heavy elements of the interstellar medium,             
              which are produced by stars, are locked up in tiny dust grains; the            
              sputtering, vaporization, and shattering of these grains in                    
              interstellar shocks will be calculated.
