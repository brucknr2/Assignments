              This project builds on prior NSF-supported research on the                     
              linguistic phenomenon of "unaccusativity", which involves a split              
              among intransitive verbs into the unaccusative verbs, whose                    
              surface subject is an underlying object, and the unergative                    
              verbs, whose surface subject is an underlying subject. The                     
              investigation will now address two theoretical issues that                     
              surfaced in this work, both involving the proper lexical                       
              representation of verbs. They are: (1) meaning shifts, a                       
              phenomenon in which verbs regularly show several meanings, and                 
              (2) the identification of the basic number of arguments of a                   
              verb--its "acidity". Intransitive verbs are again the research                 
              domain. The results of these explorations will further deepen our              
              understanding of unaccusativity. The focus will be on one                      
              manifestation of the important question of the "non-uniformity"                
              of unaccusativity: if unaccusativity is syntactically                          
              represented, why is there a split among the uncontroversially                  
              unaccusative verbs, a syntactically-defined class? Since the                   
              split is reflected in behavior with respect to meaning shifts and              
              adicity, the investigation of these issues will be brought to                  
              bear on explaining the non-uniformity of unaccusativity.
