Abstract    :
              The structure, phase behavior, and protein stability of membrane-              
              associated proteins complexed with associating polymers which                  
              replace the lipid matrix will be investigated by x-ray diffraction             
              and other techniques.  The polymer-membrane protein associations               
              represent a fundamentally new approach aimed at producing a new                
              class of biomolecular materials.  The first membrane-associated                
              proteins to be studied are based on (i) integral memebrane proteins            
              (e.g., bacteriorhodopsin) and (ii) self-assembled two-dimensional              
              surface protein layers of bacteria.  The two classes of associating            
              polymers which we propose to consider consist of (i)                           
              hydrophobically associating copolymers, and (ii) ionomers.
