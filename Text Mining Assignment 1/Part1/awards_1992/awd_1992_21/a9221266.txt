Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The use of plant medicines by contemporary people of Hawaii                    
              is commonplace, even among urban populations and in a state                    
              which offers one of the most liberal access to biomedical                      
              health care in the US.  Especially for Native Hawaiians,                       
              health care professionals express concern that access to                       
              these alternative medicines delays seeking attention from                      
              practitioners of biomedicines, which compromises the                           
              efficacy of such therapy, and that plant medicines are used                    
              in conjunction with or to the exclusion of pharmaceuticals,                    
              thereby setting into motion physiochemical actions that                        
              might be contrary to the outcome of pharmaceutical therapy                     
              alone.                                                                         
                                                                                             
              The primary objective of this research is to investigate the                   
              use of plant medicines from a biobehavioral perspective that                   
              explores the cultural constructions of "folk" preventive and                   
              therapeutic strategies and links that to pharmacologic                         
              assessments of medicinal plants.  The principal concern is                     
              how preventive and therapeutic  strategies affect the                          
              physiological health of Native Hawaiians.  The plants                          
              isolated for attention will meet two criteria that increase                    
              the likelihood that they have a significant impact on                          
              health: 1) plants that enjoy wide currency - used most                         
              commonly by people and/or for more conditions; 2) plants                       
              most likely to compete directly with pharmaceuticals and                       
              other forms of biomedical care or to delay biomedical                          
              treatment.
