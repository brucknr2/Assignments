Abstract    :
              This work focuses on the protein/protein and DNA protein                       
              interactions that are required for regulation of colanic acid                  
              polysaccharide capsule expression in Escherichia coli.  These                  
              interactions are incorporated into a model that will be tested.                
              The first two sections of this work examine the protein/protein                
              interactions of three of the capsule synthesis regulators: Rcs,                
              RcsB, and RcsC.  These interactions will be examined by genetic and            
              biochemical analyses.  The third section is designed to elucidate              
              the protein/DNA interactions that are required at the promoter of              
              the capsule genes.  Molecular genetic methods will be used for                 
              these studies.                                                                 
              %%%                                                                            
              Polysaccharide capsules are often expressed only under certain                 
              adverse conditions which allows the bacteria producing them to                 
              survive better in a natural environment.  Because the synthesis                
              levels of capsules vary with the environment, it is important to               
              understand how their regulatory networks control capsule                       
              production. The regulatory network for colanic acid is a model                 
              for the control of synthesis of several other capsule regulatory               
              networks will lead to a greater understanding of how the                       
              environment affects the production of these survival factors.
