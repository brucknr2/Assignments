Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This grant investigates micromechanical deformation using atomic               
              force microscopy, continuous indentation testing, and impression               
              creep analysis.   These techniques are applied to several materials            
              systems (bucky balls, amorphous metals, polymers) to develop new               
              tools for micromechanical testing applicable to thin films.                    
              Nanoindentation experiments are planned using the atomic force                 
              microscope and its associated small indenter.  Shear bands are                 
              examined in polymers and amorphous metals.  Theoretical support                
              includes consideration of the molecular dynamics of the interaction            
              between bucky balls, finite element analysis of continuous loading             
              and unloading with an indenter, and diffusional creep at aluminum              
              grain boundaries.                                                              
              %%%                                                                            
              The results impact the area of micromechanical measurement of thin             
              films and small particles.  Crack nucleation, erosion, and                     
              localized deformation are examples of microdeformation phenomena               
              that would benefit from improved analysis techniques.
