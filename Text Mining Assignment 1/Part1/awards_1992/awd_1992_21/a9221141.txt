Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              A collaborative interdisciplinary materials research program on                
              dilute magnetic semiconductors (DMS) and magnetic semiconductors is            
              proposed.  This program involves a unique combination of high                  
              magnetic fields, low temperatures, advanced optical techniques, and            
              new materials development in order to study the microscopic                    
              interactions of magnetic ions in a host semiconductor.  The                    
              organizations involved are:  the MIT National Magnet Laboratory                
              (NML), the Physics Department at Tufts, and the Chemistry                      
              Department at Brown University.  The plan is to study the magnetic,            
              optical, and electric-transport properties, as well as the crystal             
              chemistry of several classes of dilute magnetic semiconducting                 
              materials.                                                                     
                                                                                             
              This grant supports the effort at Brown University.
