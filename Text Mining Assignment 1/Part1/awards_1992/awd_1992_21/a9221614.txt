Abstract    :
                   In many coastal species, a critical platonic larval                       
              stage is spent in the waters of the inner continental shelf,                   
              the most shoreward few kilometers of the shelf where depths                    
              are typically less than 30 m.  Our knowledge of the                            
              parameters of the shelf where these planktonic larvae live                     
              is meager.  Physical processes which strongly influence the                    
              biology, such as sediment transport and the stratification                     
              and circulation of inner shelf waters, are poorly                              
              understood.  A major goal of this study is to obtain                           
              synoptic, moored, long-term measurements of biological,                        
              physical and sediment transport parameters at the same time                    
              and space scales.  The field program is aimed at gaining                       
              insight into the processes that may control the successful                     
              dispersal and settlement of planktonic larvae of organisms                     
              living in near-shore sandy sediments.  The study is designed                   
              so that critical disciplinary, as well as interdisciplinary                    
              questions can be addressed.  The basic hypothesis guiding                      
              the research is that planktonic larvae of organisms living                     
              in the intertidal zone (or in very shallow water) exploit                      
              the circulation of the inner shelf to control their cross-                     
              shelf transport.
