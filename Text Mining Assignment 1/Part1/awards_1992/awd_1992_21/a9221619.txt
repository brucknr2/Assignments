Abstract    :
              9221619  LIN    This is a three year cooperative study proposed  by Dr.
              Chii-Dong Lin, Kansas State University,  and Dr. Shih-I Chu, University of
              Kansas and  Professor Tsin-Fu Jiang, National Chiao Tung  University, and
              Professor Sy-Sang Liaw,  National Chung-Hsing University.  The project  is
              supported under the AIT (U.S.)-CCNAA  (Taiwan) Cooperative Science Program. 
              This  proposal plans to conduct studies of atomic and  molecular dynamics under
              excited states and in  strong fields. Both Dr. Lin and Dr. Chu are  leading
              theorists in atomic and molecular  physics.  Dr. Lin plans to conduct
              experiments  on doubly excited states within the  non-relativistic framework. 
              Dr. Chu proposes  to study atoms and molecular dynamics in  intense fields. 
              These two studies are loosely  connected, but each has strong scientific 
              merit.  The project provides an opportunity for  U.S. researchers to expand
              their available  resources and equipment in Taiwan for  conducting this study,
              while they  learn the critical numerical method from their  Taiwan
              collaborating group.  ***
