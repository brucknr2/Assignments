Abstract    :
              9221500  Udwadia  This award supports ten U.S. engineers to participate in a
              U.S.-European   workshop on dynamics and control of  nonlinear uncertain
              systems.  The small   meeting will be held in Vienna, Austria, in July 1993. 
              It is co-organized by a   group of  U.S. and Austrian engineers, principally
              Drs. F. E. Udwadia of USC   and Hans Troger of the Technical University of
              Vienna.   Approximately one-  third of the participants are engineers at early
              stages of their research careers.    Special effort was taken to involve
              experts from Russia and Eastern Europe,   since there is substantial activity
              there in this field.  The purposes of the   meeting are to familiarize these
              participating representatives of the  pan-  European and American research
              communities with each other's work, and to   promote collaboration among them
              in future research.    The subject of this workshop has significant
              implications for manufacturing   systems.  Rapid development of technology
              requires increased precision and   robustness in mathematical modelling of the
              relevant phenomena.  This   requires going beyond the methods of Classical
              Control Theory and advancing   the frontiers of Analytic and Qualitative
              Nonlinear Dynamics in Control.    Effective design and control of modern
              dynamical systems, such as robotic   manipulators, demand models that recognize
              their full non linearity and allow   for the influence of bounded uncertainty. 
              A formalism developed by the   Russian Liapunov offers just that.  There is a
              very strong Eastern European   network of researchers building on his work. 
              They had very little contact with   the West until very recently, so this
              meeting will accelerate the diffusion of   their valuable research in Western
              Europe and the U.S.  ***
