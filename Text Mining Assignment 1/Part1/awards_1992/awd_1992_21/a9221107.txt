Abstract    :
                   This research addresses the question of whether the ability               
              of a plant to develop leaves with different morphology and                     
              physiology in response to different growth temperatures promotes               
              survival and/or increased seed production.  I will conduct                     
              experiments under natural conditions and in controlled                         
              environments to compare the anatomy, morphology, and physiology                
              of leaves that develop at different temperatures.  I will then                 
              determine whether plants that are better at changing leaf                      
              characteristics in response to temperature changes survive better              
              and/or produce more seeds.  The extent to which the ability to                 
              change leaf characteristics in response to temperature is a                    
              genetically determined trait that can be inherited will also be                
              determined.                                                                    
                   The results of this research will contribute to our basic                 
              understanding of how  organisms respond to changes in their                    
              environment.  This understanding, in turn, may help in predicting              
              the effects of natural disturbances and human impacts on the                   
              environment on plants and animals.
