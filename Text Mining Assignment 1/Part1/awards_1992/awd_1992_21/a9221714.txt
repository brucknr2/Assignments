Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This project is designed to enlarge the support for student                    
              training in ethnography.  The Department of Anthropology at the                
              University of Georgia has developed a program focussed on                      
              sustainable human ecosystems (or SHEP).  This program involves                 
              rigorous training in research design, statistics, and                          
              ethnographic method.  through funding of this project, part of                 
              this program of education will include an important field                      
              component of ethnographic training.  Students under the                        
              supervision of faculty will enter the field at a faculty research              
              site and apply research techniques learned in the classroom to                 
              actual field research.  The field experience will last a  minimum              
              of 10 weeks and will greatly enhance the quality of graduate                   
              training and allow students to better design their doctoral                    
              research.
