Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  This project will examine the determinants of dental variation            
              in the Asian Colobinae, a large subfamily of primates not studied              
              in any depth to date.  In addition to providing the first                      
              comprehensive data set on all the extant Asian species of this                 
              subfamily, it will contribute to knowledge of a primate                        
              evolutionary radiation, addressing one way in which closely related            
              species coexist.  The relationship of dental variation to differing            
              diets and ecologies will be tested, as well as phylogenetic                    
              correspondence.                                                                
                                                                                             
                   Besides being important in its scientific goals, this project             
              will also improve the technical and investigative abilities of an              
              excellent young scientist.
