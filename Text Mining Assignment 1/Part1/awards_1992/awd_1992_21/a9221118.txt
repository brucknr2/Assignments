Abstract    :
              This award, made in the Advanced Materials and Processing                      
              Program, extends support for the research of Murray and                        
              coworkers on the design, characterization and electronic                       
              properties of thin molecular films. The goals of the research                  
              are to (1) study the electrochemical formation of ultrathin                    
              dielectric and conductive films with discrete electron-hopping                 
              sites by in-situ atomic force microscopy (AFM) and                             
              ellipsometry; (2) Prepare nanostructures by using the AFM tip                  
              to create patterned holes  in the films and to re-deposit other                
              thin film materials in the holes, and (3) study transport                      
              properties of mixed valent molecular films which lack ionic                    
              conductivity by measuring the Hall effect and                                  
              magnetoresistance. Assemblies of the films will be utilized in                 
              electron and hole-injecting contacts, rectifying molecular                     
              junctions, thin film transistors and molecular light emitting                  
              devices.                                                                       
              %%%                                                                            
              This highly interdisciplinary research will explore the                        
              underlying fundamental chemistry of thin film synthesis and                    
              characterization, develop new technology for producing                         
              nanostructures and advance the understanding of the physics of                 
              devices where charge transport is controlled by                                
              electron-hopping.
