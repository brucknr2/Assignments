Abstract    :
              In this project the PI's will complete the analysis and                        
              interpretation of hydrographic, current meter Acoustic Doppler                 
              Current Profiler, and satellite data acquired during a field                   
              experiment near Barbados.  The immediate objective is to quantify              
              the effects of island wakes on the coastal circulation around the              
              island.  Longer term objectives include the relationship between               
              the circulation and larval reef fish dispersion, retention, and                
              recruitment.
