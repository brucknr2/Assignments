Abstract    :
                   This project will develop a strategy to support the use of                
              the Internet by public libraries in support of national science                
              education and literacy goals.  The workshop will bring together                
              representatives of the library, regional NSFNET networks, and                  
              library network communities to explore the use of the Internet as              
              a tool by public libraries.  Alternative collaborative models                  
              will be identified.                                                            
                   Information to guide public libraries will be developed as                
              well recommended action for all parties concerned.                             
                   The final report and recommendations will be widely                       
              disseminated to be used by public libraries to plan their                      
              individual strategies for connection to the NSFNET and ultimately              
              take place as major player in the evolving plan for the National               
              Research and Education Network (NREN).
