Abstract    :
                   This award supports mathematical research in the areas of                 
              partial differential equations and functional differential                     
              equations. The work focuses on the applications of infinite                    
              dimensional nonlinear programming theory to optimal control                    
              problems for systems governed by equations such as the                         
              Navier-Stokes equations, reaction-diffusion equations and                      
              nonlinear wave equations.  The object is to obtain existence                   
              results in the realm of relaxed controls, necessary conditions                 
              for optimal controls of the type of Pontryagin's maximum                       
              principle, convergence results for numerically obtained sequences              
              of suboptimal controls and feedback solutions by means of                      
              Hamilton-Jacoby equations.  Work will be done both in the case of              
              distributed and boundary control for problems that include sate                
              constraints.  Regularization of problems containing singular arcs              
              and the role of the Hamiltonian in free arrival time problems                  
              will also be examined.                                                         
                   Partial differential equations form a basis for mathematical              
              modeling of the physical world.  The role of mathematical                      
              analysis is not so much to create the equations as it is to                    
              provide qualitative and quantitative information about the                     
              solutions.  This may include answers to questions about                        
              uniqueness, smoothness and growth.  In addition, analysis often                
              develops methods for approximation of solutions and estimates on               
              the accuracy of these approximations.
