Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This Americas Program award will support a                                     
              joint research between Dr. Richard S. Dodd, of                                 
              the University of California, Berkeley, Forest                                 
              Products Laboratory and Dr. Claudio Donoso, of                                 
              the Universidad Austral de Chile.  This                                        
              research will study the population genetic                                     
              variability and systematics of three Chilean                                   
              conifers. The researchers will collect                                         
              population samples of the three different                                      
              genera and use isozyme comparisons for the                                     
              assessment of genetic diversity in and among                                   
              natural populations.  They will also document                                  
              patterns of variations for morphological traits                                
              and use terpenoid profiles in providing a                                      
              framework for future genetic studies of these                                  
              organisms.                                                                     
                                                                                             
              As a result of the world-wide growing demand                                   
              for timber, the integrity of forest ecosystems                                 
              is seriously threatened.  This study will                                      
              generate preliminary data that would provide                                   
              the background for preparing a comprehensive                                   
              taxonomic assessment of the genera and provide                                 
              information useful for conservation and                                        
              sustainable management of these timber                                         
              resources.  The complementary expertise of the                                 
              investigators in both the techniques to be                                     
              utilized and the biology and natural                                           
              distribution of the plants is an assurance that                                
              the project will achieve its goals.
