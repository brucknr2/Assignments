Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              With National Science Foundation support, Dr. Thomas Hester and                
              his colleagues will conduct archaeological excavation at the site              
              of Cobweb Swamp, Belize. In 1987, during the course of survey and              
              test pitting in the area surrounding the known Mayan site of                   
              Colha, Dr. Hester discovered highly paginated stone artifacts                  
              which stratigraphically underlay Mayan artifacts. Additional                   
              excavation in 1991 yielded materials radiocarbon dated to 2500 to              
              1400 BC. This predates the earliest known Mayan presence in the                
              region. Dr. Hester and colleagues will now return to the site and              
              excavate a large 4x6 meter block as well as smaller 2x2 meter                  
              test excavations. He hopes to recover abundant lithic as well as               
              floral and faunal remains and on this basis both describe this                 
              pre-Mayan culture and determine its relationship to later Mayan                
              occupation of the region. He will also obtain material for                     
              additional radiocarbon dating, collect pollen to reconstruct                   
              environment, and attempt to determine how this changed over time.              
                                                                                             
              The origins of the Mayan peoples who inhabited lowland Middle                  
              America are not known. In Belize the earliest Mayan site dates to              
              about 1200 BC and by that time the roots of Mayan civilization                 
              has been established. Archaeological data from earlier periods                 
              exists, but it is minimal and does not come from                               
              stratigraphically secure, well dated contexts. Cobweb Swamp                    
              however is different and is important for this reason. It is                   
              unclear whether Mayan culture emerged from this earlier pre-                   
              ceramic context or if Mayan peoples entered the region from                    
              elsewhere. The question is important because it bears on our                   
              understanding of how complex culture developed in heavily                      
              forested tropical environments.                                                
                                                                                             
              This research is significant for several reasons. It will                      
              increase our understanding of how complex societies arise and                  
              will provide data of interest to many archaeologists.
