Abstract    :
              Meiosis is a complex cellular process that occurs during the sexual            
              reproduction of all eukayotic organisms including man.  The                    
              reproduction of meiosis involves the assembly of complex cellular              
              structures, including the synaptonemal complex, and the spindle.               
              We are studying two genes required for normal meiosis in                       
              Drosophila: (1) c(3)G, which is required for the assembly of the               
              synaptonemal complex, and (2) cand, which encodes a kinesin-like               
              mechanochemical protein that is required for the assembly of the               
              spindle.  We have refined the cytogenetic localization of c(3)G in             
              order to facilitate the isolation of the gene by molecular cloning.            
              We now propose to isolate the c(3)G locus by chromosome walking,               
              and use the cloned gene to determine the nature and subcellular                
              localization of the gene product by DNA sequencing and antibody                
              staining.  We also propose to identify additional genes required               
              for synaptonemal complex and spindle assembly by screening for                 
              mutations that display second-site noncomplementation of c(3)G or              
              cand.                                                                          
              %%%                                                                            
              Gametes are formed in sexually reproducing organisms by an                     
              intricate sequence of two cell division known as meiosis.  During              
              meiosis special structures are formed in the dividing reproductive             
              cells which ensure that a precise and compete set of chromosome is             
              distributed into each gamete.  The cellular structures and                     
              mechanisms of meiosis are essential for normal reproduction, since             
              gametes carrying too many or too few chromosomes give rise to                  
              grossly abnormal or inviable offspring.  The detailed mechanisms of            
              meiosis are yet poorly understood.  This is a proposal to study                
              genes of the fruit fly Drosophila whose products play an essential             
              role in meiosis.
