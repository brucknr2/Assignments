Abstract    :
              9221630  O'Brien      A model is to be developed to predict the transport of a 
              scalar property (either chemical species or heat) in a  compressible fluid
              which is turbulent.  The model is based on  the Eddy Damped Quasi Normal model
              which has been developed  for incompressible turbulence, that is, without
              significant  density fluctuations.  These are not to be included by 
              generalizing the model.  A parallel effort will be the  development of a Direct
              Numerical Simulation scheme to be used  to calibrate and validate the new
              model.  Compressibility  effects will be moderate, the intended regime being up
              to a  Mach number of about 0.70.    Compressible turbulence, and transport by
              such turbulence, is  important in high speed reaching flows.  Typical model 
              application would be to combustion and propulsion systems.  ***
