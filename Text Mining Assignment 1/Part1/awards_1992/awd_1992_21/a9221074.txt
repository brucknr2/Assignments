Abstract    :
                   Mangrove forest habitats are highly productive ecosystems                 
              that have significant ecological, economic, and aesthetic value.               
              They are being degraded and destroyed world-wide by                            
              human-induced, local and global alterations of the coastal                     
              environment. Given the broad geographic distribution of                        
              mangroves, there have been surprisingly few studies of canopy                  
              tree regeneration and the interplay of tree life histories with                
              this process. This study will investigate patterns and mechanisms              
              of canopy tree regeneration in a Caribbean mangrove forest, with               
              an emphasis on the role of disturbance-generated canopy gaps. The              
              study will identify the factors that control forest regeneration               
              and thereby shed light on important basic ecological questions                 
              concerning the relative roles of niche partitioning versus                     
              lottery processes in structuring plant assemblages. In addition,               
              the information gathered in this study is essential for                        
              predicting the consequences of different kinds of habitat                      
              alteration. In particular, this study will investigate the                     
              interactions of tree species life histories with seed dispersal,               
              soil nutrient levels, disturbance, herbivory, and interspecific                
              interactions.                                                                  
              %%%                                                                            
              This study represents an important contribution to the                         
              understanding of processes and mechanisms associated with the                  
              dynamics of tropical mangrove forests. Despite the broad                       
              geographic distribution of mangrove vegetation, there has been a               
              paucity of studies on the natural disturbance regime and dynamics              
              of this important type of coastal vegetation. The research                     
              protocol described in this proposal contains one of the most                   
              comprehensive attempts to measure pattern and experimentally                   
              address processes in the regeneration of tropical mangrove                     
              forests.
