Abstract    :
              9221697  Sih    Drs. Sih and Krupa will use a blend of surveys in natural 
              streams and experiments in semi-natural streams to examine  the effects of
              important ecological factors (e.g., predation  risk, food availability,
              population density, and sex ratio)  and individual traits (e.g., size, hunger
              level) on mating  behaviors that determine variation in reproductive success. 
              Their study animal is a semi-aquatic insect that is ideal  for addressing these
              issues, because it is very easy to  mark, observe, census, and experimentally
              manipulate.    This research should yield important insights about how 
              variation in ecological factors influences the evolution of  animal behaviors. 
              The resulting behaviors, in turn, have  major impacts on population success. 
              The work should thus  contribute significantly to theoretical understanding of
              the  interface between evolution, behavior, and ecology.  This  research should
              also have practical importance in providing  new insights into how
              environmental disturbances might have  unexpected effects on species' success
              through effects on  reproductive dynamics.
