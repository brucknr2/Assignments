Abstract    :
              This award is the starter grant increment of Dr. McCarley's                    
              Postdoctoral Fellowship in Chemistry. Scanning tunneling (STM)                 
              and atomic force (ATM) microscopy studies will be carried out                  
              on thin metal films formed upon organic monolayers containing                  
              pendant metal binding sites. Surface diffusion of adatoms                      
              should be controllable by varying the tail group thus allowing                 
              better control over metal film properties. ATM and STM will be                 
              used to monitor the morphology of metals formed on these                       
              modified surfaces. Metal films produced by vacuum evaporation                  
              will be investigated in order to note differences in nucleation                
              events.

              This research will study methods which can lead to the                         
              preparation of thin metal films. These materials are of                        
              considerable commercial importance to the electronics industry.
