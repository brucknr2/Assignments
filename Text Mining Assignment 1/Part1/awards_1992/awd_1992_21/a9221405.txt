Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Collaborative Project: Independently Determined Distances to the               
              Magellanic Clouds.                                                             
                                                                                             
              Dr. Barnes, in collaboration with Dr. Thomas Moffett at Purdue                 
              University, will carry out an observational project to determine               
              distances to the Large and Small Magellanic Clouds by means of the             
              surface brightness technique applied to Cepheid variable stars.                
              Existing and new photometric data will be combined with existing               
              high quality radial velocities in a surface brightness analysis to             
              obtain individual distances and radii for all twenty two                       
              extragalactic Cepheids.  These individual distances will establish             
              mean distances to the Magellanic Clouds independent of other                   
              astrophysical distance scales and independent of the interstellar              
              reddening of these Cepheids.
