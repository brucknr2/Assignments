Abstract    :
              9221836  Dibb  This two objectives of this project are to develop a rugged, 
              portable gamma ray detector system that can be used to make rapid  in situ
              measurements of Cesium-137 in snow and ice, and to test the  system in
              Antarctica in conjunction with other ice coring and snow  sampling programs to
              verify and calibrate the in situ measurements.   These measurements will
              provide an accurate means of determining  the snow accumulation rate, a
              critical component of glaciological  mass balance studies.    The
              identification of horizon markers of known absolute age is  basic to such
              studies.  On the century time scale, the deposition  of Cesium-137 has produced
              horizons at the time of the initiation  of atmospheric thermonuclear testing in
              1953, at the time of  maximum testing in 1963, and the Chernobyl accident in
              1986.   Cesium-137 has a half life of 30.2 years.    This gamma ray detection
              technique is expected to locate horizons  quickly and unambiguously in the
              field, and can be used both in  polar ice sheets, and in high altitude
              temperate zone snow fields.  ***
