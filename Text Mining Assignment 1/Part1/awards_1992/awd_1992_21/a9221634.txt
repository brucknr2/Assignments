Abstract    :
              The goal  of the project is to develop accurate and                            
              easy to use seismic hazard forecast models utilizing                           
              the neural network approach.                                                   
                                                                                             
              The neural network is a very versatile and efficient                           
              approach.  The main advantages of using the neural                             
              network approach in this project are that (1) it is                            
              not necessary to predecide about the mathematical                              
              form for the model in this approach, (2) it can                                
              include a large number of variables without unduly                             
              increasing the computational effort and (3) it can                             
              easily update and improve the model as more data                               
              becomes available.  It is proposed to develop                                  
              models to predict the spatial distribution of                                  
              Modified Mercelli Intensity for the western, mid-                              
              western and eastern United States.  Also the models                            
              to predict the ground motion parameters such as                                
              peak ground acceleration and response spectra will                             
              be developed for the western United States.                                    
                                                                                             
              The proposed study will be conducted over a period                             
              of two years.  During the first year, data collection,                         
              processing, and model formulation will be                                      
              undertaken and generic models for each of the three                            
              regions of the country will be formulated.  The                                
              second year will be devoted to rigorous testing and                            
              fine-tuning of the models.  Sensitivity studies will                           
              be performed to identify the important input                                   
              variables..  Comparison with conventional seismic                              
              hazard/risk analysis models will be made to                                    
              evaluate the performance of the proposed models.                               
              Finally, application computer softwares will be                                
              developed for public dissemination.
