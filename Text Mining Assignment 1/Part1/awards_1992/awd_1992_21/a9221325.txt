Abstract    :
              This award is for support of a study of late Neogene foraminifera              
              and molluscs from Dry Valleys glaciomarine sediment.  Oxygen,                  
              carbon, and strontium isotopes will be measured on foraminifera                
              from the thick glaciomarine sequences in Eastern Taylor Valley, and            
              molluscs from the Prospect Mesa gravels in central Wright Valley.              
              The principal result will be a well-dated history of the                       
              temperature and salinity for late Neogene fjords in Taylor and                 
              Wright Valleys.  Because fjord inflow comes from the Ross Sea, this            
              history reflects that of the  principal water mass in the Ross Sea             
              which is stamped with the climate of the Ross Sea region.  This is             
              a collaborative proposal between Prentice at the University of                 
              Maine, Ishman of the U.S. Geological Survey, and Berkman at The                
              Ohio State University.
