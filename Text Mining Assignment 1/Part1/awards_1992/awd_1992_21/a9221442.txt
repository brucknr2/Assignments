Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  This project examines contract farming arrangements in the                
              Sao Francisco Valley of northeast Brazil,  It addresses the                    
              question of when, where, why and how fruit and vegetable firms                 
              seek to institute contract farming, why and how farming families               
              become involved in them, and the outcomes for both families                    
              and firms.  It tests a series of hypotheses derived from existing              
              literature and from a preliminary field visit, about the causes                
              and consequences of contract farming.  Some of these hypotheses                
              are about the logic of contract farming arrangements for firms:                
              they examine the relationships between contracting and labor                   
              intensity of the production process, the destination of crops for              
              processing, and former firm experience in sharecropping.  Other                
              hypotheses are about the impact of contract farming on the                     
              families involved.  Structured interviews with a sample of                     
              contract farming families and of wage-dependent families will be               
              used to test the hypothesis that contract farming provides higher              
              incomes and more stable incomes; that it decreases the range of                
              income-generating auxiliary activities that family members                     
              perform; and that success of contract farming is correlated with               
              greater availability of labor resources.  In-depth interviews                  
              with firm managers, and with contract farming families will                    
              provide additional data for interpretation and cross-checking of               
              statistical results.
