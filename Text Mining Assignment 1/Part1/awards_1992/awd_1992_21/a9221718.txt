Abstract    :
                   Professor Xiao will start a program of experiment and theory              
              investigating the quantum properties of nonclassical                           
              electromagnetic fields and their interaction with atoms.  He will              
              start with two of the simplest situations:  a degenerate optical               
              parametric oscillator and two-level atoms inside an optical                    
              cavity.
