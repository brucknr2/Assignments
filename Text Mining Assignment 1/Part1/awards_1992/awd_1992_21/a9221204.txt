Abstract    :
                   Clinch Valley College requests support from NSF for connection            
              of its campus network to VERnet.  VERnet is the midlevel network               
              located in the state of Virginia.  VERnet will provide operations              
              management and information services and it will give Roanoke                   
              College connection to the NSFNET, a high speed (1.5 - 45 million               
              bits per second) National Backbone network.                                    
                   The College needs greater functionality and network speed to              
              be able to access supercomputers, libraries, and make file                     
              transfers along with being able to implement a more reliable mail              
              system.  Students and faculty research will benefit from the link.             
              This is also a unique opportunity for the school to explore                    
              innovative educational resources.
