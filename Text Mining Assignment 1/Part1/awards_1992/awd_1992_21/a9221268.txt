Abstract    :
              9221268  Vianu    Database Queries and Updates: Languages and Computational
              Aspects    This is the first year funding of a three-year continuing award.   
              Queries and updates are essential components of any database  system. 
              Databases provide languages by which users and application  programs specify
              queries and updates.  The design of such languages  requires understanding the
              interplay of various language constructs  and semantics, and the properties and
              structure of the database.   These factors have important consequences
              concerning the expressive  power of the languages and the  complexity  of
              evaluating the  queries in these languages.  Understanding these issues allows
              the  language designer to be aware of the trade-offs involved and make 
              informed decisions.  This research project concerns such issues.  
              Specifically, it focuses on new languages and programming  constructs arising
              in modern database programming in the  relational, deductive, and
              object-oriented frameworks.  The results  of this investigation will provide
              tools for the design of  languages in the various paradigms, which will be
              essential  components of future database systems for advanced applications.
