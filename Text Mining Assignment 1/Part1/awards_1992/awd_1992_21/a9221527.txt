Abstract    :
              Most major United States                                                       
              metropolitan areas possess a large                                             
              inventory of unreinforced masonry                                              
              (URM) building structures.  In                                                 
              seismic prone regions, such                                                    
              buildings represent serious threats                                            
              to the public safety.                                                          
                                                                                             
              The main objective of this project                                             
              is to study the effectiveness and                                              
              special problems of using post-                                                
              tensioned steel braces for the                                                 
              purpose of upgrading URM building                                              
              structures for seismic hazard                                                  
              mitigation.  Such a technique                                                  
              overcomes a lot of problems

              schemes and holds much promise for                                             
              broad applications in seismic
