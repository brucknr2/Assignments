Abstract    :
              9221733  Reimer  Automated DNA sequencer will be used by the Biotechnology- 
              Molecular Biology Instrumentation and Training Facility at  the University of
              Hawaii in studies that will include  characterization of the DNA that codes for
              the motility  protein dynein; evolutionary studies on mitochondrial DNA;  and
              characterization of significant genetic elements from  Drosophila, marine
              microbial species, and tropical crop  plants.  Biological researchers from
              several schools and  research institutes of the University will use the 
              instrument for highly repetitive sequencing of specific  loci from multiple
              sources, for extensive sequencing of  specific structural genes, and for
              characterization of PCR  amplified "micro-satellite" DNA fragments. Automated
              DNA  sequencing equipment can now perform this monotonous task  with comparable
              or higher accuracy than manual methods,  with lower personnel requirements and
              without the need for  radioactive materials. This instrument will provide
              access  to DNA sequencing services to approximately 40 research  groups on
              campus on a minimal fee basis.
