Abstract    :
              In this project in the Physical Chemistry Program of the                       
              Chemistry Division, Peter Armentrout of the University of Utah                 
              will use flowing afterglow ion production and guided ion beam                  
              mass spectrometry in a systematic determination of gas phase                   
              reactivity and thermochemistry, especially of transition metal                 
              atomic and organometallic ions.  Employing the technique of                    
              electronic state chromatography, Armentrout will also state                    
              select transition metal ions and study their dynamic behavior.                 
              Detailed kinetic and thermodynamic data will be obtained at                    
              both thermal and hyperthermal energies.  Reactions of ions with                
              a wide range of neutral reagents will be examined.                             
              %%%                                                                            
              By studying reactions involving electrically charged molecules                 
              containing transition metal atoms, Armentrout can determine                    
              many properties of the corresponding neutral species, such as                  
              the stability of different molecules or the strength of bonds                  
              between these atoms and attached units called ligands.  Such                   
              information is useful for understanding many processes, such as                
              catalysis, which involve transition metals.  The results of                    
              other phases of this work also impacts atmospheric chemistry                   
              and surface chemistry.
