                    radiopharmaceutical agents.                                              
              %%%                                                                            
              This award will assist in the purchase of a modern nuclear magnetic            
              resonance (NMR) spectrometer.  This instrument is an essential tool            
              for faculty members at the University of Missouri engaged in                   
              chemical research.  The instrument provides important information              
              which in most cases can be used to determine the geometric and/or              
              molecular structure of newly synthesized molecules.
