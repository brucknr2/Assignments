Abstract    :
              The production of the phytotoxin rhizobitoxine by Bradyrhizobium               
              japonicum in soybean root nodules confers a pathogenic character to            
              the normally mutually beneficial symbiosis by causing a transient              
              foliar chlorosis, thus blurring the distinction between mutualistic            
              and parasitic symbiosis.  Toxin synthesis is dependent upon the                
              genotype of both the host plant and bacteria.  By selecting for                
              mutants that no longer synthesize rhizobitoxine in culture, several            
              mutants with altered symbiotic phenotypes have been identified.                
              One group of mutants does not make toxin in culture or in planta.              
              These include mutations in structural genes in rhizobitoxine                   
              biosynthesis.  Interestingly, one of these genes requires a                    
              translation frameshift for expression.  Symbiotically, the most                
              interesting group of mutants are those that fail to synthesize                 
              rhizobitoxine in cluture, but do produce rhizobitoxine in planta at            
              levels greater than wild type.  Consequently, these mutants produce            
              more severe chlorosis from which the plant does not recover.  In               
              addition, this group of mutants has altered mutualistic symbiosis.             
              The parental strain is restricted in its ability to nodulate                   
              soybeans that carry the Rj4 gene.  These mutants are able to                   
              nodulate Rj4 soybeans at rates similar to unrestricted strains.                
              This group of mutants demonstrates a relationship between                      
              rhizobitoxine biosynthesis and host range functions of                         
              Bradyrhizobium.  The goals of this proposal are to examine the                 
              biochemical and genetic mechanisms controlling these parasitic and             
              mutualistic symbiotic functions.
