Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This is a three-year cooperative study proposed                                
              by Dr. Steven Hamburg, the University of                                       
              Kansas, and Dr. Hen Biau King, Taiwan Forest                                   
              Research Institute.  This proposal plans to                                    
              study the effects of air pollution on                                          
              subtropical forests in Taiwan.  The funds                                      
              requested are primarily for supporting a                                       
              graduate student and travel.  The Taiwan                                       
              Forest Research Institute and the Taiwan                                       
              National Science Council have provided                                         
              the primary logistic and laboratory support for                                
              this study.  This is an important project since                                
              it can provide critical information for                                        
              subtropical forest research.  The success of                                   
              this study can enhance our understanding of                                    
              dynamics of the subtropical rainforest                                         
              ecosystem and its response to pollution stress                                 
              and atmosphere/biosphere interactions.
