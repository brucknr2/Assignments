Abstract    :
              The oceans play an important role in regulating the Earth's                    
              climate, not only through their well recognized role as a                      
              reservoir and transport medium for moisture and heat, but also as              
              a major dynamic reservoir for climatically sensitive gases such                
              as carbon dioxide. Interactions between physical, biological and               
              chemical processes are important to understand in order to                     
              examine the exchange of physical and chemical quantities between               
              the atmosphere and the deep oceans.  The goal of this project is               
              to develop, test and modify an integrated physical-biological-                 
              carbon dioxide ocean model in an effort to simulate and evaluate               
              interactions controlling the exchange of carbon dioxide between                
              the atmosphere and ocean in the Southern Ocean.  The Southern                  
              Ocean is of particular importance because it represents one of                 
              two regions in the world where significant deep water comes in                 
              contact with the atmosphere, allowing direct exchange of gases                 
              where substantial quantities of surface water downwell to aphotic              
              depths while still containing high concentrations of unutilized                
              nutrients at the Antarctic Polar Front.  The potential                         
              utilization of excess nutrients by phytoplankton may have a                    
              substantial impact on carbon dioxide flux.  The large seasonal                 
              variability within the physical, biological, and chemical system               
              leads to an extreme range in the rate and direction of exchange                
              with atmosphere and consequently, it is not clear whether this                 
              region is one of net uptake or release of carbon dioxide to the                
              atmosphere.  Results from this modelling effort will prove                     
              important to advancing oceanographic research in the Southern                  
              Ocean.
