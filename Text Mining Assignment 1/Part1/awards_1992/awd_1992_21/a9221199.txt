Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Technical Narrative:                                                           
                                                                                             
              This U.S.-Turkey collaborative research project involving                      
              physicists from the University of California at Los Angeles (UCLA)             
              and Cukurova University in Adana, Turkey will launch a new full-               
              scale analysis of data on alpha-alpha interactions.  Project                   
              funding will enable Drs. Nazife Ozdes and Ayse Kuzucu of Cukurova              
              University to work with Dr. Peter Schlein and his team from UCLA at            
              the Super Proton Synchrotron at CERN (Switzerland).  Additionally,             
              after Drs. Ozdes and Kuzucu return to their university, members of             
              Schlein's team will visit them in order to continue the full                   
              physics analysis.  This new collaborative research effort will                 
              build on data compiled from a previous experiment conducted by                 
              Schlein's team at CERN.  These data constitute the first evidence              
              for diffractive production of multi-Lambda systems in ion                      
              collisions.  Consequently, a more detailed understanding of alpha-             
              alpha interactions will permit the team to extrapolate to larger               
              ion beams.  This project is important because ion beams can provide            
              a production mechanism for bound multi-Lambda systems, thereby,                
              avoiding the uncertainties of production via the conjectured quark-            
              gluon plasma mechanism.                                                        
                                                                                             
              This project in high energy physics fulfills the program objective             
              of advancing scientific knowledge by enabling leading experts in               
              the United States and Turkey to combine complementary talents and              
              pool research resources in areas of strong mutual interest and                 
              competence.
