Abstract    :
                   This is the first year funding of a three-year continuing                 
              award.  Natural Language learning is a paradigm problem for                    
              Artificial Intelligence and Cognitive Science.  The world's                    
              languages differ significantly in grammar and conceptual structure             
              but all are learned easily by children.  This research continues               
              the exploration of language acquisition in the restricted domain of            
              simple geometric scenes and sequences.  The methodology is                     
              structured connectionist modelling with an extended version of                 
              back-propagation learning techniques.  One critical task of this               
              research is developing a system capable of learning individual                 
              spatial relation terms from any of a wide range of languages, as               
              part of a broad inter-disciplinary effort on natural language                  
              acquisition.  It includes the learning of grammatical rules and                
              more complex sentences and adding inferential capabilities to the              
              existing system.  //
