Abstract    :
              This research project, in the Analytical and Surface Chemistry                 
              Program, will develop the use of in situ NMR spectroscopy for                  
              the study of catalytic reactions.  Instrumental development                    
              will be undertaken to allow the use of NMR under the high                      
              temperature and pressure conditions of typical catalytic                       
              systems.  This approach will be used to carry out a systematic                 
              investigation of catalytic chemistry of zeolite materials.  In                 
              addition, preliminary studies of mechanisms of enzymatic                       
              catalysis will be attempted using these methods.

              A detailed understanding of the mechanisms of catalytic                        
              reactions is essential for a number of important technologies,                 
              including commodity chemical production and fine chemical                      
              synthesis.  The chemical information which is available from                   
              NMR methods can provide this sort of understanding.  This                      
              research project will develop instrumentation which will enable                
              the use of NMR in catalytic studies, and will systematically                   
              apply these methods to important classes of catalytic reaction.
