Abstract    :

              Sciences on the study of the cycling and mobility                              
              of lead and its isotopes.  Aquatic habitats are                                
              threatened by urban and industrial inputs of                                   
              toxicants such as heavy metals. Lead is one of                                 
              the most toxic, and is concentrated in sediments                               
              of lakes and estuaries.  Little is understood                                  
              about the cycling of such heavy metals in lakes.                               
              Using facilities in China and in the US, the                                   
              investigators will study the mobility of lead                                  
              across the sediment-water interface in some                                    
              Chinese lakes.                                                                 
                                                                                             
              This study should contribute to the assessment of                              
              radioactive dating techniques used for                                         
              paleolimnological studies and of anthropogenic                                 
              effects of the toxicant lead.
