Abstract    :
                   This award supports research by a senior faculty member,                  
              an Assistant Professor, and an Assistant Research Professor at                 
              Boston University.  They study fundamental properties of                       
              elementary particles, especially those connected with the                      
              electroweak sector of the standard model.  Major activities                    
              are with the L3 group who operate at the electron-positron                     
              collider, LEP, at CERN.  Some particular goals are discovery                   
              of Higgs and SUSY particles or at least extensions of their                    
              currently established mass limits, measurement of the partial                  
              width of Z decay to b-quark pairs, and test of standard model                  
              predictions at energies above W-pair production threshold.  In                 
              preparation for the future SSC-dominated era, they participate                 
              in design studies for the GEM detector.  Data from GEM (and                    
              SDC) will begin to clarify the electroweak symmetry breaking                   
              mechanism, either with the discovery of the Higgs or some as                   
              yet unknown phenomena outside the Standard Model.
