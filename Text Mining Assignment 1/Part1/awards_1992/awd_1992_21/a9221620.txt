Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The profound effect of body temperature on physiology can have a               
              major impact on the ecology and survival of organisms.                         
              Consequently, global climate warming may have manifold biological              
              repercussions. However, the effects of climate warming might be                
              ameliorated if evolution can quickly alter the thermal sensitivity             
              of fast-breeding organisms such as insects.                                    
                                                                                             
              This project will use two different approaches to study                        
              experimentally how fruit flies respond evolutionary to simulated               
              climate change in the laboratory. The first approach uses an                   
              efficient new technique that enables us to breed flies that are                
              very resistant to periodic exposure to heat or cold or both. This              
              approach involves monitoring physiological divergence in stocks of             
              flies that have already been evolving at different temperatures for            
              several years. This study will monitor how quickly physiology                  
              responds evolutionarily to a sustained shift in (non-extreme)                  
              temperatures.                                                                  
                                                                                             
              Using both sets of flies, we will determine how quickly the                    
              sensitivity of physiology to temperature can evolve as well as any             
              important side effects (life history, resistance to other studies              
              will have direct implications for projection models of how insect              
              populations will respond to global climate warming.
