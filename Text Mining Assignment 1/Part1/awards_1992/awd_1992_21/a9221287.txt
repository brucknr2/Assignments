Abstract    :
                   The Board on Mathematical Sciences (BMS), National Research               
              Council (NRC) through its Committee on Applied and Theoretical                 
              Statistics (CATS) will convene two 1-1/2 day symposia on the                   
              topic Modern Interdisciplinary University Statistics Education,                
              one at the National Academy of Sciences in Washington, DC, and                 
              one at the Beckman Center in Irvine, CA.  The topics of                        
              discussion at these symposia will be what changes in statistics                
              education are needed to: (1) incorporate interdisciplinary                     
              training into upper-undergraduate, graduate, and postdoctoral                  
              statistics programs, (2) bring upper-undergraduate and graduate                
              statistics curricula up to date, and (3) improve apprenticing of               
              statistics graduate and postdoctoral students and appropriately                
              reward faculty mentors.  Proceedings based upon the presentations              
              and discussions at both symposia will be produced and                          
              disseminated after the second symposium.
