Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This project will build a "cool", moderate resolution, 200<R<2000,             
              slit spectrograph to mate to a near-IR camera at McDonald                      
              Observatory.  This new spectrometer (the spectrograph part of which            
              is referred to as CoolSpec) offers large advantages, both in                   
              sensitivity and operationally, compared to the present near-IR                 
              spectrometer, IRGS.  The new spectrograph will be flexible enough              
              to take advantage of new developments in near-IR array technology.             
                                                                                             
              Observational programs that will be undertaken with the new                    
              spectrometer are:  studies of star formation in our own and other              
              galaxies, supernova atmospheres, the environment of planetary                  
              nebulae, planetary atmospheres, and reflectance spectra of rocky               
              solar system bodies.
