Abstract    :
                   This award adds five higher education institutions to the                 
              MOREnet state network.  Four of the institutions are primarily                 
              undergraduate colleges, and one is a junior college.  The new                  
              institutions connect to a hub located at the University of Missouri            
              at Columbia.  Faculty and students at the institutions will benefit            
              from access to the resources of the Internet, including libraries              
              and supercomputer.  In addition, they will be able to communicate              
              and collaborate with colleagues at other campuses in pursuit of                
              research and educational projects.
