Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Technical Narrative:                                                           
                                                                                             
              This proposed workshop, organized by the American Meteorological               
              Society in conjunction with the African Academy of Sciences, is                
              scheduled for 11-14 December 1992 in Nairobi, Kenya.  This workshop            
              immediately follows the First International Conference of the                  
              African Meteorological Society to be held 07-11 December.  As the              
              focus of the Nairobi conference is the Africa drought, attendance              
              will provide an invaluable resource for the workshop participants              
              toward the formulation of the drought research agenda.  This                   
              proposal supports the attendance of 16 scientists from the U.S. and            
              Africa (eight each from the U.S. and Africa).                                  
                                                                                             
              This workshop to plan future collaborative research activities                 
              fulfills the program objective of advancing scientific knowledge by            
              enabling leading experts in the United States and Africa to combine            
              complementary talents and pool research resources in areas of                  
              strong mutual interest and competence.
