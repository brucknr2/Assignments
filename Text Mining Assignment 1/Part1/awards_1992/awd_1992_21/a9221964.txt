Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  The research is designed to illuminate the psycholinguistic               
              processes involved in implementing long-distance dependencies                  
              during language production.  Such dependencies constitute a                    
              considerable theoretical challenge, since the abstract structural              
              knowledge required to reliably format the discontinuous elements               
              does not straightforwardly mesh with the articulatory requirement              
              of incremental, word-by-word production.  The dependencies to be               
              explored are, primarily, number agreement between subjects and                 
              verbs, and, secondarily, number agreement between subjects and                 
              subject anaphors.  Because verb agreement in English may call on               
              a range of information about number from the nonlinguistic                     
              message, from the lexicon, from the morphology, and from other                 
              sources, it offers many opportunities to examine the transmission              
              and interaction of information during language production.                     
              Conversely, because it exhibits strict syntactic conditioning ,                
              it offers opportunities to observe constraints on the                          
              transmission and interaction of information.  Predictions about                
              the nature of information transmission and the types of                        
              constraints likely to operate are derived from an approach to                  
              production developed by Garrett (1975, 1988) and elaborated by                 
              others (Bock, 1987a; Lapointe, 1985; Lapointe and Dell, 1989;                  
              Levelt, 1989).  The experiments employ agreement-error                         
              elicitation tasks inn tandem with time pronunciation tasks to                  
              explore the nature of the number information used in the                       
              agreement operation, the nature of subject identification and                  
              maintenance operations, and the processing demands of agreement                
              implementation.
