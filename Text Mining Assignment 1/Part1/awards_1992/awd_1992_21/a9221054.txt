Abstract    :
                   As regional and national networking infrastructure matures,               
              so does the work force needed to operate and maintain it.  New                 
              network operations centers (NOC) personnel must digest                         
              information about a perplexing mixture of devices and software                 
              for monitoring, updating, and maintaining the network and                      
              reporting the necessary statistics.                                            
                   This document proposes production of a videotaped course                  
              built on the foundation of experience gained during the past year              
              in which the OARnet engineering staff carried out ongoing                      
              classroom training in network operations.  A workbook will also                
              be compiled and will accompany the videotaped instructions.                    
                   Training will greatly increase productivity and the ability               
              to take on more responsibility for complex network monitoring and              
              problem solving.
