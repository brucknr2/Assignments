              extendand expand data series concerning patenting in the United                
              States.                                                                        
                                                                                             
                   Data will include numbers of patents granted year by year to              
              Americans and to citizens of other specified countries; patents                
              owned by individuals as opposed to private corporate entities and              
              governments; and, patents assigned to universities and colleges.               
              Counts of granted patents will be classified by both the Patent

                   These data are used in the National Science Board's series                
              of Science and Engineering reports as indicators of levels of

              fields.
