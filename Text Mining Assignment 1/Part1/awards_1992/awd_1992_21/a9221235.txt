Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  This project explores the relationship of hard physical labor             
              under natural conditions (Polish peasant women in a mountainous                
              region), and fertility (specifically ovarian function as assayed by            
              steroid levels in saliva).  The working hypothesis is that, even               
              with adequate diet, physical exertion can cause the suppression of             
              what we think of as normal female ovarian cycling, which has been              
              shown to be the case in female athletes in the U.S.A.                          
                                                                                             
                   The student will go to Poland in the winter to collect data               
              during that seasonal period to compare already collected and                   
              analyzed materials from the summer, to see if seasonal variation in            
              ovarian function exists among the harder working women.  The                   
              working hypothesis is that their steroid levels will fluctuate with            
              workload, while less hard working women's levels will remain                   
              roughly the same.
