Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This award is for the renewal of the Materials Research                        
              Group at Purdue University (prior award DMR-8913706) on the                    
              topic of tetrahedrally coordinated compound semiconductors                     
              and their heterostructures.  The research includes  growth                     
              of materials using  molecular beam epitaxial techniques;                       
              spectroscopic characterization in the visible, far infrared,                   
              and microwaves; transmission electron microscopy; magnetic                     
              property measurements; ultra low temperature calorimetry;                      
              study of quantum confinement of excitonic states; nature of                    
              the heterointerfaces; characterization of optoelectronic                       
              properties.  The materials being studied include: manganese                    
              selenide, manganese telluride, cadmium manganese selenide,                     
              compounds doped with magnetic ions, and superlattices of                       
              these materials.                                                               
              %%%                                                                            
              These materials have interesting properties and combinations                   
              of properties, for example, both semiconducting and magnetic                   
              properties, optoelectronic properties, and lasing in the                       
              blue and bluegreen part of the spectrum.  Potential                            
              applications include optoelectronic signal processing,                         
              lasers, long wavelength infrared detection, flat panel                         
              display technology, etc.  The group has a long history of                      
              interdisciplinary research that covers the range of                            
              fundamental science and technology.  Students trained by                       
              this group have been highly successful.
