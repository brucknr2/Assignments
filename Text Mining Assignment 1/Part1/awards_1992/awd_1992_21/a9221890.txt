Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                                         ABSTRACT                                            
                                                                                             
                  Auburn University plans to host a conference on Language                  
              Variety in the south, a follow-up to one held in 1981 at the                   
              University of South Carolina.  The Auburn conference will meet                 
              April 1-3, 1993, in conjunction with Spring SECOL (Southeastern                
              Conference on Linguistics).  It will provide a forum for scholars              
              in a variety of disciplines, from widely separated parts of this               
              country and from other countries, who would otherwise not be able              
              to meet conveniently.                                                          
                                                                                             
                   Among the goals of the conference are too encourage                       
              collaboration across disciplines, to promote discussion among                  
              junior and senior scholars of ongoing research projects, to                    
              expose recent Ph.D.'s and advanced graduate students to recent                 
              research in Southern American English, and to foster an exchange               
              between researchers and local community members.  Sociolinguists,              
              dialect geographers, lexicographers, historians, literary                      
              scholars, and educators will share their research on language                  
              variety in the Southern United States.  Each day will focus on a               
              different theme:  Thursday on Materials and Methods; Friday on                 
              Language Contact, Conflict, and Controversy; and Saturday on                   
              Discourse and Dialect Diversity.  Keynote addresses, panels, and               
              paper sessions have been structured so as to advance knowledge                 
              through presentation of new data, to encourage exploration of                  
              methodological issues, and to provide opportunities for debate                 
              over controversial themes.                                                     
                                                                                             
                   The impact of the conference will extend well beyond the                  
              region.  Through satellite transmission, videotaping, and a                    
              volume of proceedings, conference activities will be made                      
              accessible to an audience much wider than that in attendance.
