Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This US-Czechoslovakia research project between                                
              Dr. Mark Hillery of Hunter College, City                                       
              University of New York, and Dr. Vladimir Buzek                                 
              of the Institute of Physics, Slovak Academy of                                 
              Sciences, will pursue application of the basic                                 
              theory of squeezed spin states to                                              
              interferometric phase measurements.                                            
              Specifically, the researchers will examine                                     
              quadratic squeezing involving variables in                                     
              quantum optical systems which are quadratic in                                 
              the mode creation and annihilation operators.                                  
              Drs. Hillery and Buzek maintain that these                                     
              variables can be observed using combinations of                                
              beam splitters and parametric amplifiers or                                    
              four-wave mixers.  They intend to use these                                    
              variables as probes of quantum optical systems                                 
              or field-matter systems to determine more                                      
              accurate and practical measurement schemes.                                    
                                                                                             
              This joint research project in theoretical                                     
              physics fulfills the program objective of                                      
              advancing scientific knowledge by enabling                                     
              leading experts in the United States and                                       
              Eastern Europe to combine complementary talents                                
              and pool resources in areas of strong mutual                                   
              interest and competence.
