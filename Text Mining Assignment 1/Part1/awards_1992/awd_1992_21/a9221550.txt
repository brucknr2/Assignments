Abstract    :
                   The goal of this project is to electronically link Hahnemann              
              University's clinical campuses and major affiliated hospitals to               
              INTERNET by creating a multi-institutional computer network between            
              Hahnemann and four of these hospitals.   They are Crozer-Chester               
              Medical Center near Philadelphia, Guthrie Medical Center and Easton            
              Hospital in rural Pennsylvania and Monmouth Medical Cetner in a New            
              Jersey shore community.  A fifth hospital, Lehigh Valley Hospital              
              in Allentown, Pennsylvania will be provided the same access and                
              serves as the other hospitals through an already planned INTERNET              
              link.                                                                          
                   In addition to access to the resources of INTERNET, benefits              
              will include increased communication among Hahnemann and its                   
              affiliates, and ready access to the information resources of the               
              Hahnemann University Library from the affiliates.  Hahnemann  staff            
              will train information professionals at the affiliates who have                
              agreed to train and support their users.  Administrators at the                
              affiliates have committed to paying the long-term maintenance                  
              costs.
