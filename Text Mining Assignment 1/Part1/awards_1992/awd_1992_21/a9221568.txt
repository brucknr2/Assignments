Abstract    :
                   The Division of Research of the Kaiser Permanente Medical Care            
              Program proposes to connect its local area network to the NSFNET               
              for the purpose of facilitating its research activities.  DOR is               
              applying to the National Science Foundation for a grant to share               
              the cost of hardware, software and communication services to                   
              connect its Ethernet local area network to NSFNET, under the                   
              "Connections to NSFNET" program through an interagency agreement               
              with the National Library of Medicine.  A connection to NSFNET                 
              would allow communication between over 150 DOR researchers and                 
              colleagues in the academic community, at other medical research                
              institutions and in government agencies, who already have Internet             
              connectivity.  It would facilitate the transfer of data, documents             
              and ideas between researchers at DOR and other institutions who are            
              working on collaborative projects and multicenter research studies.            
                                                                                             
              It would also provide collaborative projects and multicenter                   
              research studies.  It would also provide DOR investigators with                
              access to national networks and services and improve access to                 
              services which are currently limited by 2400 baud modem                        
              connections.                                                                   
                                                                                             
                   To gain access to NSFNET, DOR proposes to connect its LAN to              
              the Bay Area Regional Research Network (BARRNet), a regional data              
              network connected to NSFNET, using a leased line between DOR and a             
              port on the BARRNet backbone at the University of California,                  
              Berkeley.
