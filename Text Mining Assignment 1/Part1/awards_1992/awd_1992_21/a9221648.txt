Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The determination of large scale structure in the universe                     
              is a major problem in astrophysics today.  During the last                     
              two years, the Principal Investigator has begun to produce                     
              results from a redshift survey which aims to map the                           
              universe beyond 1 billion light years distance.  The project                   
              consists of measuring 25,000 selected galaxies, and                            
              positions and magnitudes of 20,000 galaxies have been                          
              obtained.  Approximately 10,000 spectra have been obtained,                    
              and they have measured distances to 5,000 galaxies.  This                      
              project will be continued through this grant.                                  
                                                                                             
              The Principal Investigator is regarded as a world leader in                    
              this research area.
