Abstract    :
                   Internet communication will benefit the LMF Medical Library,              
              the NMR research group and the photomedicine group.  The Library               
              which supports 300 physicians, will benefit from electronic                    
              interlibrary loans, access to on line catalogues, and email.  The              
              NMR and photomedicine group will use the connection for transfer of            
              image clusters and access to various databases.                                
                   The technical approach for connecting to the Internet is very             
              sound and cost effective.                                                      
                   Do not fund $5,000 in salary.
