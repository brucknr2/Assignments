Abstract    :
              9221362  Cooper  This award supports the United States Antarctic Research
              Program  component of a joint U.S.   Italian project to investigate the 
              acoustic characteristics of the lithosphere of the Ross Sea and the  adjacent
              Transantarctic Mountains.  The joint project involves  deployment of recording
              seismometers along a line at approximately  76 S, from the East Antarctic Ice
              Sheet, across the Transantarctic  Mountains, and across the Victoria Basin
              portion of the Ross Sea.   Land based seismometers and ocean bottom
              seismometers will be  deployed to gather seismic reflection and refraction data
              that will  be used to infer the structure and composition of the lithosphere 
              in the region.  ***
