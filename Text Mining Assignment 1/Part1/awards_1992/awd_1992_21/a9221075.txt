Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Accurate Doppler Accelerometry of Stars.                                       
                                                                                             
              Dr. McMillan will continue measuring changes in the radial                     
              velocities of solar-type stars to search for gravitational                     
              perturbations by planets.  The data now span 5 years, a time scale             
              comparable to some planetary orbital periods.  Over 2300                       
              observations of 16 stars similar to the Sun have been accumulated.             
              These observations show that the instrument is stable enough to                
              reveal the kinematic effects of Jupiter-size planets.  The                     
              velocities of some of the target stars appear to be changing                   
              slowly.  As the length of the data series increases, new                       
              observations with unaltered instrumentation become more and more               
              valuable because they increase the sensitivity and frequency                   
              resolution in the series' periodograms.  Longer term observations              
              are necessary to see whether the apparent variations in velocity               
              are periodic.
