Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Dr. Holland proposes to work at the interface between the fields of            
              evolution and development with the overall purpose of understanding            
              the origin of the vertebrates from the invertebrates. The most                 
              tractable goal is to establish homologies between expression                   
              domains of pattern controlling genes (e.g. homeobox genes) during              
              ontogeny of lancelets (amphioxus) and tunicates. These genes will              
              be isolated and sequenced and will be used to prepare riboprobes               
              and antibodies for detection of the gene products within the                   
              context of the embryonic and larval tissues. By comparing the                  
              protochordate expression domains to those already known for                    
              developing vertebrates, Dr. Holland the can generate unprecedented             
              new homologies and use them to evaluate existing theories of                   
              vertebrate origins and possibly as a basis for new hypotheses. The             
              initial study has already yielded new insights into the                        
              evolutionary origin of the vertebrate head and brain.
