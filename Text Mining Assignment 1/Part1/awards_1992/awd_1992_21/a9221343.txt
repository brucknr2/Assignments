Abstract    :
              This grant provides fund for the U.S. portion of a collaboration               
              between Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory                    
              (JHU/APL), British Antarctic Survey (BAS) and the South African                
              National Antarctic Programme to build and operate an over-the-                 
              horizon high frequency (HF) auroral radar at the new South African             
              station, Sanae.  The project is known as the  Southern Hemisphere              
              Auroral Radar Experiment (SHARE).  SHARE is essentially identical              
              with the existing Polar Anglo-American Conjugate Experiment (PACE)             
              radar at the BAS station at Halley Bay, Antarctica.  When operated             
              together, SHARE and PACE will provide 2-D mapping of plasma flow               
              within their very large overlapping fields of view.  Fortunately,              
              they overlap above the U.S. South Pole station as well as much of              
              the area to be instrumented with the new Automatic Geophysical                 
              Observatories (AGO's) and, therefore, can provide valuable                     
              additional information on the large-scale plasma flows above the               
              observatories.                                                                 
                                                                                             
              These radars will also complement similar facilities in the                    
              Northern Hemisphere and will help to show how the aurora are                   
              sometimes the same and sometimes different in these magnetically               
              connected regions.  JHU/APL is the world leader in over-the-horizon            
              HF auroral radar.
