Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  Preliminary excavations in Southeastern China by this                     
              productive young principal investigator and his colleagues have                
              yielded very exciting fossil remains of a number of heretofore                 
              unknown primate (and other mammalian) species from the Eocene.                 
              This is an entirely new biogeographic region, and the project holds            
              out the promise of providing a critical piece of the story of early            
              primate evolution.  This project will now be expanded in scope and             
              intensity.
