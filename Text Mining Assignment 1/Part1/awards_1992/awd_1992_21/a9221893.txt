Abstract    :
                   Previous investigation of eolian material preserved in deep               
              sea sediments has resulted in new information concerning the                   
              behavior of continental climate and atmospheric circulation on the             
              orbital and tectonic time scales.  These studies have been hampered            
              by the need for positive identification of the continental source              
              of the mineral dust and the determination of the degree of dilution            
              or masking of the continental eolian signal by material from                   
              volcanic and hydrothermal sources.  This award supports research               
              designed to isolate a pure eolian signal and to determine the                  
              provenance of the signal by a combination of geochemical and                   
              geostatistical techniques.
