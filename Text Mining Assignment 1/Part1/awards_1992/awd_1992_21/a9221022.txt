Abstract    :
                   The selection of local host plant for generalized insect                  
              herbivores is a complex process that involves biochemical plant                
              defenses, insect behavior, insect detoxification, and evolutionary             
              "constraints" related to recent and past ecological factors which              
              have resulted in differential mortality on different plant species             
              (and hence natural selection for use of specific hosts).                       
              The PIs have proposed a new hypothesis to help explain local                   
              feeding specialization where numerous host choices are available.              
              This concept (called the voltinism-suitability hypothesis)                     
              integrates abiotic and biotic environmental influences in order to             
              predict host selection in the face of multiple options for plant-              
              feeding insects.  Species of Papilio butterflies are a model system            
              to explore ecological processes of predation, parasitism, and                  
              competition as factors affecting host choice.  This research will              
              assess the relative significance of these selective pressures                  
              compared to the seasonal thermal unit restrictions and insect                  
              evolutionary history as determinants of specific feeding choice in             
              generalized insects.  Such information may improve the predictive              
              capabilities in regard to host shifts, and the evolution of insect             
              populations that are resistant to natural plant defensive chemicals            
              and synthetic pesticides.
