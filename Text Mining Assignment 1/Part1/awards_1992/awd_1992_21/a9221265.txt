Abstract    :
              This award in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic                  
              Program will support research on the thermodynamics of                         
              organometallic reactions by Dr. Carl D. Hoff of the Chemistry                  
              Department, University of Miami.  Although Hoff will                           
              investigate a wide variety of reactions, of particular interest                
              are reactions of molybdenum sulfur complexes.  These complexes                 
              are chosen for study because of their involvement in                           
              hydrodesulfurization catalysis, which effects the removal of                   
              sulfur from fuels, and nitrogen fixation in plants.  Oxidative                 
              addition of hydrogen, hydrogen sulfide, thiols, and disulfides                 
              to molybdenum will be studied.  The enthalpies of binding of                   
              various sulfur-containing species--thioethers, thiols, hydrogen                
              sulfide, thiophene, disulfides, metallothiolates, and sulfur                   
              dioxide--to molybdenum will also be determined.                                
              %%%                                                                            
              Dr. Hoff will investigate the energetics of molybdenum-sulfur                  
              bonds.  The results will be of wide interest because little                    
              fundamental data concerning the thermodynamics of metal-sulfur                 
              bonds is currently available.  Sulfur can bond to metals in a                  
              variety of bonding modes (single, multiple, bridging) and the                  
              strength of these bonds is influenced by the oxidation state of                
              the metal and the presence of other groups around the metal.                   
              Understanding the influence of these factors for the molybdenum                
              case could contribute to a better understanding and control of                 
              the catalytic processes of hydrodesulfurization and nitrogen                   
              fixation.
