Abstract    :
                   This is a workshop to assist the U.S. Intelligent                         
              Manufacturing Systems (IMS) steering and technical committees to               
              inform the academic community of the IMS opportunities and to                  
              assist the development of industrial partnerships.  This puts the              
              NSF in a position to determine its role as a source of Federal                 
              support for university participation in future national and                    
              international IMS collaborations.                                              
                   Specifically, this workshop seeks to enhance the                          
              understanding of Request for Expression of Interest (REI)                      
              respondents about the IMS program, encourage the development of                
              industry-government-academia teams, facilitate collaboration                   
              among U.S. participants, and assist collaborative efforts in fully             
              understanding program requirements under the Terms of Reference                
              and Modalities of Operation for the various IMS "test cases".
