Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This award will provide travel support for a six-month visit by                
              Dr. Jon Witman of the Marine Science Center, Northeastern                      
              University to New Zealand. The fjords of southwestern New Zealand              
              represent a unique and scientifically important marine                         
              environment which contains fragile communities dominated by many               
              rare and unusual species. Present understanding of the                         
              environmental processes that support the biological communities                
              in the fjords is very limited and is hindering the ability to                  
              manage the area. The University of Otago's Department of Marine                
              Science has made a long-term commitment to participation in,                   
              and facilitating marine research in the fjords.  Prof.                         
              Philip Mladenov from Otago University will serve as the                        
              New Zealand collaborator.                                                      
                                                                                             
              The subtidal rock walls of the fjords provide an excellent                     
              opportunity to investigate the relative roles of physical and                  
              biotic processes in maintaining community structure due to the                 
              conspicuous zonation of sessile invertebrates and the highly                   
              stratified fjord water column. Two primary zones have been                     
              identified, a shallow mussel-serpulid polychaete zone and a deep               
              suspension feeding zone. Specifically, this collaborative                      
              research project will investigate if the limits of these zones                 
              are determined by larval supply and/or sea star predation.
