Abstract    :
                   Sangamon State University requests support from NSF for                   
              connection of their campus to netIllinois.  NetIllinois is part of             
              the CICnet regional network and is the midlevel network located in             
              this part of the state of Illinois that will give the operations               
              and network information services.  It will give the university a 56            
              thousand bits per second connection to the NSFNET, a high speed                
              (1.5 - 45 million bits per second) National Backbone network.                  
                   The university needs greater functionality and network speed              
              to be able to access supercomputers, libraries, and make file                  
              transfers along with being able to implement a more reliable mail              
              system.  Students and faculty research will benefit from the link.             
              This is also a unique opportunity for the school to explore                    
              innovative educational resources.
