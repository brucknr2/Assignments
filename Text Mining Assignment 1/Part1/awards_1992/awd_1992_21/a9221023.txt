Abstract    :
              9221023  Wallace    A combined experimental and numerical modeling investigation
               is to be conducted on equilibrium and non-equilibrium  turbulent boundary
              layers. The experimental part will utilize  unique multi-element hot wire
              probes previously developed by  the investigator. The plan is to use a
              two-probe arrangement  of these instruments to obtain two-point turbulence 
              information which characterize spatial extent and coherence of  organized
              turbulent structures. One of the issues to be  addressed is energy transfer
              from small to large scales, or  backscatter. The modeling component is aimed at
              incorporating  the effects of backscatter into Large Eddy Simulation models. 
              Concurrent Direct Numerical Simulations are to complement the  experiments.   
              Large Eddy Simulation modeling is an important predictive tool  for complex
              turbulent flows. Many important features are still  not accounted for, and more
              realism will permit more accurate  engineering predictions.   ***
