Abstract    :
              This project involves the scientific analysis of a unique,                     
              longitudinal data base on the role of technology policy in the                 
              diffusion of computing in twelve Asia-Pacific countries.  The                  
              purposes are to:  (1) describe evolving trends in the international            
              diffusion of computing technology; (2) develop understanding of the            
              relationship between government technology policy and the diffusion            
              of computing; and (3) assess the effect of environmental factors,              
              especially economic development and computing infrastructure, on               
              the diffusion of computing.  The method involves quantitative                  
              analysis--by country, across countries, and over time--of                      
              relationships between the extent, rate, breadth and pattern of                 
              computing diffusion and two sets of independent variables:                     
              environmental factors and technology policy.  The analyses will use            
              data already collected for the period 1980-1992, which will be                 
              supplemented annually for each country.  The quantitative analysis             
              will be bolstered by reference to qualitative case histories of                
              each country's political, economic and infrastructure environment,             
              its government technology policy, and its diffusion results.  The              
              analyses also will be reviewed by experts in each country who are              
              familiar with government technology policy and computing diffusion.            
              The results of the research will be new understanding about the                
              relative influences of environmental factors and of government                 
              technology policy on the diffusion of computing production and use             
              within a country and across countries.  The results also will                  
              include a general model of the relationship between general                    
              economic conditions in a country and computing diffusion; and a                
              unique and valuable database that other scholars can use to pursue             
              related scientific and policy questions.
