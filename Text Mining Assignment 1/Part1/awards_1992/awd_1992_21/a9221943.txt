Abstract    :
              A five day (August 9-13, 1992) workshop on Fuzzy-                              
              Neuro Systems is proposed by the College of                                    
              Engineering and Technology at Tennessee State                                  
              University to introduce and provide handson                                    
              experience to the faculty and graduate students                                
              from Historically Black Colleges and Universities                              
              (HBCU) who have either engineering and or                                      
              computer science degree programs.  A similar five-                             
              day workshop on Neural Networks was funded by                                  
              NSF, in May 20-21, l991 and was extremely                                      
              successful.
