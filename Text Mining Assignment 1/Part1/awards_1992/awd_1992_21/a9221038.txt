Abstract    :
                   Professor Fry will mount a test of a previously untested                  
              strong "Bell's inequality".  This experiment will be a true                    
              realization of the Einstein-Podlosky-Rosen famous "thought                     
              experiment" in which angular momentum correlations between two                 
              spin one-half mercury atom will be measured.
