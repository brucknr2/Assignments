Abstract    :
              In this research, neural network and schemalevel models of visual-  motor
              conditional learning in monkeys will be extended to cover a  wider  range  of
              reaching and grasping behaviors.   These  models  will  then be used as a basis
              for robot learning, including  such  paradigms  as reinforcement learning,
              staged learning,  focus  of  attention,  and  learning by showing.  The
              resulting  neural  net  strategies  will then be used to enable a robot to
              learn  to  use  visual and tactile input to grasp arbitrary objects, to
              construct  assemblies of blocks, and to coordinate the motion of  two  arms. 
              Existing  tools for neural network simulation will be  interfaced  with
              software for robot sensing and control.
