Abstract    :
                   The project will support the Joint Summer Research Conferences            
              in the Mathematical Sciences, administered by the American                     
              Mathematical Society, the Society for Industrial and Applied                   
              Mathematics and the Institute of Mathematical Statistics.  Between             
              six and ten one or two-week conferences have been held annually                
              since 1982 on a broad range of mathematical topics.  The 1993                  
              Summer Research Conferences will be held during the period July 10             
              - August 6, 1993 at the University of Washington in Seattle, WA on             
              the following topics: (1) curvature equations in conformal                     
              geometry, (2) multivariable operator theory, (3) spectral geometry,            
              (4) recent developments in the inverse Galois problem, (5)                     
              mathematics of superconductivity, (6) distributions with fixed                 
              marginals, doubly stochastic measures, and Markov operators, and               
              (7) applications of hypergroups and related measure algebras.
