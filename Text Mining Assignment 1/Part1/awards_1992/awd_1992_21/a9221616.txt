Abstract    :
              St. Petersburg Junior College requests support from NSF for                    
              connection of their campus networkds to SURANet.  SURAnet is the               
              midlevel network located in the southeastern United States.  It                
              will provide operations management and information services and it             
              will give St. Petersburg Junior College a 56 thousand bits per                 
              second connection to the NSFNET, a high speed (1.5 - 45 million                
              bits per second) National Backbone network.                                    
                                                                                             
              The Colleges needs greater functionality and network speed to be               
              able to access supercomputers, libraries, and make file transfers              
              along with being able to implement a more reliable mail system.                
              Students and faculty research will benefit from the link.  This is             
              also a unique opportunity for the schools to explore innovative                
              educational resources.
