Abstract    :
              This award is the starter grant increment of Dr. Carreira's                    
              Postdoctoral Fellowship in Chemistry. The design and synthesis                 
              of structurally well-defined rare earth complexes for the                      
              asymmetric catalysis of the hetero-Diels-Alder cycloaddition                   
              reaction will be carried out. Systems to be studied include the                
              reactions of achiral aldehydes with funcionalized dienes.                      
              Protecting groups on the dienophile will provide a second                      
              contact point with the complex to enhance the selectivity of                   
              the formation of one diastereomeric transition state. These                    
              steric effects will lead  to increased product selectivity.                    
              %%%                                                                            
              The Diels Alder reaction is very versatile in the different                    
              kinds of molecules that can be prepared by it. This proposal                   
              will study means by which the reaction can be made more                        
              selective. The results will lead to the synthesis of new                       
              molecules some of which could have important physiological                     
              properties.
