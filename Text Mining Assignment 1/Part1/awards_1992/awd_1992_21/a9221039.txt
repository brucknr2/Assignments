Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This proposal strives to characterize the mechanism of                         
              dissolution and crystallization when a sparingly soluble salt                  
              is produced from the dissoultion of particulate material.  In                  
              particular, the work focuses on the intensification of tis                     
              prate process by the use of microphases.  The presence of very                 
                                                                                             
              small particles or crystallites has been recentl shown to                      
              enhance the rate of transport from one phase to another.  The                  
              unique aspect of this work is that no externally produced                      
              microphase will be added, and the reaction itself will produce                 
                                                                                             
              the microphase.                                                                
                                                                                             
              This process has been termed reaction crystallization; and it,                 
                                                                                             
              in turn, falls under a class of research called "process                       
              intensification".  It is part of a trend to approach                           
              crystallization studies from a reaction engineering point of                   
              view.  On additional challenge to develop theoretical analysis                 
                                                                                             
              of the complex interactions involved and then apply them to                    
              the design of dissolution - precipitation processes.
