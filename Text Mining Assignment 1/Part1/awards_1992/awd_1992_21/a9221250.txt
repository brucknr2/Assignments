Abstract    :
              The focus of this research is two-fold.  In the first area, the                
              use of intramolecular diyl trapping for the preparation of                     
              taxol-related compounds will be explored.  In the second area,                 
              the use of 1,3-diyls as partners in ?4+3! cycloadditions with                  
              1,3-dienes, intramolecular reactions involving cycloaddition to                
              cyclobutenones followed by fragmentation, and direct                           
              7-endo,trig cyclization reactions will be used to form                         
              compounds containing either seven or eight-membered rings.

              With this Renewal award, the Synthetic Organic Program is                      
              supporting the research of Dr. R. Daniel Little of the                         
              Department of Chemistry at the University of California, Santa                 
              Barbara.  Professor Little will focus his work on the                          
              development of diradical (diyl) trapping strategies for the                    
              synthesis of taxol-related systems and for the preparation of                  
              carbon compounds containing seven or eight-membered rings.
