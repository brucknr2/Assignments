Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This award will provide support for a broad program of                         
              extragalactic studies.                                                         
                                                                                             
              In the past, the Principal Investigator completed                              
              observations of redshifts of a  group of galaxies that had                     
              been observed by the Infrared Astronomy Satellite.  These                      
              observations will be continued, but approximately twice as                     
              many objects will now be observed.  He will also continue to                   
              do computer simulations of the formation of structure in the                   
              universe.  He also intends to initiate studies of the                          
              internal kinematics of distant galaxies in order to                            
              investigate the evolution of galaxies and clustering of                        
              galaxies.                                                                      
                                                                                             
              The Principal Investigator is regarded as a world authority                    
              on this subject.
