Abstract    :
                   Professor Kleppner and his group will pursue three major                  
              goals:  (1) to interpret the laser spectroscopy of Rydberg atoms               
              in magnetic fields in terms of classical chaos and to trace the                
              relationship between the classical and quantal description of the              
              electron motion, (2) determine the ground-state Lamb shift by                  
              making the world's most precise measurement of the Rydberg                     
              constant, using millimeter wave spectroscopy, (3) perform a                    
              precision measurement of the 1S-2S transition in hydrogen where                
              the width of the line due to kinetic motion of the atoms has been              
              vastly reduced by evaporatively cooling the sample.
