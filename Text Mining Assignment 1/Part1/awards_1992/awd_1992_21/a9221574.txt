Abstract    :
                   Rhodes College request support from NSF for connection of its             
              campus network to SURAnet.  SURAnet is the midlevel network located            
              in the southeastern United States.  It will provide operations                 
              management and information services and it will provide Rhodes                 
              College with a 56 thousand bits per second connection to the                   
              NSFNET, a high speed (1.5 - 45 million bits per second) National               
              Backbone network.                                                              
                   The University needs greater functionality and network speed              
              to be able to access supercomputers, libraries, and make file                  
              transfers along with being able to implement a more reliable mail              
              system.  Students and faculty research will benefit from the link.             
              This is also a unique opportunity for the school to explore                    
              innovative educational resources.
