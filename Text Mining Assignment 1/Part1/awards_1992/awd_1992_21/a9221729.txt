Abstract    :
                   Partial support is provided for travel and registration fees              
              to allow scientists from the former Soviet Union to attend the                 
              Second International Workshop on Materials Processing at High                  
              Gravity, to be held at Clarkson University in Potsdam, New York.               
              Centrifugation is proving to be a potentially important new tool               
              in processing of materials, particularly in the crystal growth of              
              semiconductor, superconductor, optical and detector materials.                 
              Currently, many surprising experimental results have been obtained             
              but not yet explained.  The conference follows the First                       
              International Workshop, which was organized and held at Dubna in               
              the United Soviet Socialist Republic in 1991 and for which                     
              Professor Regel was the prime organizer and chair.                             
                   If the growth of crystals under enhanced gravity fields can               
              be better understood, the potential exists for producing                       
              semiconductor and other crystals of superior quality.
