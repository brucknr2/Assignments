Abstract    :
              Theoretical research will be conducted to address problems in                  
              condensed matter physics which are concerned with explaining and               
              predicting the physical properties of a variety of interesting                 
              materials which are currently subjects for experimental studies and            
              technological promise.  The properties of these materials are so               
              unusual that new theoretical approaches and techniques are often               
              required.  These will be developed based primarily on the methods              
              of quantum statistical mechanics.  Thus research to be carried out             
              has both intrinsic theoretical importance and immediate                        
              experimental relevance.  The research will have impact on materials            
              science, solid state physics and quantum chemistry.                            
                                                                                             
              The materials which will be investigated in this project include:              
              new, strongly correlated metallic and magnetic materials; heavy-               
              fermion materials; high temperature superconductors; disordered                
              electronic substances; and, quantum solids and fluids.  In all of              
              these subjects, the interactions between the elementary                        
              constituents play a fundamental role.  The theoretical approach                
              will introduce and elaborate models and methods which deal directly            
              with that central issue.
