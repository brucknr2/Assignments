Abstract    :
              9221408  Albright  The objectives of this study are to understand and improve
              the  process of alkylating isobutane with light olefins using sulfuric  acid as
              a catalyst.  The reaction mixture is an emulsion consisting  of sulfuric acid
              and a liquid hydrocarbon mixture of isobutane,  olefins, and alkylate product
              (a mixture of isoparaffins with 5-12  carbon atoms).  Nature and rates of
              chemical and physical  transformations in the emulsion or across the interface
              are  determined.  Interfacial area will be measured by a novel method.  
              Kinetic models incorporating interfacial area are developed.   Approaches to
              increasing the interfacial area are examined,  including increased agitation,
              higher acid/hydrocarbon ratios, and  the use of surfactants or other additives.
                 Clean fuel considerations are increasing demand for alkylates as  fuel
              enhancers at the same time that environmental protection  considerations are
              forcing a phase-out of the most common catalyst  for producing them:  hydrogen
              fluoride.  This study is a new look  at an earlier generation of catalyst to
              see if improvements in the  process can make it competitive.  This is an
              industry-university  cooperative project with Stratco, Inc. of Leawood KS.
