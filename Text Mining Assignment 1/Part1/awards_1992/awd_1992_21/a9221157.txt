Abstract    :
                   The dynamics of plant communities have long been of interest              
              to ecologists, yet these dynamics are poorly understood.  Direct,              
              long-term observations of populations and communities are                      
              difficult, forcing the use of indirect methods to study community              
              stability and dynamics.  Given the potential anthropogenic                     
              changes in climate, the need for long-term, baseline data on                   
              forest community dynamics increases.  However, there are few                   
              areas with large, intact stands of old-growth forest available                 
              for long-term inventory and monitoring.       This research will               
              use existing data bases from two old-growth stands in northern                 
              Michigan to address hypotheses concerning the long-term stability              
              and dynamics of northern hardwood forests.                                     
              These data bases were initially collected by Forest Service                    
              personnel starting in 1934 for one stand, and 1961 in the other                
              stand.  These data will be combined with newly collected data                  
              sets on species growth rates, seedling establishment, sapling                  
              growth, and gap dynamics to test several hypotheses concerning                 
              the dynamics of old-growth forest communities.                                 
                   The participation of undergraduate students is a fundamental              
               component of the research program.  This research will involve                
              up to 20 undergraduate students over a four year period.                       
              Students will be involved with all components of the study form                
              project design and data collection, to data analysis and                       
              publication.  Overall, this project will provide and opportunity               
              to involve undergraduates in scientific research, as well as                   
              gather important long- and short-term data on the effects of                   
              climate change on old- growth forest dynamics.
