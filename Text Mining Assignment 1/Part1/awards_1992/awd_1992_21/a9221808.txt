Abstract    :
              9221808  Leonard       Numerical models of atmospheric processes are valuable
              tools  for producing operational forecasts and to assist researchers in 
              understanding fundamental interactions between various physical  processes.  An
              important component of any numerical model is the  accurate mathematical
              representation of atmospheric processes.  As  computer power has increased and
              the spatial resolution of  atmospheric forecast, climate and research models
              has improved, so  the need for more accurate numerical advection schemes has 
              increased in significance.  This is because higher spatial  resolution allows
              representation of sharper gradients and changes  in gradients.       The
              Principal Investigator will pursue the development of a  highly accurate,
              computationally efficient scheme for  advection-dominated flows typical of
              atmospheric processes.   Specific objectives include extending to three
              dimensions the  Principal Investigator's previous work on a third order, 
              one-dimensional advection scheme.  He also will investigate the  development of
              a multidimensional universal limiter.  Successful  completion of this research
              should result in improved  representations in numerical models of a variety of
              atmospheric  phenomena.  ***
