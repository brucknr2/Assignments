Abstract    :
              This project is in the general area of analytical and surface                  
              chemistry and in the subfield of heterogeneous photoprocesses.                 
              During the tenure of this three-year continuing grant, Professor               
              Lewis and his students will investigate structural and electronic              
              properties of semiconductor/liquid interfaces.  Using well-defined             
              semiconductor/liquid contacts, this research seeks insight into                
              those factors which control (a) electric fields in the                         
              semiconductor domain of the interface, (b) the rate at which                   
              charges move from the semiconductor phase into the contacting                  
              phase, and (c) the semiconductor/contacting phase surface                      
              chemistry.                                                                     
              %%%                                                                            
              Semiconductor/liquid contacts are important in many technologies               
              including solar energy conversion, photochemical remediation of                
              toxic wastes, chemical sensors, and molecular electronic devices.              
              The successful attainment of the goals of this research should                 
              result in the more efficient and widespread use of semiconductor               
              systems in the aforementioned and related technologies.
