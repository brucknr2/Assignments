Abstract    :
                   This research is being conducted by Dr. David M. Hillis, a                
              molecular biologist from the University of Texas.  Dr. Hillis is               
              well known for his studies relating to DNA sequence analysis.  The             
              current research is a natural extension of Dr. Hillis' past work               
              and represents a major innovation, linking the utilization of                  
              parallel computers with a need for the development of more                     
              efficient software for analyzing the increasing amount of                      
              nucleotide sequence data.  Software for DNA sequence analysis is               
              being modified and developed for massively parallel computers in an            
              effort to increase computation speed and enhance the assessment of             
              available computer algorithms.  Supercomputer manufacturers are                
              currently emphasizing massively parallel architecture, and even                
              smaller highly parallel computers are under production and/or                  
              developed.  The development of software for biological analysis                
              will contribute to both the scientific community and the newly                 
              emerging parallel computer industry.
