Abstract    :
              This grant is for travel support for scientists from                           
              the former Soviet Union to attend the Fifth                                    
              International Vacuum Microelectronics Conference,                              
              in Vienna, Austria, July 13-15, 1992.  The Vacuum                              
              Microelectronics Conference provides a focused                                 
              scientific forum to address research topics in this                            
              relatively new and emerging technological field.                               
              The scope of the conference includes fundamental                               
              theoretical and experimental physics in such topics                            
              as non-equilibrium electron transport in 3-D                                   
              nanostructures, quantum mechanical tunneling                                   
              through thin surface layers of insulators, metals,                             
              and semiconductors, and theoretical descriptions of                            
              surface tunneling.  It also includes the physics of                            
              field emission from layered materials and                                      
              fabrication and processing physics of                                          
              nanostructures, and the physics and chemistry of                               
              micromachining.  For a number of years, scientists                             
              from the former Soviet Union have been leaders in                              
              this field, and their participation is considered to be                        
              central to the success of the conference, considering                          
              their contributions to the field with respect to                               
              creativity, technical merit, and scientific                                    
              significance.  However, the recent events in the                               
              FSU have left their institutes without resources to                            
              provide travel to the conference even for their                                
              leading researchers.  The request to NSF to provide                            
              travel funds to bring many of these leading                                    
              scientists to the meeting is highly appropriate at                             
              this time, given the turbulent economic situation in                           
              the FSU and our desire to foster closer contact                                
              with quality scientific groups in these countries.                             
              The funds requested of NSF will be dispersed by                                
              the International Committee based on a priority                                
              listing of up to 20 scientists attached to this                                
              proposal.
