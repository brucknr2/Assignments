Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Collisions and mergers seem to have played a major role in                     
              determining the shapes and dynamics of present-day galaxies.                   
              A few mergers are still occurring and offer valuable clues                     
              to past evolutionary processes.  Dating ancient mergers has                    
              become feasible because of the discovery of merger                             
              signatures such as ripples, tails, X-structures, and oddly                     
              rotating cores in earlytype galaxies.                                          
                                                                                             
              The research to be carried out in this grant will be a                         
              program of observational research aimed at studying the                        
              process of collisions and mergers of galaxies.                                 
                                                                                             
              The Principal Investigator is regarded as a world leader in                    
              this research area.
