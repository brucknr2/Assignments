Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The goal of this Small Grant for Exploratory Research is to                    
              develop a reliable and sensitive push-pull perfusion technique to              
              examine the physiological mechanisms of naturally-induced                      
              infertility in female Callitrichid Monkeys.  Many species of                   
              these primates are highly endangered.  In their specialized                    
              social system, subordinate females in groups in the wild and in                
              the laboratory are kept infertile.  Ovulation in subordinate                   
              females is suppressed while these females remain in the presence               
              of a dominant female and help raise their offspring.  Dr. Abbott               
              has demonstrated that the physiological mechanism maintaining the              
              infertile state of these subordinate females resides within the                
              hypothalamic region of the brain.  He will now develop a                       
              sophisticated technical procedure to measure neurotransmitters                 
              and hypothalamic hormones in the hypothalamus.  The results will               
              lead to a better understanding of how the social environment                   
              engages specific neural mechanisms to regulate female fertility.               
              This could provide a better foundation for the development of                  
              reproductive techniques to accelerate the breeding of these rare               
              monkeys in captivity and to improve the planning and management                
              of re-introduction programs as well as improve the management of               
              the remaining small number of monkeys living in the wilds of                   
              South American.
