Abstract    :
              The study involves the consideration of a theory of dialogue  with  meta-control
               features  that  previous  research  have  indicated   as   desirable   for 
              improved   efficiency   in  human-machine   voice-interactions.  In  
              particular   these  features include: (1) process meta-statements which
              overview  and report progress in the interaction; (2) an automatically  set 
              level  of  initiative in the system;  and  (3)  perform  dialogue  corrections 
              and  automatic  adjustment  of  other  parameters.  The  first  feature  serves
               the   purpose   of  informing  the user of the system's intentions to 
              encourage  cooperation,  educating  the  user  about  the  process   of 
              debugging,  and  maintaining morale to maximize  efficiency.  The  second 
              feature enables the system to take  charge  and  lead  the  interaction  when
              the user  lacks  the  knowledge  required and to release control to the user
              when he  or  she  has  sufficient  expertise. The third is  used  to  optimize 
              aspects   of  system  performance.  The  effects  of   these  meta-behaviors 
              in human-human dialogues on  the  efficiency  and  educational  value of the
              exchange are also  considered  with views toward their implementation in
              automatic dialogue  systems.
