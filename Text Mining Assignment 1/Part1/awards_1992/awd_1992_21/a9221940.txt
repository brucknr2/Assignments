Abstract    :
              9221940  MCKOON    This research concerns reading and the ways information in
              memory  can contribute to the inference processes that occur during  reading. 
              One source of information for inference processes is  short-term memory for
              parts of a text that have already been read.   This information should be
              available to allow, for example,  inferences that decide the correct referent
              of a pronoun or  inferences that relate via causality two events described by
              the  text. Experiments will examine the local representation constructed  for a
              text, testing the theoretical proposition that locally  available information
              is structured by the linguistic, semantic,  and pragmatic means by which the
              information is expressed.  A  second line of research will examine interactions
              between inference  processes and well-known information from long-term memory, 
              examining knowledge of the semantic structures of verbs, knowledge  of what
              concepts are frequently associated with each other, and  knowledge about how
              lexical items are used in various contexts.    ***
