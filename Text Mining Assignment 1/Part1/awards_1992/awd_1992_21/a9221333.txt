Abstract    :
              The main thrust of this research concerns computer simulations of              
              biological molecules.  A new class of Monte Carlo simulations has              
              been developed by the principal investigator which (slightly)                  
              relaxes the usual Markovian constraint to enable greatly improved              
              efficiency for systems with important inhomogeneity and local                  
              anisotropy.  These new and quite general methods will be used to               
              investigate models of biological molecules.  The research will                 
              study equilibrium fluctuations of such molecules and continue work             
              on the protein folding problem.  Calculations of free-energy                   
              differences and potentials of mean force will be carried out using             
              multiple histogram techniques developed by the principal                       
              investigator.  Another important area of application is the                    
              determination of the structure of biological molecules from x-ray              
              scattering.  One of the most effective current methods of                      
              optimizing the fit of the structure of x-ray data involves                     
              simulated annealing with molecular dynamics.  The application of               
              new Monte Carlo simulation methods has promise of improving the                
              efficiency of some of these structure determinations.                          
                                                                                             
              The award is funded jointly by the Materials Theory program in the

              Resources.                                                                     
              %%%                                                                            
              This computational research will focus on algorithm development for            
              Monte Carlo simulation and applications to problems of biological              
              importance.  Simulations will be done on the behavior of biological            
              molecules and the folding of proteins.  The research has great                 
              potential should these new Monte Carlo simulations be shown to be              
              competitive with conventional molecular dynamics techniques.  The              
              research is jointly funded by the Materials Theory program and the             
              Computational Biology Activity.
