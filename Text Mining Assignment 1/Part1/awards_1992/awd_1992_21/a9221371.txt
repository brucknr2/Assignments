Abstract    :
              This project in the Theoretical and Computational Chemistry                    
              Program of the Division of Chemistry involves the theoretical                  
              investigation of the general rotational and vibrational                        
              dynamics of symmetric polyatomic molecules, with particular                    
              emphasis on the gas-phase buckminsterfullerenes and their                      
              isotopic variants.  Considerable use is being made both of                     
              group-theoretic techniques and computer-graphic generation of                  
              rotational energy surfaces.  Predictions are being made about                  
              the high-resolution spectra of these molecules.

              The newly-discovered "bucky-ball" molecule containing 60 carbon                
              atoms is remarkable for its highly symmetrical and nearly                      
              spherical structure.  In this project sophisticated                            
              mathematical techniques and computer graphics are being used to                
              characterize the spinning motions of the molecule and their                    
              interactions with light.
