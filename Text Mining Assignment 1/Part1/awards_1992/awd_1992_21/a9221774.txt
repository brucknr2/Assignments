Abstract    :
              9221774  Talcott  Cultural cross-fertilization and inspiration are very
              important  for research.  The research theme, Semantics-Based Program 
              Manipulation, has a strong potential to put program development  on a more
              automated basis.  This area's active research  communities on each side of the
              Atlantic are sufficiently small  that nearly all have heard of each other's
              viewpoints.  Longer  and more direct contacts are useful and needed, to open
              new ways  of looking at old problems, and suggest new applications and 
              problems for study.    This award would support an international collaboration
              that  would strengthen already-existing research contacts, increase  exchange
              of ideas and personnel, and promote synergy among  university research groups
              with closely related research  interests at six European and eight American
              institutions. It  takes advantage of a diversity of technical expertise in a
              way  impossible without such an intense interaction.  It is expected  to result
              in wider accessibility of results initially through  wider use within the
              community.  More rapid development of  emerging technology is anticipated from
              the interaction of  researchers with diverse expertise and common goals.  ***
