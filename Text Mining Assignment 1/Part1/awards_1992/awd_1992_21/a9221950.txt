Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                                                                                            
              Trace elements are those not found in large abundance in the                   
              atmosphere, hydrosphere or geosphere, yet they are important                   
              tracers of biogeochemical processes, and many are required for                 
              life, particularly in the marine environment.  Pioneers such as                
              Clair C. Patterson were among the first to obtain the accurate data            
              necessary for proper interpretation of these elements.  In honor of            
              Professor Patterson's achievements in this field, and on the event             
              of his retirement, a symposium is hereby proposed which will focus             
              on trace element biogeochemistry in the global environment.  The               
              symposium will take place on December 3-4, 1992, at California                 
              Institute of Technology.  Approximately 24 distinguished                       
              biogeochemists will be invited to present keynote talks.  These                
              talks will be supplemented by a research poster session which will             
              be open the scientific community.  The symposium format will allow             
              ample time for discussion of the progress and future in trace                  
              element biogeochemistry, and proceedings will be published in a                
              peer-reviewed journal dedicated to the symposium.  The symposium               
              will be unique in its comprehensive view of trace element                      
              biogeochemistry and its cycles among the major spheres of the                  
              earth.
