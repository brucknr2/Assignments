Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Growth, molting and regeneration in crustaceans is controlled by               
              steroid hormones (ecdysteroids) from a pair of glands (Y-organs) in            
              the body cavity. The Y-organs in turn are regulated by a protein               
              hormone (MIH) from the brain. This system is comparable to human               
              glands (testis, ovary, adrenal) that secrete steroid hormones                  
              (testosterone, estrogen, cortisone) and are controlled by protein              
              hormones from pituitary and brain. We have found that crustaceans,             
              like humans, make steroid hormones from cholesterol. Accordingly,              
              we use crustacean glands as a simplified model to study how                    
              cholesterol enters cells and is converted to hormones, and how the             
              process is regulated by the external proteins. We already know that            
              all cholesterol in crustacean blood is bound to high-density                   
              lipoprotein (HDL), and that there are receptors on the surface of              
              Y-organ that recognize and bind the HDL. Using radioactively                   
              labeled cholesterol and HDL, the electron microscope and the                   
              ultracentrifuge, we now will find how cholesterol enters the cells,            
              how it is processed if still bound to HDL and where in the cells               
              the processing takes place. Part of the study is to determine how              
              MIH controls cholesterol entry; e.g., does MIH change the number of            
              receptors for HDL? We will also attempt to work out the details of             
              the biosynthesis of ecdysteroids, by using the mass spectrograph to            
              identify the individual steps in the conversion of cholesterol to              
              the hormones. This project embraces the fields of neurobiology,                
              endocrinology and development in addressing basic questions on                 
              neuroendocrine coordination of functions.
