Abstract    :
              Dr. Ilan Benjamin is supported by a grant from the Theoretical                 
              and Computational Chemistry Program to perform theoretical                     
              studies of transport, adsorption, and chemical reactions which                 
              occur at liquid-vapor interfaces.  He is using molecular                       
              dynamics simulations to gain insight into the solvation free                   
              energy and adsorption which takes place at the water                           
              liquid-vapor interface, and the effect which this interface has                
              on the equilibrium constant and free energy of activation for                  
              various chemical processes such as isomerization equilibrium,                  
              unimolecular decomposition and electron transfer.  He is                       
              developing new methodologies for performing such simulations                   
              which include treating the long range coulombic forces by a                    
              combination of Ewald summation and reaction field techniques.

              One of the most challenging and important problems in chemistry                
              is to understand at the molecular level the effect of the                      
              medium on chemical reactions which occur at the interfacial                    
              region bewtween different phases.  Recent advances in very fast                
              time-resolved spectroscopic techniques are yielding new data on                
              solvent effects on dynamical processes in bulk solution and at                 
              interfaces.  The theoretical research being performed by Dr.                   
              Benjamin employs computer simulations based on molecular models                
              to gain a deeper molecular level understanding of the physical                 
              and chemical processes which take place at the liquid-vapor                    
              interface.
