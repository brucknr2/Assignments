Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The international Union for Pure and Applied Biophysics will hold              
              its 11th International Biophysics Congress and General Assembly in             
              Budapest, Hungary, in July, 1993.  Biophysics is the application of            
              the laws of physics and chemistry to the understanding of the                  
              fundamental mechanism of life.  It concentrates on subcellular and             
              highly quantitative general questions.  Many disciplines, including            
              medicine, chemistry, neurology, cell physiology, physics and                   
              microscopy overlap to form the biophysical science community.

              The International Biophysics Congress is the largest and most                  
              comprehensive international meeting in the field of biophysics                 
              research.  The Congresses are highly regarded for the quality and              
              scope of their programs.  The scientific program offers symposia on            
              topics of current interest and scientists of international                     
              reputation have been selected to serve as invited participants.                
              The standing of U.S. scientists in this field is well known and                
              respected and it is important that they attend to learn from and               
              discuss their research experiences with experts from all over the              
              world.
