Abstract    :
                 The role of biological interactions in determining the abundance,           
              distribution and persistence of rare plants, and their vulnerability to        
              environmental stress, is poorly known. This study will analyze the             
              consequences of competition and seed predation on the population               
              dynamics of a federally-listed threatened species, Cirsium pitcheri.The        
              proposed research will use field experiments to reduce the impact of           
              biological factors and interactions along a climatic gradient in the           
              dune systems around Lake Michigan. The results of this study will              
              provide critical baseline information on plant population dynamics of          
              a threatened species. In addition, results from this work will                 
              contribute to developing useful conservation and management protocols          
              for rare and endangered plant species.
