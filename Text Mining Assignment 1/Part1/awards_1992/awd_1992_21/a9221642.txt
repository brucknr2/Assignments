Abstract    :
              Using 13 years of SRS-sponsored attitudinal data, the PI will use              
              multivariate analyses to identify important independent variables              
              to explain attentiveness and other concepts of interest to the                 
              program.  Further, the project will explore possible changes over              
              time in these variables, with particular emphasis on male/female               
              differences in attentiveness to science and how the explanatory                
              variables for these differences may be changing.
