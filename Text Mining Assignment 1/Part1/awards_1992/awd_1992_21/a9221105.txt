Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              It is proposed to augment the Infrared Spatial Interferometer which            
              has been built and is operating on Mount Wilson  so that it can do             
              interferometry on spectral lines.  Since the system uses heterodyne            
              detection, it can provide very sensitive detection at narrow                   
              bandwidths and hence can be conveniently adapted to spectral work.             
              Prominent molecular spectral lines of gases recently emitted by                
              stars and in their surrounding dust shells have already been                   
              studied by heterodyne detection in the 10 micron region.  It is                
              proposed here to enhance the ISI so that it can carry out spatial              
              interferometry at high angular resolutions on these and other                  
              spectral lines as well as on continuum radiation, with which it now            
              works.  The work involves installation of two sets of carefully                
              matched IF filters for the two telescopes, IF switching, and IF                
              chopping between filters.  It will also involve field work in                  
              testing the system and its use, so that techniques can be checked              
              and perfected, and initial results of high quality obtained.  This             
              work can open up a new aspect of spatial interferometry and provide            
              new, highly specific information on molecular formation and                    
              excitation, as well as distribution of gas densities, temperatures,            
              and accelerations.
