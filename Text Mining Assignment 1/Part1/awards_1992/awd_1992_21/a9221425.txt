Abstract    :
              This project is an analysis of the rate of production and                      
              dissolution of biogenic silica in the uppermost 150 meters of the              
              Ross Sea, and is part of a coordinated study of the biogenic silica            
              and organic carbon cycling in the water column and the sediments of            
              the Ross Sea.  The data base for the study was obtained from                   
              dedicated cruises of the R/V Polar Duke in 1990 and in 1992.                   
                                                                                             
              The antarctic deep sea and continental shelf environment is the                
              major repository for silica accumulation in the global ocean, and              
              dominates the global silica budget.  The Ross Sea is a particularly            
              anomalous area in which large amounts of biogenic silica are                   
              accumulating in modern sediments, while the surface production                 
              rates are generally below the global average.  Moreover the usual              
              similarity between the oceanic silicon and carbon cycle does not               
              hold around Antarctica, and the two cycles are decoupled in that               
              the rate of particulate carbon deposition in the modern sediment is            
              very low.  The analysis phase will concentrate on three sites,                 
              identified in the field phase, at which the biogenic silica and                
              organic carbon content differed by two or three orders of                      
              magnitude.                                                                     
                                                                                             
              The objectives of the project are to quantify the variability of               
              silica production and dissolution rates in these sites of                      
              silica-rich and silica-poor surface sediments through isotope mass             
              spectrometry of the samples obtained on the 1991-92 cruise, and to             
              produce an integrated surface silica budget that will be combined              
              with vertical flux data and sediment accumulation data to be                   
              obtained by the cooperating investigators.
