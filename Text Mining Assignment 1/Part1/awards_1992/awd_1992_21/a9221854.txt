Abstract    :
                 9221854   Gilbert    A nerve cell in the sensory cortex of the brain is
              activated by  stimuli that lie within a certain spatial area, called the 
              "receptive field" of the cell.  Evidence from work on the sense of  touch on
              the body surface (somatosensory system) has shown that  these receptive fields
              in adults are surprisingly dynamic in  location and size, rather than having
              fixed characteristics for a  given cell.  Active sensory experience is
              important for defining  the receptive field; a loss of sensation from the
              peripheral area  reduces the size of receptive fields of cortical cells for
              that  area, and persistent stimulation leads to an increase.  Recent  efforts
              have been to establish how connections in the neuronal  pathway are modified
              when these plastic changes occur.  This study  is a novel application that
              parallels somatosensory approach, but  uses the visual cortex to exploit known
              details of the visual  pathway and intracortical connections.  Here, changes in
              receptive  fields in the visual system are studied when part of the visual 
              field is made invisible (a scotoma).  Anatomy and pharmacology will  be used to
              examine connections to and within the cortex, to  differentiate the
              contributions of such connections in the cortical  dynamics.  These studies
              will help elucidate the mechanisms of  integrating information across space,
              and of cortical memory; the  emphasis is on visual processing, but the results
              will have impact  beyond visual neuroscience to sensory neuroscience in
              general, and  to cognitive neuroscience.  ***
