Abstract    :
              This project will improve the housing and curation of the mammal               
              research collection (182,000 specimens; third largest in US) in                
              concert with a planned relocation of the collection to new                     
              facilities.  Specific improvements will involve: (1) replacing                 
              older inadequate storage cases and wet-specimen containers; (2)                
              adding new cases to accommodate past and anticipated growth.   The             
              institution will expend 80 million to renovate the new facility for            
              occupancy by the Museum of Vertebrate Zoology, Museum of                       
              Paleontology, and the University & Jepson Herbaria.  Renovations               
              include a doubling of MVZ collection space and installation of                 
              temperature and humidity controls.  The University will also assume            
              all costs of collection relocation.  This support will provide much            
              better access to the collection for research scientists and                    
              students and will further the preservation and use of the                      
              collection in biodiversity research.

              This project will improve the conservation and accessibility of                
              the mammal research collection at the University of California,                
              Berkeley, by replacing antiquated inadequate cases and by                      
              accommodating space for collection growth.  This improvement will              
              occur in concert with a move of the collection to new facilities               
              and will increase the access to the collection by research                     
              scientists and students involved in biodiversity projects.
