Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The goal of this work is to prepare solid-state inorganic oxides,              
              phosphate fluorides, and fluorides that may find use as optical                
              frequency converters and laser crystals.  Preparative work with                
              frequency converters involves the develpment of crystal chemistry              
              of selected borates.  The understanding of these materials are                 
              advanced with the computation of microscopic hyperpolarizabilities             
              (beta) from macroscopic d coefficients and continuing applications             
              of the anionic group theory.  Work with laser hosts focuses on the             
              development of materials in the STACK family and synthesis of new              
              phosphate fluorides and fluorides.  The synthesis of these                     
              materials should provide a variety of new crystals for study in                
              diode-pumped or high cross-section, high-power laser systems.

              The objective of this work is to synthesize and study new solid-               
              state ceramics that may be used as laser crystals or optical                   
              second-harmonic generators.  Simple concepts in reaction and                   
              crystal chemistry are implemented in designing or selecting new                
              materials that have suitable optical characteristics and can be                
              grown as large single crystals.  Optical studies of these materials            
              provides the basis for testing and developing the applicability of             
              the concepts and materials themselves.  The realization of                     
              materials having superior characteristics may well afford new                  
              sources of high-power laser light for applications ranging from                
              industrial manufacturing to the generation of x-rays for living-               
              cell holography.
