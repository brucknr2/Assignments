Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  Interpreting the locomotor behavior of ancestral primates                 
              relies primarily upon the ability to predict adaptive function from            
              fossil bones.  Such predictions follow from morphological                      
              comparisons of skeletons of extant primates for which behavior in              
              the wild is reasonably well documented.  The objective of this                 
              proposal is to isolate variables in muscular architecture, and                 
              their correlates in the bony skeleton, that can distinguish                    
              arboreal from terrestrial quadrupeds (in this particular case, two             
              very closely related primate species of guenon monkeys, C. aethiops            
              and C. ascanius).  This will provide clearer insights into the                 
              locomotor adaptations of fossil primates.
