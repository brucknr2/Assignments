Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  The dissolution of novolak polymers and other hydroxylic                  
              resins will be studied in terms of a molecular model where the rate            
              of dissolution is controlled by percolative diffusion of base into             
              the solid matrix.  The percolation theory provides a scaling law               
              for the dependence of dissolution rate on the concentration of                 
              hydrophilic sites (hydroxyl groups).  The materials to be studied              
              will be novolak resins from mixtures of o-cresol and p-cresol, and             
              copolymers of hexafluorodimethylhydroxystyrene and styrene.                    
                                                                                             
              Dissolution inhibition of novolak and other resins is the basis of             
              the most important imaging materials in the semiconductor industry.            
              Yet the nature of this phenomenon is incompletely understood.  This            
              research aims to provide an explanation in terms of the                        
              hydrophilic-hydrophobic balance in these resins.
