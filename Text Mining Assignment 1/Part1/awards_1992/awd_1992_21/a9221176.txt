Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This action supports a phase transformation conference to address              
              the controversial roles of shear and diffusion in the formation of             
              plates that are not the product of a martensitic transformation.               
              The conference will be held in Hawaii, 18-22 Dec 1992.  The                    
              conference site was selected to enable a wide selection of                     
              participants.  Transmission electron microscopy and analytical                 
              microscopy offer new information on this type of phase                         
              transformation.  Critical experiments are covered and recent                   
              evidence argued.  The conference creates a framework that                      
              incorporates several features of the current possible                          
              transformation mechanisms.  The Proceedings of the conference are              
              to be published in the archival literature.

              Phase transformations are inherent to the development of                       
              appropriate microstructures in engineering metallic alloys.  This              
              conference addresses a type of transformation common to both                   
              ferrous and nonferrous alloys.
