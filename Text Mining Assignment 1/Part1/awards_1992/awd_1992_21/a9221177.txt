Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Three research areas will be pursued: (1) New photochemical                    
              reactions that proceed by way of alkyl propargyl,                              
              alpha-acyl-substituted alkyl propargyl, or acyl propargyl                      
              biradicals will be explored. This study will include a                         
              consideration of the multiplicity of the biradical intermediates               
              and the consequences to the course of reaction. (2) Independent                
              preparation of carbonyl-substituted biradicals that are                        
              intermediates in intramolecular ?2+2!- photocyclization will be                
              carried out. (3) The role of triplet energy and specific structure             
              on the selectivity of hydrogen abstraction by heteroaromatic                   
              nitrogen triplets will be investigated. Intramolecular abstraction             
              of primary, secondary, and tertiary nitrogen in pyridines,                     
              pyrimidines, and pyrazines will be studied.                                    
              %%%                                                                            
              This grant from the Organic Dynamics Program supports the                      
              continuing work of Professor William C. Agosta at Rockefeller                  
              University. Molecules that contain a light absorbing group, and in             
              addition, a carbon-carbon double and triplet bond will be                      
              irradiated. The intermediates in these reactions will be                       
              investigated by observing the final products of the reactions.                 
              These intermediates will be generated by other methods to provide              
              more insight into the electronic state and nature of the                       
              intermediates. The role of energetics of excited states and                    
              structure of certain nitrogen containing molecules in the                      
              intramolecular transfer of a hydrogen will be studied as well.
