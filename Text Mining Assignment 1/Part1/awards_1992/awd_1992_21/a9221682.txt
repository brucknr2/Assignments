Abstract    :
              This Presidential Young Investigator Award from the Inorganic,                 
              Bioinorganic, and Organometallic Chemistry Program supports                    
              research in biologically relevant inorganic chemistry.  The                    
              emphasis of the project is the elucidation of the role of metal                
              ions in important biological transformations.  Of particular                   
              interest is the participation of transition metal ions in the                  
              terminal steps of the reduction of dioxygen by cytochrome                      
              oxidase and the evolution of oxygen by the photosynthetic                      
              apparatus.  Small molecule analogs of the metal centers of                     
              these and other metalloproteins, especially                                    
              manganese-containing proteins, will be synthesized and                         
              characterized.  The general strategy involves the design and                   
              synthesis of organic ligands, preparation and purification of                  
              their complexes with transition metals, and thorough                           
              characterization of such systems by a variety of structural,                   
              magnetic, and spectroscopic techniques.  In addition to the                    
              systems mentioned above, others of interest include the                        
              magnetically-coupled siroheme and diron-sulfur cluster in                      
              sulfite reductase, and the participaton of nickel in                           
              hydrogenase and methanogenesis activity.  Finally, the role of                 
              low valent vanadium in catalyzing the conversion of dinitrogen                 
              to ammonia and hydrazine will be explored.  Comparison of the                  
              spectroscopic and chemical properties of the model compounds is                
              expected to yield valuable insight into the detailed workings                  
              of the modeled biological systems.
