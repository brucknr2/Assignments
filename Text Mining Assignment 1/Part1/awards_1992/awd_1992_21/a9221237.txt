Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Ages, Kinematics, and Chemistry of Stellar Populations.                        
                                                                                             
              The relationships of the Galaxy's stellar populations remain a                 
              puzzle.  Kinematically biased programs, even with the detailed                 
              modeling to be completed during the award period, do justice to hot            
              populations like the Galactic halo but not to cool disk                        
              populations.  Thus, a program begun in 1991 will be carried to                 
              completion in the solar neighborhood wherein Dr. Carney, together              
              with Dr. John Laird at Bowling Green University, will identify                 
              several thousand G dwarf stars, then determine accurate radial                 
              velocities and metallicities to test the discrete versus continuum             
              models of the thick disk and thin disk populations.  The study and             
              use of synthetic spectra will be extended into the infrared in                 
              anticipation of future chemistry versus kinematics studies                     
              throughout the disk.                                                           
                                                                                             
              Recent age estimates of the oldest globular clusters are                       
              inconsistent with the expansion ages implied by the popularly                  
              favored large Hubble constants, independent of the local mass                  
              density parameter.  For more accurate ages of globular clusters,               
              more work is required on the abundance of oxygen in halo stars.                
              A test of the halo distance scale will be performed using a maximum            
              likelihood statistical parallax analysis of 500 metal-poor stars.              
              Lithium abundances in single halo stars with a wide range of                   
              effective temperature will be derived to probe Big Bang                        
              nucleosynthesis.
