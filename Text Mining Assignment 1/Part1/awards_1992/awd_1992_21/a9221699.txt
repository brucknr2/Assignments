Abstract    :
              The validity of fluid equations as approximation to kinetic                    
              equations depends on whether there is a sufficiently accurate                  
              closure of the hierarchy of velocity moments of the kinetic                    
              equations.  We propose to use satellite measurements of particle               
              distribution functions to look for closure relations in the                    
              magnetosheath and magnetopause, thereby providing observational                
              evidence for deciding when a fluid plasma model is appropriate for             
              those regions.  Those regions are of particular interest because it            
              is known that they are highly turbulent, more turbulent than the               
              solar wind, and it is by no means clear that a turbulent plasma                
              will obey a closed set of fluid equations.  Moreover, turbulence in            
              the magnetosheath is a topic of great interest in the space                    
              community and it is largely not understood.  The plasma there may              
              exhibit several differing turbulent states and it is very important            
              to find out which of these, if any at all, can be described as a               
              fluid.
