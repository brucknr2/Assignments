Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This award will provide support for a broad program of                         
              observations to be made with the Palomar and Keck telescopes in                
              order to use the absorption lines in the spectra of quasars to                 
              study the evolution of intergalactic clouds and the interstellar               
              gas in galaxies from their origin to the present epoch.  Very                  
              high resolution spectra will be obtained of a sample of very                   
              distant quasars in order to make detailed studies of the                       
              absorption spectra produced by the light from these quasars                    
              passing through intervening galaxies and intergalactic clouds.                 
              The results from these studies will be used to study the physical              
              nature of these clouds.                                                        
                                                                                             
              The Principal Investigator is regarded as a world authority on                 
              this subject.
