Abstract    :
                   This research will focus on a geometric approach to                       
              mathematical problems of harmonic analysis.  The geometry and                  
              symmetry structure of a manifold determine a priori analytic                   
              inequalities for the natural operators that characterize analysis              
              on function spaces over the manifold.  These include the Fourier               
              transform, Green's functions and the Laplace-Beltrami operator.                
              The work seeks to develop and understand analysis on Lie groups and            
              Riemannian manifolds through the study of differential operators,              
              singular integrals and variational problems intrinsic to the                   
              manifold. Principal directions are (1) the role of renormalization             
              arguments in controlling the behavior of oscillatory phenomena and             
              (2) geometric analysis of higher-order multilinear differential                
              operators with tensor structure. Central to this research is the               
              interplay between geometric structure of manifolds and harmonic                
              analysis of the operators using conformal invariance and geometric             
              symmetrization.  Sharp constants for variational problems provide              
              a rich source of geometric and probabilistic information.                      
                   Insight into the mathematical framework is gained from exact              
              model calculations in conformal string theory and statistical                  
              mechanics using the conformal symmetry of critical phenomena.                  
              Computation analysis, especially computation and computer graphics,            
              is used to provide intuition and strategy for problems where the               
              geometric structure is too complex for elementary analysis.
