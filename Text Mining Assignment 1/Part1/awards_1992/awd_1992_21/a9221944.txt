Abstract    :
              This is a proposal for Workshop on Variable                                    
              Structure Control and Sliding Mode to be held in                               
              Cleveland, Ohio, October, l992.  The formal                                    
              introduction of variable structure systems and                                 
              notion of sliding modes in control theory were first                           
              introduced by Professor Utkin of Russia in 1960.                               
              Since then many industrial applications in power                               
              systems, automotive control, and biological systems                            
              have been reported.  The purpose of the workshop                               
              is to examine the current status of variable                                   
              structure systems related research , to identify                               
              practical engineering issues, and to explore future                            
              research directions.  The workshop is co-sponsored                             
              by Ohio Aerospace Institute.
