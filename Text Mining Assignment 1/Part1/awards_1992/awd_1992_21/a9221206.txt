Abstract    :
              9221206  Gutowski       This award provides travel support for graduate students
              and  the invited speakers to allow their participation in a Stanstead  Seminar
              devoted to the subject of the role of extratropical  dynamics in maintaining
              the climate.  The seminar will be held at  Bishop's University in Quebec in
              June 1993.  Among the topics to be  covered are extratropical energy and water
              cycles, the role of eddy  dynamics in zonally symmetric climate change, the
              contribution of  local dynamics associated with phenomena such as storm tracks
              to  non-zonal climate change, land-surface and tropical influences on 
              extratropical transports and general circulation model  predictability of the
              extratropical atmosphere handling of climate  change.       Funds for this
              award are being provided by three agencies -  NOAA, DOE, and NSF.  ***
