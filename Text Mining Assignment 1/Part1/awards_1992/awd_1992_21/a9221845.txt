Abstract    :
              9221845  Trigo    Abkhaz, a Northwest Caucasian language spoken in Turkey and
              the  Georgians S.S.R. is typologically anomalous in that it exhibits  an
              extraordinarily complex consonantal inventory.   Morphologically, it is an
              ergative language in which virtually  the entire syntactic structure of the
              clause is capitulated in  the verbal complex.  It contains several grammatical
              subsystems  that interact with each other in ways that are relevant to 
              theories of sound patterning (morpho-phonology) and sound  realization
              (phonetics).  The grammar of Abkhaz has been well  described, but descriptive
              and theoretical work on the above  topics has been superficial and of limited
              access.  Moreover,  present demographics and political conditions in Georgia
              and  Turkey pose a significant threat to the language of the Abkhaz.    The
              Principal Investigator will work with her consultant of the  last two years and
              with two additional speakers to transcribe,  analyze, gloss, and translate new
              and existing data.  In  addition, the PI will record and analyze the acoustic
              properties  of the various sounds of the language.  The PI will also 
              investigate specific linguistic hypotheses about the grammar of  Abkhaz based
              on the analyzed corpus of data.  This will culminate  in a volume describing
              the sound system and morpho-phonology of  Abkhaz.   ***
