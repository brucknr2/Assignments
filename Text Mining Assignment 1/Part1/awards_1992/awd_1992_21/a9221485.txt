Abstract    :
                   Olympic College is establishing a connection to NSFNET via a              
              56,000 bits per second line through the NorthWestNet mid-level                 
              network.  The connection enables the school's faculty and students             
              to communicate and collaborate with the international scientific               
              and educational community, and to access network resources such as             
              libraries, databases and supercomputers.  This award funds part of             
              the  costs for two years.
