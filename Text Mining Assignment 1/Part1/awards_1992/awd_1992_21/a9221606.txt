Abstract    :
                   This project is an international collaboration in glass                   
              research between the Industry/University Cooperative Research                  
              Center for Glass Research at Alfred University and the HVG- a glass            
              research institute in Germany.  This project implements an                     
              Industry/University/Government Cooperative Research Program between            
              the United States and Germany.  The ultimate objective of this                 
              joint effort is to couple the glass research expertise at Alfred               
              University with the glass research institute in Germany to conduct             
              Advanced Glass Processing research which will benefit the industry             
              members in both Centers.  The research projects at Alfred                      
              University will investigate the effects of Dealkalization on                   
              Surface-Related Mechanical Properties of Alkali Silicate Glasses,              
              the Denist, Wetting Behavior of Glass in Controlled Atmospheres,               
              and the Reflectometry Measurement of Thin Film Amorphous Films.                
              The research projects in Germany will examine the impact of small              
              chemical additions, basicity and oxidation state on the structure              
              and properties of silicate glass melts.  These factors strongly                
              influence the glassmaking process.                                             
                   The Deutsche Forshungs Gemeinschaft (DFG) will fund $220,000              
              per year for three years for the research projects at HVG.  The                
              research projects at Alfred University will be supported by the New            
              York State Legislature at $33,000 per year for three years, DOE                
              (through the Westinghouse Savannah River Co..) at $195,000 for                 
              three years, and the Industry/University Center for Glass Research             
              at Alfred University at $50,000 per year for three years.                      
                   This project is being cost shared with Dr. Carole Ganz,                   
              Program Manager of the International Centers Cooperative Program,              
              Division of International Programs.                                            
                   The Program Manager recommends Alfred University be awarded               
              $55,000 for the first year for a three year continuing award.
