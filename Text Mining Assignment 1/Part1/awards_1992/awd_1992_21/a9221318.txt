Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This proposal seeks funding to develop a unique 8192 x 8192 CCD                
              mosaic camera to be used to carry out a program of distant comet               
              recovery.  The proposed Camera will be the largest CCD mosaic in               
              existence, allowing very faint imaging over large areas for the                
              first time.  The goal of the comet recovery program is to detect               
              periodic comets prior to the onset of sublimation in order to study            
              the physical and chemical composition of cometary nuclei which                 
              includes both the characterization of the bare nucleus and                     
              modelling of the development of activity.  It will be possible to              
              recover comets as far out as 4-10 AU, with a limiting magnitude of             
              24, and a field of view of approximately 0.9 degree.  This program             
              will be conducted with the proposed instrument from Mauna Kea                  
              (using the 0.6m telescope) and from the Cerro Tololo Interamerican             
              Observatory (CTIO) using a smaller CCD system built at CTIO for                
              their Schmidt telescope.  Additionally, the camera will be used to             
              conduct a survey in order to characterize the poorly defined                   
              population of Earth-crossing Aten asteroids which can be potential             
              space hazards.  The proposed CCD instrument will also be available             
              for use on the UH 2.2m telescope and the Canada-France-Hawaii                  
              telescope.  Other UH planetary staff and students plan to use the              
              instrument for wide-field lunar observations, wide-field                       
              observations of comet dust and plasma tails, search for occulation             
              candidates for outer Solar System bodies, and for astrometric                  
              support for Hubble Space Telescope Observations, and additional                
              collaborations with outside planetary observers have been arranged             
              for searches for the Kuiper cometary belt.
