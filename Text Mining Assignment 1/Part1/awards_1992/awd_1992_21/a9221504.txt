Abstract    :
                   Biodiversity studies address questions about the origin and               
              maintenance of taxonomic, functional, and genetic diversity within             
              appropriately chosen groups of animals and plants.  This project               
              focuses on the evolutionary history of a diverse group of mammals,             
              the ground squirrels (genus Spermophilus, 42 species) and the                  
              prairie dogs (genus Cynomys, 4 species).  Because they are active              
              in the daytime, tend to live in groups , and are of considerable               
              economic importance, these animals have been the subject of                    
              numerous behavioral and life-history studies and have been central             
              to the development of kinship theory and optimal foraging theory               
              for mammals.  To place this knowledge in phylogenetic perspective,             
              the investigators will collaborate with Mexican and Russian                    
              colleagues in collecting materials of all known species, for                   
              molecular analyses of DNA.  A phylogeny or genealogical tree will              
              be constructed based upon mutational differences among the species.            
              %%%                                                                            
                   A phylogeny of this group of mammals will serve as a framework            
              for testing theories about the origin and maintenance of sociality             
              in mammals and of other behavioral and life-history traits.  It                
              will also facilitate measurement of genetic variation within                   
              particular lineages.  A phylogenetic framework will make possible              
              an evaluation of historical (heritable) factors and current                    
              ecological adaptations in molding behavior, life history, and                  
              social organization in mammals.
