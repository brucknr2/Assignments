Abstract    :
              9221293  Bertsekas    This award will support collaborative research  between
              Dimitri Bertsekas, Massachusetts Institute  of Technology, and Stefano
              Pallottino, University of  Pisa, Italy.  The collaborative research will focus 
              on optimization problems that have a network  structure, in particular,
              shortest path problems.    The research will seek to understand the performance
               of existing shortest path and other network  algorithms, with particular
              emphasis on a recently  proposed class called auction algorithms.    The
              primary benefit of the collaboration is the  joining of complementary skills
              and compatible  research views.  Professor Pallottino is one of the  world's
              foremost experts on shortest path  algorithms, and Professor Bertsekas is a
              principal  developer of the class of auction algorithms for  network
              optimization.  The research will focus on  three main aspects:  1) algorithm
              development; 2)  performance and complexity analysis, and 3)  experimental
              validation, in which each of the  collaborators takes primary responsibility
              for one  or more of these areas.    ***
