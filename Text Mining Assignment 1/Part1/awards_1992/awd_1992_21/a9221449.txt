Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This award will partially cover cost-of-living expenses                        
              for Dr. Richard Ladner of the Department of Computer Science and               
              Engineering at University of Washington while he is conducting                 
              research at Victoria University in Wellington, New Zealand with                
              Dr. Ewan Tempero. These two researchers plan to investigate the                
              problems associated with designing an end-to-end transport layer               
              protocol in the Open Systems Interconnect (OSI) model of a                     
              computer network in the light of recent theoretical work.  The                 
              new theoretical results raise the possibility of a new class of                
              efficient protocols for this problem. The protocols will be                    
              investigated by analytically and experimentally exploring which                
              design variations have the best chance of practical                            
              implementation. Those with most promise will be implemented under              
              Unix using the Internetwork Protocol in a controlled environment.              
                                                                                             
              This work brings together the expertise of Dr. Tempero in systems              
              research and Dr. Ladner in theoretical research. This cooperative              
              activity builds on Dr. Ladner's current NSF supported work in                  
              distributed and parallel computing (CCR-9108314). Ladner's                     
              travel expenses to New Zealand are being covered under a 1992-                 
              1993 Fulbright Travel Grant.
