Abstract    :
              9221276  Cottrell    Learning Semantic Representations for Information Retrieval
                 This is the first year funding of a three-year continuing award.  The
              objective of this project is to develop methods to  automatically represent
              text-based documents from a large  collection in a way which facilitates
              semantically precise  retrieval.  A critical problem in representing documents
              is that  words in the documents are not accurate descriptors of document 
              content.  This is in part due to the polysemy of natural language:  A single
              concept can be described in many different ways.  Most  current approaches fail
              to account for this, as they determine  semantic relevance using co-occurrence
              of words in documents.  The  approach is to index documents so that they are
              representationally  similar when they are semantically related, not just when
              they  coincidentally share terms.  Multidimensional Scaling (MDS) and  Neural
              Network theory are foundations of the work.  This approach  is demonstrated to
              be similar to the best current technique for  statistical semantic analysis of
              documents: Latent Semantic  Indexing (LSI).  The work suggests a generalization
              of LSI, a  linear and metric technique, to non-linear and non-metric 
              techniques.  This work is expected to provide a well-founded  theoretical
              framework for document indexing based on MDS, to  advance the use of neural
              network techniques in document indexing,  and to help in the quantitative
              evaluation of current document  retrieval methods.   ***
