Abstract    :
              For various superconducting single crystals and polycrystals                   
              (including those of high-Tc compounds), the magnetization will be              
              measured as a two-dimensional vector as the sample is rotated in a             
              fixed magnetic field.  These measurements seperate the diamagnetic             
              shielding component of the magnetization, leaving the penetrating              
              vortex-flux magnetization, whose frictional rotational behavior is             
              related to vortex pinning forces that govern the critical current              
              in these materials.  The viscous response of the penetrating                   
              vortex-flux magnetization will also be investigated.  For the                  
              single cystals, the measured anisotropy on the rotational magnetic             
              properties will provide a full characterization of the unusual                 
              modes of vortex-flux behavior (including cross-flux effects)                   
              previously found in these studies.                                             
              %%%                                                                            
              The magnetic polarization of various superconducting materials                 
              (including those of high critical temperatures) will be measured as            
              they are rotated in a magnetic field of different strengths.  The              
              frictional magnetic forces determined by these measurements are                
              directly related to the maximum electic current that the materials             
              can carry without losing their superconductivity.  This information            
              is needed to asses the technical potential for applications of                 
              these materials.
