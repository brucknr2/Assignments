Abstract    :
              Theoretical investigations will be done on relaxation of polymer               
              chains and liquid crystals in random environments, and on the time             
              evolution of morphologies in polymer blends and solutions with                 
              liquid crystals.  The full mathematical expressions will be derived            
              to describe the nonuniversal features of (a) dynamics of polymer               
              chains trapped in gels and controlled pore glasses; (b) phase                  
              separation kinetics leading to controlled pattern formation in                 
              polymer blends; and, (c) formation of polymer-dispersed-liquid-                
              crystal morphologies by phase separation kinetics and the                      
              relaxation of liquid crystalline domains in these morphologies.                
              The theoretical work complements many experimental investigations              
              which are being actively pursued in many laboratories worldwide.               
              The results of the proposed work are also relevant to the                      
              technologically important areas of separation techniques such as               
              chromatography, preparation and processing of molecular composites,            
              and switchable windows and light shutters for optical processing.

              This theoretical work in polymer science will use analytical and               
              computational techniques to address a number of problems of current            
              fundamental and applied interest.  Primary focus will be on the                
              behavior of polymer chains and liquid crystals in disordered                   
              environments and on the patterns formed when polymer mixtures are              
              combined with liquid crystals.
