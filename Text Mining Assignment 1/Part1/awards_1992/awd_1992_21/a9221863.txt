Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              It is proposed an experimental study on supersonic gas                         
              atomization of liquid metal for the synthesis of improved metal                
              powders by using a novel nozzle design.  Supersonic atomization                
              will be investigated mainly by flow visualization.  The                        
              capability of the proposed approach to yield a controlled                      
              particle size with a desired size distribution will be tested.                 
              A main scientific goal is the description of the secondary                     
              atomization mechanism (by stripping) at Weber numbers larger                   
              than 1000.  The experiments will make use of the Penn State                    
              laboratory facility equipped by DOD.                                           
                                                                                             
              The work is interdisciplinary, combining knowledge from                        
              atomization, powder metallurgy and flow visualization.  Prof.                  
              German, expert in powder metallurgy, will collaborate with the                 
              P. I.  This is an interdisciplinary  project having both                       
              scientific merit and practical relevance for the production of                 
              advanced metallic powders.
