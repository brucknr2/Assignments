Abstract    :
              93221592  Serrano    This two-year award supports U.S.-Spain cooperative 
              research between Sergio Serrano, University of  Kentucky, and Andres
              Sahuquillo, Polytechnic  University of Valencia, Spain.  They will  collaborate
              on the use of semi-analytical methods to  solve scale-dependent contaminant
              transport  equations in heterogeneous aquifers.      The solution of the
              differential equations for  contaminant transport in heterogeneous aquifers is 
              made difficult by the many varied boundaries and  interfaces encountered under
              natural conditions.   Executing numerical solutions methods on a fine 
              time-space grid slows the computations to an extent  that can make the method
              prohibitive. The use of  semi-analytical methods offers an alternative to 
              arrive at stable solutions that may result in more  accurate forecasting models
              and a better  understanding of contaminant migration in aquifers.   The project
              will take advantage of this approach,  more common to European hydrologists,
              and the  expertise of Dr. Sahuquillo and his development of  semi-analytical
              methods in groundwater hydrology.  This proposal contributes to greater
              intellectual  interaction between the different approaches of the  European and
              American communities that may lead to  significant contributions to this
              important problem.  * * *
