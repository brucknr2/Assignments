Abstract    :
              New laboratory methods developed by the Principal Investigator to              
              characterize the components of surface  charge will be applied to              
              benchmark soils from the tropical Americas in order to test their              
              sensitivity and ability to provide reproducible variable-charge                
              measurements  that are accurate for highly heterogeneous,                      
              structurally fragile mineral mixtures.  The project objectives are:            
              (1) to apply a cesium-adsorption method to measure structural                  
              surface charge, and (2) to apply new titration and ion adsorption              
              methods to measure variable-charge behavior in highly weathered                
              soils.  If these applications prove to be successful, they will                
              provide the basis for a systematic approach to chemical modeling               
              of tropical soils related to their role in continental-scale                   
              weathering and the global-scale cycling of chemical elements.
