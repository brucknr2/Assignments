Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This award provides support for Dr. Robert Hemminger of the                    
              Department of Mathematics at Vanderbilt University to make                     
              two trips to New Zealand over a two year period to collaborate                 
              with Prof. Derek Holton and Dr. Robert Aldred of the Department                
              of Mathematics and Statistics at the University of Otago in                    
              Dunedin. The research will be focused in the area of graph                     
              theory, specifically, problems dealing with contractibility and                
              connectivity in graphs.                                                        
                                                                                             
              This project draws upon the theoretical expertise of the                       
              investigators working on the topic of contractible edges.                      
              Over the past few years, this collaboration has resulted in seven              
              publications in the area of graph theory. The visit of                         
              Dr. Aldred to Vanderbilt University, in early 1993 to continue                 
              the collaboration, is supported through the New Zealand                        
              Government.
