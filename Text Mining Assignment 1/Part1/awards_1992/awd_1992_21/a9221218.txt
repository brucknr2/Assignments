Abstract    :
                   This project represents a collaborative effort between the                
              University of Arizona and the A.F. Ioffe Physical-Technical                    
              Institute in Russia.  They have had a long history of interest in              
              the use of cosmogenic isotopes from the natural archives to obtain             
              information concerning solar-terrestrial interaction and                       
              astrophysical phenomena prior to instrumental observation and                  
              measurement.  The focus is primarily on the cosmogenic isotopes 14C            
              and 10Be that are produced in the Earth's atmosphere by cosmic rays.           
              Cosmic rays convey information concerning astrophysical events such            
              as supernova explosions and are also modulated by the Earth's                  
              dipole magnetic field and the magnetic fields associated with the              
              solar wind that varies with other aspects of solar activity.  the              
              products are deposited in such natural archives as tree-rings,                 
              polar and montane ice, as well as lake and marine sediments.  Both             
              institutions have associated cosmogenic isotope laboratories and               
              tree-ring research laboratories as well as access to vast regions              
              containing the necessary natural archives.                                     
                   The cooperative research effort would enhance knowledge of the            
              frequency of supernova explosions in the Earth's vicinity and                  
              provide information on past changes in the geomagnetic field and               
              solar activity extending back several million years.  This work has            
              practical socioeconomic significance because, for example, solar               
              activity is a factor in climate change.
