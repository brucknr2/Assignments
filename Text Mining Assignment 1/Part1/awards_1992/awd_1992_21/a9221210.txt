Abstract    :
              9221210  Swanson    Fundamental aspects of point defects and self-compensation 
              phenomena in II-VI semiconductors will be studied using  perturbed angular
              correlation(PAC) measurements, and  relating the data to optical, electrical
              and magnetic  properties.  The atomic configurations, stabilities, defect 
              mobilities and ionization energies of various charge-  compensated donor-defect
              complexes will be determined.  By  studying these defects as a function of
              temperature and  annealing treatments it is sought 1)to understand in detail 
              their structure and behavior, 2)to determine the influence  of such complexes
              on bulk properties, and 3)to determine the  optimum conditions for minimizing
              the formation of  undesirable charge-compensated defects, and maximizing the 
              activation of donor impurities.  Both bulk and thin film  materials will be
              studied.  %%%  By correlating microscopic PAC observations with bulk 
              electrical and optical properties, it is anticipated that  the specific
              information gained on the nature and  significance of defects and defect
              interactions in wide- and  narrow-gap II-VI semiconductors will provide broad
              insight  into the behavior of defects systems in general.  This  deeper
              understanding will enable scientists and  technologists greater facility in the
              design and synthesis  of devices using these materials, such as infrared
              sensors,  lightemitting diodes, and semiconductor lasers, which, in  turn, may
              yield improvements in integrated circuits used in  computing, information
              processing, and telecommunications.  ***
