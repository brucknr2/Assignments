Abstract    :
              9221841  Wolfgang Sachtler    This is a systematic study of metal-proton adducts
              in zeolites,  including the role of these adducts in modifying the catalytic 
              characteristics of metal and in anchoring metal clusters to the  zeolite.  One
              issue addressed is whether the enhanced catalytic  activity of transition
              metals in proton-containing zeolites is due  to the electron deficiency of the
              metal particles or to the  chemical participation of adduct protons in the
              catalytic reaction.   The emphasis in this effort is on rhodium clusters
              although  additional work on palladium and platinum is also included.  The 
              rates of hydrocarbon conversion reactions on metals and metal-  proton adducts
              are compared with the electron deficiency of the  metals as determined by
              photoelectron spectroscopy.  Other  characterization techniques used include
              X-ray absorption methods  (using synchrotron radiation), electron microscopy,
              infrared  spectroscopy, nuclear magnetic resonance, temperature-programmed 
              mass spectrometric methods, and isotopic exchange.  The effects of  alcohols
              and amines on metal sintering in zeolites is also study.   Zeolites studied
              include Y, L, and ZSM-5.    The catalyst systems under study here are important
              in petroleum  refining and in the production of monomers for the fiber and 
              plastics industries.  The effects uncovered here could dramatically  influence
              the performance or lifetimes of these systems.
