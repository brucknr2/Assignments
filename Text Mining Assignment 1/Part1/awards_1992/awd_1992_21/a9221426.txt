Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                                                                                            
              This research is proposed under the Small Grants for Exploratory               
              Research program and focusses on the environmental and cultural                
              determinants of human fertility.  It is becoming increasingly                  
              apparent that many variables such as subsistence behavior greatly              
              affect fertility and demography and that cross-cultural studies are            
              of major significance in teasing apart the factors involved.  The              
              primary objective is to assess the feasibility of a full scale                 
              project concerning the reproductive ecology of three native groups             
              in South India.  The three groups involved would allow the                     
              comparison of groups living in the same physical environment but               
              practicing different subsistence patterns as well as the responses             
              to culture change. The investigator needs to assess the verbal and             
              written reports as to the subsistence adaptations in these                     
              populations and to verify that these three groups will allow the               
              appropriate comparisons.
