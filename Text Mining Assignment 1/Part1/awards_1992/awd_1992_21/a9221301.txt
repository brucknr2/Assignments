Abstract    :
                9221301  Silberschatz    Transaction Management in a Heterogeneous Database
              Environment    This is the first year of a three-year continuing award.  A 
              multidatabase system (MDBS) consists of a number of sites which run  distinct
              commercial database management systems (DBMSs). The goal  of an MDBS is to
              integrate the DBMSs, allowing applications to  access data from, without
              requiring modifications to, the  individual DBMSs. The autonomous user
              organizations in a  multidatabase system generally have invested substantial
              capital in  the DBMS and may, rightly, be unwilling to modify or lose control 
              over their DBMSs. Therefore, it is imperative to develop  multidatabase
              transaction processing methods that allow a high  degree of local autonomy, but
              support users' data in a consistent  and reliable manner. This research
              investigates how to manage and  guarantee consistency of data residing in
              heterogeneous DBMSs,  while adhering to the autonomy requirements of the
              participant  DBMSs. The MDBS transaction management schemes developed in this 
              research have the following characteristics: (1) adapt to MDBS  environments,
              existing techniques for ensuring database consistency  based on preserving
              transaction atomicity and serializability; (2)  utilize alternate correctness
              criteria that relax the  serializability and atomicity requirements.  Pilot
              systems  developed for both the serializability and the relaxed 
              serializability models are used to conduct performance evaluation  to ascertain
              that the developed schemes permit a high degree of  concurrency.  The results
              of the research will provide the basic  transaction management mechanisms
              necessary for the development of  a complete multidatabase management system.
