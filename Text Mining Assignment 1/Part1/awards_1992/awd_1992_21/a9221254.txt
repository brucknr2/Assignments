Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This dissertation research focusses on an important evolutionary               
              problem - how closely related populations of recently diversified              
              species begin to diverge in their niche utilization patterns.  The             
              primary question is, when such groups live in the same area, do                
              competitive forces drive them to begin to utilize different                    
              resources, or are they able to continue to subsist on the same                 
              sorts of regimens as other populations of their species, living                
              separately.  Alternatively, are such groups driven to live in the              
              same area because of competition of each with other members of                 
              their species living in other areas.                                           
                   The principal investigator is very experienced and well                   
              regarded in the field, and has the necessary contacts in northeast             
              Zaire to carry out the work over the course of a year.  Besides the            
              evolutionary questions, this is the first long term study of                   
              primates in such a species rich area of Africa, and should be                  
              relevant to conservation interests.
