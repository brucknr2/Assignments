Abstract    :
              This proposal seeks to capitalize on the recent developments in                
              RNA biochemistry to prepare purified RNA from a diverse range of               
              systems in quantities sufficient for crystallographic studies.                 
              It focuses on three RNAs that span a broad range of sizes and                  
              structural motifs:  dodecamer with non-canonical UU base pairs, a              
              30 nucleotide autolytic RNA, and a 160 nucleotide domain of the                
              Tetrahymena intron.  These RNAs will be examined with X-ray                    
              crystallography and several biochemical methods.  Thermal                      
              denaturation, kinetic, and chemical protection studies will be                 
              used to refine understanding of the crystallographic structure.                
              By integrating structural and biochemical results, Dr. Kundrot                 
              expects to obtain a better understanding of these RNA structures               
              and how they function.                                                         
              %%%                                                                            
              It has become increasingly apparent in the last decade that RNAs               
              play many roles in a cell that are important in human health and               
              biotechnology.  The structures RNAs adopt are of manifest                      
              importance because they play central roles in the regulation of                
              gene expression ranging from protein recognition sites to self-                
              splicing active sites.  The three-dimensional structure of RNA                 
              molecules must be determined if we are to understand how RNA can               
              adopt stable folds and perform functions such as catalysis.  Dr.               
              Kundrot proposes to determine the structure of three RNA                       
              molecules:  a self-cleaving RNA, an RNA with unusual base pairs,               
              and a RNA folding domain that is more than twice as large as the               
              largest RNA structure known today.  These structures will provide              
              with new insights into how RNA functions in cells and these                    
              insights will help in the development of drugs to improve human                
              health and will open up new areas in biotechnology.
