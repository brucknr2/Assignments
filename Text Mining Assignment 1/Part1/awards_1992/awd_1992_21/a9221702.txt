Abstract    :
              The purpose of this US-China collaborative research project is to              
              develop techniques to synthesize and then process poly(ethylene                
              terephthalate) (PET) fibers so that they have ultra high strength              
              as well as a high melting temperature.  The material will be made              
              in two steps: first, solid state polymerization will be used to                
              produce the ultra-high molecular weight linear polymer, followed               
              by solution/gel spinning to orient the long chain molecules.  The              
              international collaboration will benefit both principal                        
              investigators (PI) who have different and complementary expertise              
              and equipment: the American PI Hsieh has the instrumentation for               
              fiber analysis and polymer characterization, while the Chinese PI              
              has the expertise and facility for fiber spinning.
