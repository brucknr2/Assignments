                   To promote state-wide collaboration in the educational and                
              research programs of the University of Arizona's Health Sciences               
              Center (AHSC) through expanding network connectivity of Arizona's

              Center, Arizona State University, Tucson Medical Center, Veterans

                   1. providing individual connections to the Internet via leased            
              telephone lines for major non-University teaching hospitals                    
              affiliated with the AHSC, and                                                  
                   2. providng dial up access to the Internet for an initial                 
              demonstration group of rural teaching sites affiliated with the                
              AHSC.                                                                          
                   3. Each of the major non-University teaching hospitals                    
              affiliated with the AHSC has agreed to security and maintain a                 
              leased telephone line dedicated to the network connectivity                    
              described in this proposal.  Grant funds would defray the hardware             
              costs for initiating this connection.                                          
                   4. A modem bank will be established at the AHSC, through which            
              dial-up access to the Internet will be available at no cost to                 
              rural practioners and teaching sites.                                          
                   5. The co-investigators will promote and support the use of               
              this new statewide connectivity, and foster its continued                      
              expansion.
