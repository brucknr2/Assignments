Abstract    :
              Since 1985 the Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County                    
              (LACM) echinoderm holdings increased 1900%, from 2000% to over                 
              40000 lots, chiefly through the incorporation of the Allan                     
              Hancock Foundation Collection and other "orphaned" material.                   
              LACM now houses the largest echinoderm collection in the western               
              United States and the third largest in the country; its coverage               
              is cosmopolitan, with the unexcelled representation of the                     
              eastern Pacific and Caribbean faunas.  A previous NSF grant, now               
              nearing completion, supported the transfer of the collection to                
              the permanent, environmentally controlled collection space                     
              furnished by the museum, and a curatorial upgrade, of part of the              
              collection.  Additional efforts are necessary to complete the                  
              upgrade and reorganize the collection.  This project will (1)                  
              purchase and install museum cases and shelves, and move specimens              
              from inadequate storage equipment to new units, and (2) complete               
              and urgently needed transfer of specimens to satisfactory                      
              containers and preservatives.  These improvements will ensure the              
              collections availability for scientific research.

              Collections such as those of the LACM are invaluable resources                 
              not only for the performance of primary research but also for                  
              other diverse activities.  Exhibit and educational activities                  
              based upon the collections underwrite the scientific literacy of               
              the general population.  As well the collections are important to              
              the documentation and assessment of the impacts of development                 
              projects.//
