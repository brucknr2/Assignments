Abstract    :
              This award adds six higher education institutions to the CERFnet               
              midlevel network.  Four of the institutions are primarily                      
              undergraduate colleges, one a community college, and one a                     
              university research center.  Faculty and students at the                       
              institutions will benefit from access to the resources of the                  
              Internet, including libraries and supercomputers.  In addition,                
              they will be able to communicate and collaborate with colleagues at            
              other campuses in pursuit of research and educational projects.
