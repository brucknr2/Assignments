Abstract    :
                   The Oregon Institute of Technology is establishing a                      
              connection to NSFNET via a 56,000 bits per second  line through the            
              NorthWestNet mid-level network.  The connection enables the                    
              school's faculty and students to communicate and collaborate with              
              the international scientific and educational community, and to                 
              access network resources such as libraries, databases and                      
              supercomputers.  This award funds  part of the costs for two years.
