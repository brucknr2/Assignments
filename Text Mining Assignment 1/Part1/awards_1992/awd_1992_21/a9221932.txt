Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This Americas Program award will fund a cooperative                            
              research project, involving sol-gel processing and                             
              characterization of supported metal catalysts,                                 
              between Dr. Richard D. Gonzalez of Tulane University                           
              and Professors Ricardo Gomez Romero and Tessy Lopez                            
              Goerne of the Autonomous Metropolitan University of                            
              Mexico at Iztapalapa.  The focus of this proposed                              
              study will be on sol-gel processing of silica and                              
              alumina.  A new series of high surface area                                    
              catalysts in which the metal is in a highly                                    
              dispersed state will be prepared.  Sol-gel                                     
              processing will lead to the formation of more                                  
              homogenous-supported metal catalysts with a much                               
              more uniform distribution of particle sizes.  The                              
              reforming catalysts prepared by sol-gel processing                             
              have the potential to compete favorably with                                   
              industrial catalysts in use.                                                   
                                                                                             
              This cooperative research project will share                                   
              facilities available at Tulane University and                                  
              Mexico.  The synthetic procedures and catalyst                                 
              characterization studies will be performed at Tulane                           
              while catalytic studies will be performed in Mexico.
