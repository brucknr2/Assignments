Abstract    :
              In this project, the PI's will study ocean thermohaline                        
              circulation and its variability in ocean models, and relate this               
              to climate variability.  Work already underway on two Atlantic                 
              models will be continued.  Subsequently, the domain will be                    
              extended to include the Pacific basin, joined to the Atlantic by               
              the Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC).
