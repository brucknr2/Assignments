Abstract    :
                Currently, there is no parallel algorithm that can solve                     
              optimal control problems efficiently on computers with a large                 
              number of processors.  This research will develop two parallel                 
              algorithms to solve large scale optimal control problems that are              
              expected to be efficient with a large number of processors.  The               
              first algorithm, called the Hybrid algorithm, is a combination of              
              the Differential Dynamic Programming (DDP) and a stagewise                     
              Newton's method, both of which are serial.  The Hybrid parallel                
              algorithm is designed primarily for unconstrained optimal control              
              problems.  The second algorithm, called an SQP-type algorithm, is              
              derived by utilizing special features of the optimal control                   
              problem along with a Sequential Quadratic Programming (SQP)                    
              approach.  The SQP-type algorithm is suitable for both the                     
              unconstrained and constrained optimal control problem.  In both                
              algorithms, each processor is assigned to solve an optimization                
              problem over a group of time periods.  Codes will be developed                 
              for machines with medium-grain parallel capabilities e.g., the                 
              Intel iPSC/860 and Kendall Square computers.  A typical                        
              engineering application involving a nonlinear flexible structural              
              problem with 10,000 time periods will be used to evaluate the                  
              proposed algorithms.
