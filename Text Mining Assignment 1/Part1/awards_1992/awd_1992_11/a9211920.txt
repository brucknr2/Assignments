Abstract    :
              Courts depend on litigants -- individuals, government agencies,                
              businesses and increasingly, interest groups -- to bring policy                
              issues to their attention.  To understand the agendas of courts,               
              it is crucial to determine how litigants decide to bring claims to             
              court.  This dissertation grant provides support to Cary Coglianese            
              to examine how one important set of litigants, interest groups,                
              decides which claims to file in court.                                         
                                                                                             
              While scholars have developed models explaining how individuals                
              select claims to bring to court, the process of dispute selection              
              in organizations is much less understood.  Mr. Coglianese's                    
              dissertation research fills in this gap in sociolegal understanding            
              by developing and testing a model of organizational dispute                    
              selection.  Investigating interest groups active in environmental              
              policy, the study draws on interviews with the staff and legal                 
              counsel of 25 interest groups, as well as on an analysis of court              
              briefs and other primary sources.  In addition to advancing                    
              understanding of organizational dispute selection, the study's                 
              focus on dispute selection facilitates examination of how legal                
              rules influence the decision-making of interest groups.                        
              Specifically, variations in environmental statutes on such matters             
              as standing, proof, and attorney's fees are examined to see how                
              they influence interest groups' decisions about which cases to                 
              bring to court.  Therefore, the project also contributes to basic              
              understanding about the sociolegal dynamics influencing interest               
              group behavior.
