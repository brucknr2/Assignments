Abstract    :
                   New variables recently introduced by Abhay Ashtekar will                  
              be used to calculate numerically solutions to Einstein's                       
              equations corresponding to plane gravitational waves                           
              propagating on spacetimes of finite spatial extent.  The                       
              results of the computations will be compared with known exact                  
              analytical solutions, approximate analytical solutions, and                    
              numerical solutions obtained by other authors using                            
              conventional variables.  It is expected that this new computer                 
              code will result in more rapid computation with greater                        
              accuracy.  Generalizations of the technique, including the                     
              incorporation of matter sources, the relaxation of symmetry                    
              requirements, and changes of spatial topologies, will lead to                  
              potent new tools for studying problems of current                              
              astrophysical interest.  In particular, a new approach will be                 
              available to study the relation between non-linear                             
              gravitational wave interaction and the formation of galaxies,                  
              and to generate numerically the radiative spacetimes of two                    
              interacting black holes.
