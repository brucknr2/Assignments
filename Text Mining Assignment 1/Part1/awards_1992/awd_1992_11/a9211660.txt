Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Male reproductive function is under the control of a region of the             
              brain called the medial preoptic area. Within that area several                
              neurotransmitters and their interactions modulate that function.               
              In this award, Dr. Elaine Hull will study the effects of direct                
              injections of neurotransmitter substances into the medial preoptic             
              area as well as the endogenous levels of these substances in the               
              same region. The technique used to collect fluid bathing the brain             
              tissue is microdialysis and the technique used to measure the                  
              levels of the neurotransmitters is high performance liquid                     
              chromatography. Both of these techniques are very sensitive to the             
              small amounts of neurotransmitters that are normally present within            
              brain tissue. Behavioral observations will be made in order to                 
              determine which neurotransmitters are released during reproductive             
              behavior. The neurotransmitters studied will be serotonin,                     
              dopamine, and gamma-aminobutyric acid. This will provide                       
              information about the biochemical messages that control                        
              reproductive function. The knowledge gained in these studies will              
              contribute to understanding how the brain controls complex                     
              functions, such as reproduction.
