Abstract    :
              The research to be performed on this RIA award will investigate                
              the role of the interface and interphase region on the toughening              
              of highly crosslinked epoxy polymers.  Two distinct approaches                 
              will be examined through the study of rubber-modified epoxies and              
              thermoplastic-modified epoxies.  The results of these studies                  
              will enable the development of highly crosslinked epoxies with                 
              improved quality and reliability.
