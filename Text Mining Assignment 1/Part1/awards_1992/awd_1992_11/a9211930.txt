Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The main objective of this research is to understand the                       
              relationships between leaping behaviors and the design of the limb             
              skeleton in living and fossil primates.  Leaping behaviors have                
              been hypothesized to be an important component in the evolution of             
              modern primates.  This research will clarify form-function                     
              relationships in living prosimians by examination of mechanically              
              important aspects of leaping behaviors and limb longbones. Analysis            
              of captive galagine and lemurid leaping will be based on                       
              qualitative kinematic descriptions of videotaped locomotor                     
              sequences.  Mechanically sensitive aspects of limb longbones,                  
              including cortical bone cross-sectional area and geometry, will be             
              determined from measurements made on radiographs of museum                     
              specimens.  Form-function relations demonstrated in living species             
              will allow inferences of the locomotor adaptations of the earliest             
              modern primates to be made.
