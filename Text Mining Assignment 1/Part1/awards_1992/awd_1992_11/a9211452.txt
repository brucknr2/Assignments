Abstract    :
              The decision-making of the United States Supreme Court is of                   
              substantial interest to social scientists, journalists, and                    
              laypersons alike.  Beginning in 1983, the Law and Social Science               
              Program provided support for the construction of a multi-user data             
              base that codifies a wide range of dimensions relevant to Supreme              
              Court decision-making, and makes these data available to social                
              scientists and other parties through the Interuniversity Consortium            
              for Political and Social Research in Ann Arbor, Michigan.  This                
              grant will extend the data base and therefore, enhance scholarship             
              on the Supreme Court.                                                          
                                                                                             
              Specifically, this collaborative project with Spaeth, the principal            
              investigator of the original project, and Jan Palmer will extend               
              the NSF-funded U.S. Supreme Court Judicial Data Base (now covering             
              the Warren, Burger and Rehnquist years) to encompass comparable                
              data on the official votes of the Vinson Court (1946-1953).  A                 
              second extension integrates data related to the official votes with            
              a data base created by Palmer that contains the justices'                      
              conference voting and opinion assignments.  This data base, which              
              encompasses the Vinson Court, will be extended to include the                  
              Warren Court.  The resulting project will span 23 terms of the                 
              Supreme Court (1946-1968) and the behavior of the 20 justices who              
              then served.  As with the original data base, these extensions will            
              be archived at the Inter-University Consortium, and will be                    
              available as an SPSS export file.  The richness of the resulting               
              data will tremendously enhance the formulation of theory and                   
              testing of hypotheses with respect to the Supreme Court.
