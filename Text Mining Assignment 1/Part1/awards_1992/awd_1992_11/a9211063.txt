Abstract    :
              A research project on the processing and characterization of                   
              cement-based composites containing high volume fraction of                     
              fibers is to be performed.  The study concentrates on the                      
              manufacturing techniques and the constitutive laws based                       
              on the relationship among the fiber, matrix, interface,                        
              and the processing technique employed.  The mechanical                         
              properties of these composites as a function of fiber                          
              lengths, interfacial properties, matrix properties, and                        
              the processing technique will be measured.  Responses such                     
              as complete stress-strain curves, experimental R-curve,                        
              and post-peak stress-crack width relationship will be                          
              measured using digitally controlled closed loop tests.  The                    
              in quantitative optical microscopy using image analysis                        
              techniques will be developed to measure stress induced                         
              microcracking. An R-Curve approach will be developed for                       
              the pull-out response of fibers.  This approach will be                        
              implemented in a composite fracture model to predict the                       
              optimum material properties.
