Abstract    :
              This is a one year cooperative research project proposed by                    
              Dr. Neil Lundberg, Florida State University, and Professor M. P.               
              Chen, Taiwan University, supported by the AIT (U.S.) - CCNAA                   
              (Taiwan) Cooperative Science Program.  This proposal plans to                  
              core the active collision zone close to Taiwan. The U.S.-Taiwan                
              Program provides funds for U.S. scientists' travels and                        
              incidental laboratory expenses to enable Dr. Lundberg and two                  
              students to participate in a coring program in the collision zone              
              south of Taiwan, while the Taiwan National Science Council                     
              provides the ship and field support.  Dr. Lundberg is well known               
              in this field of science.  The subject is of significant                       
              importance to provide information useful to understanding the                  
              collision processes occurring in this area.
