Abstract    :
              The Theoretical and Computational Chemistry Program of the                     
              Chemistry Division is supporting research by Lionel Raff at                    
              Oklahoma State University on the theoretical investigation of                  
              chemical processes under matrix isolation conditions.  The                     
              studies include reaction dynamics, energy transfer, mobility,                  
              and diffusion of fluorine, oxygen, hydrogen, deuterium, and                    
              tritium atoms in matrices of argon, krypton, and xenon.                        
              Further, addition reactions of fluorine and chlorine to                        
              ethylene and of HBr to acetylene and subsequent elimination                    
              reactions are being investigated.                                              
              %%%                                                                            
              Many chemical reactions and spectroscopic properties can be                    
              studied most effectively by freezing the species of interest in                
              a matrix consisting of an inert gas.  This research involves a                 
              theoretical investigation of the dynamics of such reactions as                 
              well as molecular mobility and energy transfer under such                      
              conditions.
