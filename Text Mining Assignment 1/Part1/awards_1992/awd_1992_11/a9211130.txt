Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              We are interested in developing efficient parallel algorithms for              
              computational materials science.  In particular, we intend to                  
              continue ongoing research on semiconductor alloys in the                       
              framework of Monte Carlo simulations of a generalized lattice gas              
              model including elastic degrees of freedom.  This materials                    
              research project, which is interesting both from the point of                  
              view of fundamental research, as well as with respect to                       
              potential technological applications, shall be extended in order               
              to study surface reconstruction, the behavior of expitaxial                    
              films, and electronic structure.  The simulation program, which                
              presently is fully vectorized, shall be modified in order to make              
              the algorithm suitable for parallel processing using the                       
              "parallel virtual machine" software.
