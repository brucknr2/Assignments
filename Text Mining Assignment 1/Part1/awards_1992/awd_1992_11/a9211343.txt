Abstract    :
                   The investigation and application of techniques for                       
              obtaining macroscopic approximations for communication networks                
              is studied. These approximations are deterministic,  described by              
              ordinary differential equations, and stochastic (diffusion),                   
              described by  stochastic differential equations.  The former                   
              yield approximations for the time dependent behavior, while the                
              latter quantify the statistical deviations. The techniques                     
              consist of a combination of weak convergence and martingale                    
              methods. The proposed methods allow for the investigation of                   
              networks with service times having not only  exponential but also              
              general service time distributions. The transmission rates can                 
              be taken to depend on the buffer occupancies, which is important               
              in congestion control applications. The importance of those                    
              approximations becomes clear given the  non-existence of flexible              
              analytical tools that can give estimates of queue lengths and                  
              other performance measures for such (non-product-form) networks.               
              The approximate models, arising via certain limiting procedures,               
              will be used to further study stability  issues, settling times                
              and rates of convergence to the steady state. The methods and                  
              estimates will be established mathematically and also validated                
              numerically and by  simulations.
