Abstract    :
              In the first step of visual analysis, early vision, simple image               
              properties such as brightness, color, texture, stereoscopic                    
              disparity, motion patterns are analyzed and boundaries, lines, and             
              other salient visual structures of the image are measured and                  
              extracted.  A number of theoretical and empirical arguments point              
              to the possibility that all early vision tasks may be accomplished             
              by algorithms sharing a common computational structure:                        
              convolution with kernels of different orientations, scales, and                
              shapes followed by simple quasi-local nonlinear operations.  Such              
              kernals may be generated as deformations (rotations, scalings                  
              stretchings) of a template kernel which is synthesized from task               
              specifications.  In the last two years a method based on singular              
              value decomposition (SVD) has been proposed to make such                       
              continuous-parameter filtering feasible- it has been demonstrated              
              for rotations and scaling in 2 dimensions.  This research                      
              endeavours to(1) demonstrate the method in new situations including            
              3D rotations and scalings stretchings and changes of curvature, (2)            
              apply the method to generating filters for various early vision                
              tasks including texture and motion analysis, (3) explore new early             
              vision algorithms made possible by continuous-parameter filtering,             
              (4) understand the connections between filter-design techniques and            
              the SVD method. //
