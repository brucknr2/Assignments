Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This project studies the incorporation of a diverse rural                      
              population into the banana industry of Belize. An anthropologist               
              from the University of South Alabama will conduct an ethnographic              
              study of ethnic diversity in the recruitment and deployment of                 
              workers from Black and Indian ethnic origins.  The project will                
              examine the differences between ethnicity and class as causes of               
              labor force participation by interviewing workers, growers, and                
              processors in depth, on their values and opinions about the                    
              appropriate work for members of different ethnic groups.                       
                                                                                             
              This research is important because ethnic hostilities are a                    
              common cause of labor force troubles.  This case study of a local              
              industry in a multi-ethnic area will provide valuable information              
              on the nature of ethnic hostility, and how it relates to socio-                
              economic class differences.  This information will be valuable to              
              those concerned with minimizing ethnic antagonisms in labor                    
              forces in similar situations.
