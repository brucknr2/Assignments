Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Many divergent forms of locomotor styles exist among the tetrapod              
              (four-footed) groups of vertebrates. The design of an avian wing               
              represents a balance between selective pressures driving the                   
              energetic efficiency of this rapidly oscillating forelimb and those            
              retaining maneuverability for flight. This highly sophisticated                
              structure provides aerodynamic lift, propulsion, and some degree               
              of directional control during aerial locomotion. In this award, Dr.            
              Kenneth Dial will study neuromuscular coordination by determining              
              the activity patterns of selected avain flight muscles during                  
              maneuverable free-flight and during prolonged steady-state (wind               
              tunnel) flight. In addition, recordings will be made of the                    
              magnitude and time course of forces generated by the primary flight            
              muscles during steady-state and maneuverable flight. From these                
              measurements, the bilateral symmetry of forces developed by the                
              primary flight muscles can be determined, and the mechanical power             
              output during various modes of locomotion can be calculated. These             
              studies will contribute basic knowledge to understanding the                   
              control of movement.
