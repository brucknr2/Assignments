Abstract    :
              Professor Batterman aims to provide an in-depth philosophical                  
              discussion of the status of semiclassical mechanics.  This is an               
              area of research that is located somewhere between classical and               
              quantum mechanics, and which can most profitably be viewed as a                
              modern formulation of the old (pre-1925) quantum theory.  A large              
              part of the concern with this question comes from the fact that                
              many researchers in semiclassical mechanics appear to take the                 
              results as explanatory, and even to provide genuine understanding              
              of various quantum phenomena in terms almost entirely classical.               
              The nature of this understanding is being investigated by                      
              considering in detail some examples of how apparent failures of the            
              old quantum theory have, subsequently, succumbed to semiclassical              
              treatment.  It is Professor Batterman's major contention that for              
              semiclassical mechanics to provide genuine explanations and                    
              understanding, it must be considered a theory in its own right.  It            
              is not simply an approximation to the quantum theory; that is, not             
              merely a procedure for computing approximations to quantal                     
              solutions.  It is the aim of this project to consider the                      
              implications of this claim.
