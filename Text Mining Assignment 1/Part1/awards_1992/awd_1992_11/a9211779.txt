Abstract    :
              This study will attempt to identify the current level of U.S.                  
              civil engineering related R&D funding, the funding organizations,              
              the research performers, and the areas of research emphasis for                
              the following sectors:                                                         
                                                                                             
                   - Federal Government                                                      
                   - State Government                                                        
                   - Private Industry (design firms, contractors,                            
                                                                                             
                      manufacturers, etc.)                                                   
                   - Non-Profits                                                             
                   - Colleges & Universities                                                 
                                                                                             
              The survey results should be of direct interest to all Federal                 
              agencies, and the private sector by helping to define levels of                
              R&D in the design and construction industry, as well as the                    
              overall R&D focus.  The results should provide a useful baseline               
              frame of reference for future R&D investments, strategies, and in              
              the identification of gaps in research funding.  For this survey               
              to be of maximum use in establishing a design and construction                 
              industry R&D baseline, it should also facilitate comparison with               
              civil engineering R&D figures published in other countries.
