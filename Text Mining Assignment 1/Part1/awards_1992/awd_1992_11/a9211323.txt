Abstract    :
              The objective of this research is to build a high-level synthesis              
              system which maps behavioral descriptions into register-transfer               
              level designs with guaranteed performance.  The approach is to                 
              examine subtasks of the high-level synthesis problem using                     
              theoretical tools necessary to understand the synthesis problem.               
              Synthesis subtasks in the areas of scheduling and datapath                     
              allocation are being examined.  Scheduling problems being                      
              investigated include: finding good heuristics to bound the search              
              space so that good quality schedules for large size designs can be             
              found in a timely way; use an integer programming formulation to               
              solve the module selection problem; and develop a powerful, integer            
              programming based, algorithm to optimally group functions into                 
              hardware modules.  Register allocation problems include: devising              
              a register allocation algorithm which will minimize both the number            
              of registers and register transfers in the presence of loops and               
              conditionals while accounting for interconnect cost; formulate the             
              module allocation problem along the same lines as the register                 
              allocation; and investigate a good ordering of the allocation                  
              subtasks so that interconnects play a major role in the design                 
              process.
