Abstract    :
                This award supports a program of continued studies using the                 
              vacuum ultraviolet high-resolution spectrometer facility (HRSF) at             
              the SURF II storage ring of the National Institute for Standards               
              and Technology (NIST).  After more than two years of intensive work            
              under the previous grant, by the University of the District of                 
              Columbia's faculty and students and NIST personnel, the                        
              spectrometer facility is ready for its intended purpose of                     
              measuring useful EUV cross-sections of interest in Aeronomy:                   
              intensity is up by a factor of 120 over two years ago and the                  
              resolution has improved from 0.014 A to , 0.009 A.  Experiments                
              will be performed to measure absolute absorption in N2.  The high              
              resolution measurements near 83.4 nm will provide new information              
              needed to accurately model the interaction of solar EUV radiation              
              with the terrestrial upper atmosphere.
