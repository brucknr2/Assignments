Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This award supports the dissertation research of an anthropology               
              student from Northwestern University.  The project will study                  
              return migration from Lusaka, Zambia's capital city, to a rural                
              province.  The student will examine the gender division of labor               
              within the migrant economy as well as the influence of government              
                                                                                             
              policies on migrant strategies.                                                
                                                                                             
              This research is important as a counter-example to the simplistic              
                                                                                             
              model of rural-to-urban migration that most commentators on this               
              subject adopt.  In reality migration has always contained                      
              counter-flows, and this case study will provide valuable                       
              information on migrant strategies and values that will be useful               
              to policy makers in dealing with problems of migration.
