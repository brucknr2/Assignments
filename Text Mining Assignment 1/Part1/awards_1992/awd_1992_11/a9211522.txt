Abstract    :
              This award supports seven U.S. anthropologists to participate in a             
              regional European workshop on the ethnography of modern Iceland.               
              The small meeting is jointly organized by Dr. E. Paul Durrenberger             
              of the University of Iowa and Dr. Gisli Palsson of the Faculty of              
              Social Science of the University of Iceland.   It will be held at              
              the University of Iowa in late May, 1993.  The objective of the                
              workshop is to analyze ethnographic aspects of major questions                 
              facing modern Iceland, especially in the context of ongoing                    
              developments in Europe and America.  Among these issues are                    
              negotiations about regulating fishing and whaling under the European           
              Economic Community (EEC), how the economic and political system of             
              Iceland affects its relations with the emerging EEC, the role of               
              American policy and Icelanders' reaction to it.  In addition, the              
              meeting participants will analyze the colonial roots of the modern             
              period and the political uses of the past in the construction of               
              national identity.                                                             
                                                                                             
              This meeting will encourage expansion of the focus of research on              
              the culture and people of Iceland away from the romantic-                      
              nationalistic school of folk studies and toward examination of its             
              place in the contemporary world.  The discussions are also likely to           
              contribute to the broader question of what constitutes an adequate             
              ethnographic description of a highly literate and modern state                 
              society.
