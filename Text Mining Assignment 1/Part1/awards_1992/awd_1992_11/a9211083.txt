Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The proposed research includes several interconnected areas of                 
              activity.  First among them is the continuing developments of a                
              general stabilized finite element method for incompressible fluid              
              flows in the presence of moving boundaries, with particular                    
              emphasis on free surface and two-phase flows.  The method is                   
              based on a stabilized space-time formulation, and is capable of                
              handling large deformations of the domain.  The velocity-                      
              pressure-stress formulation will be developed in parallel.  It is              
              a novel stabilized formulation for incompressible flows which is               
              applicable to viscoelastic fluids.  This research area will be                 
              merged into the space-time method development, to allow for                    
              numerical treatment of viscoelastic fluids in the presence of                  
              moving boundaries.  Proposed finite element formulations result                
              in large linear systems of equations.  These systems will be                   
              solved implicitly using a GMRES iterative method.  To improve the              
              rate of convergence, efficient preconditioning techniques will be              
              designed and test.  Among others, techniques combining the                     
              Clustered Element-By-Element and Multigrid approaches will be                  
              examined.  All implementation work will concentrate on massively               
              parallel architectures.
