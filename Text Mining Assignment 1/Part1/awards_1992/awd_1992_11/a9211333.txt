Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This proposal is concerned with undertaking Monte Carlo                        
              simulations aided by effective medium approximately to                         
              understand molecular diffusion on surfaces and in microporous                  
              solids.  In particular the effects of co-adsorbed species,                     
              surface defects and surface steps on chain molecular diffusion                 
              will be examined.  The effective medium approximations are a                   
              powerful method for making such problems tractable.
