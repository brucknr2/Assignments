Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The objective of this research is to use the most advanced                     
              computing environments and the most efficient computational                    
              techniques available to study the long term dynamics of normal                 
              and abnormal electrical activity in heart tissue.  A patch of                  
              heart tissue is modeled as a two- or three-dimensional grid of                 
              cells the electrochemical activity in each cell being modeled by               
              systems of nonlinear ordinary differential equations (ODE) and                 
              with resistive coupling between each pair of cells.                            
                                                                                             
              We propose to directly simulate a nonlinear partial differential               
              equation (PDE) formulation of the system  to examine the long                  
              term dynamical behaviors such as frequency entrainment in                      
              pacemaker sinus cells, the development and propagation of                      
              arrhythmias in the normally quiescent atrial cell tissue and the               
              interaction of the normal pacemaking activity and abnormal atrial              
              ectopic beats in combined sinus node-atrial tissue.                            
                                                                                             
              The solution of the system of coupled ODEs have been approximated              
              using an explicit numerical integration method on both the CM-200              
              and CM-5 Connection Machines but due to the stiffness of the                   
              equations, we have been restricted to medium length simulations                
              of two-dimensional long-time simulations of both the PDE and ODE               
              formulations.                                                                  
                                                                                             
              This research will not only advance the current state-of-the-art               
              in scientific computing, but will also further our understanding               
              of cardiac dynamics under both normal and abnormal conditions.
