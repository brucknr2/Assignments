Abstract    :
              The objectives of this research are: 1. to relate the level of                 
              soil contamination to the change in frequency dependent                        
              electrical properties of the soil; 2. to establish the viability               
              of using a cone penetrometer to measure these electrical                       
              properties; 3. to develop a model for the electrical properties                
              of soil; 4. to evaluate the applicability of the electronic                    
              circuit simulator SPICE to describe the flow of electric current               
              through soil.  The research will include numerical simulation of               
              electric current flow through soil and experimental evaluation of              
              the theoretical analysis.
