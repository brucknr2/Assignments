Abstract    :
              This award will provide support for US-based scientists to                     
              participate in the International Conference on Molecular                       
              Bioinformatics, which is part of the Dagstuhl-Seminar Series.  The             
              conference will take place September 7-11, 1992, in Wadern,                    
              Germany.  The bulk of the award will support the travel costs of               
              new researchers in this area.  Molecular bioinformatics is an area             
              in applied computer science which is rapidly gaining significance              
              due to the explosion of basic data from molecular biology.  This               
              area is concerned with the development of methods and tools for                
              analyzing and understanding the relationships between and the                  
              functions of macromolecules.  The design of large biomolecules is              
              an area of increasing importance that depends critically on                    
              computation.  The workshop will be interdisciplinary (molecular                
              biology, computer science, applied mathematics).  The workshop will            
              focus on the following topics:  alignment of biomolecular sequences            
              (DNA, RNA, protein); interpreting nucleotide sequences and their               
              role in gene regulation; determining large genomic sequences by                
              shotgun and other methods such as hybridization; modeling of large             
              biomolecules, including the prediction and analysis of secondary               
              and higher-level structure as well as spatial conformations                    
              (folding); molecular dynamics and simulations of interactions                  
              between biomolecules.
