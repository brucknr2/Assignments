Abstract    :
              With the advent of high speed circuits and mixed analog-digital                
              designs, it is important to make sure designs are insensitive to               
              manufacturing process variations.  Designs must protect against two            
              types of faults: catastrophic-short and open circuits, and                     
              parametric where circuits fail due to parameters deviating too far             
              from their nominal values.  This research is on statistical                    
              simulation of analog and mixed signal systems.  Three research                 
              problems are being pursued.  First, a SPICE-based macromodeling                
              approach to reducing the simulation time of analog components is               
              being used.  An algorithm for finding the best parameters, given               
              the performance needs is being sought.  Second, both circuit level             
              and macromodel level statistical process models for analog                     
              components are being explored.  Algorithms for worst case analysis             
              and for computing parametric yield, which are attuned to the                   
              complex parameter models of the analog circuit manufacturing                   
              process are being developed.  Third, a new catastrophic fault model            
              is the basis of algorithms for efficiently computing catastrophic              
              fault coverage of test sets.  From this information catastrophic               
              yield of analog components can be computed.
