Abstract    :
              This is a proposal to develop an improved aequorin method of                   
              measuring cytoplasmic calcium levels.  Aequorin is a                           
              chemiluminescent protein extracted rom a jellyfish.  Its                       
              luminescence increases rapidly with calcium concentration over the             
              whole range found within living cells and it can be injected                   
              without disturbing their function or development.  The pattern and             
              level of luminescence which is emitted by an aequorin-loaded cell              
              serves to reveal the changing patterns and levels of free calcium              
              within this cell for days after injection.                                     
                                                                                             
              The aequorin method has several advantages over fluorescent dye                
              techniques currently used for measuring cytoplasmic calcium levels.            
              However, it requires improving for it to reach its full potential.             
              Dr. Jaffe will develop an efficient imaging system and a way for               
              mass loading of aequorin into cells, using fertilized sea urchin               
              eggs, Dictyostelium cells, and other cells.                                    
                                                                                             
              If successful, the improved aequorin method will increase our                  
              ability to accurately measure the cytoplasmic calcium levels and               
              will contribute to better understanding of many cell and                       
              developmental processes that involve calcium.
