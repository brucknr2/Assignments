Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Engineering colleges have developed a wide range of individual                 
              education and research exchange programs with institutions in                  
              Germany, some with support through such organizations as the von               
              Humboldt Foundation and the DAAD, many with State support.                     
              There is a need to assess the status of the cooperative                        
              programs between U.S. and German institutions so that                          
              successful experiences and procedures can be shared.  It is                    
              with these developments in mind that a workshop assessing the                  
              overall impact of U.S.-German cooperative programs in                          
              Mechanical Engineering is supported.                                           
                                                                                             
              There are multiple objectives for the workshop, including: (1)                 
              an evaluation of existing U.S./Germany cooperative programs in                 
              Mechanical Engineering; (2) an assessment of problems                          
              associated with developing a cooperative program; (3) the                      
              development of guidelines/procedures of the initiation of                      
              U.S./Germany cooperative programs, (4) the establishment of                    
              goals for increasing the number of cooperative programs with                   
              Germany; and, (5) the development of recommendations for the                   
              role that NSF could play in advancing international                            
              cooperation in Mechanical Engineering.  Based on the                           
              evaluation of existing programs and associated problems, goals                 
              will be established for increasing the number of U.S./Germany                  
              cooperative programs and recommendations will be offered for                   
              the role that the USA may play in advancing international                      
              cooperation with Germany.  A workshop report will be prepared.
