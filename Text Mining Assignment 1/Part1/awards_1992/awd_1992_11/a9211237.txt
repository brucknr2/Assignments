Abstract    :
              This research project, supported by the Analytical and Surface                 
              Chemistry Program, studies the dynamical behavior of tethered                  
              chromophores in self-assembled organic overlayers.  Using                      
              steady state and ultrafast laser spectroscopic probes and the                  
              evolution of fluorescence from the chromophore, the                            
              reorientation dynamics of the tethered probe molecule will be                  
              examined as a function of its micro-environment.  This                         
              information will be useful for the design of interfaces with                   
              highly specific properties.  This study will provide the first                 
              dynamical information about these interesting and important                    
              material systems.

              The molecular level organization and time-dependent behavior of                
              molecules imbedded in organic overlayers is the subject of this                
              research project.  Using short time scale spectroscopic                        
              methods, the behavior of probe molecules in self-assembled                     
              monolayers will be examined. Information about the dynamics of                 
              these organic overlayers is essential to the eventual                          
              application of these materials in useful electronic devices.
