Abstract    :
              9211914  Turner  Ocean science has a critical role in understanding the 
              biogeochemical processes involved in global change, and long-  range autonomous
              underwater vehicles (LRAUVs) are one of ocean  scientists' most promising
              tools.    However, the state of the art in intelligent control has not seen 
              application in real physical devices; that which has, been used  in
              highly-constrained environments.    This research is aimed at studying the
              problem of designing and  building an embedded, intelligent, reactive
              controller for long-  range AUVs.  This program, called ORCA, will be developed
              to  control the Marine Systems Engineering Laboratory's (MSELs) long-  range
              AUV, currently under development.  ORCA will build on  existing work in
              intelligent control, primarily drawing on the  artificial intelligence subfield
              of reactive planning.  The  investigator's previous work in schema-based
              reasoning, a  reactive planning method, will be augmented by other work in 
              planning, reasoning under uncertainty, and intelligent control.   ORAC will be
              able to create and follow mission plans to achieve  users' (scientist') goals,
              revising its plans and taking actions  as needed to cope with unanticipated
              events and the other effects  of incomplete knowledge, uncertainty, and
              interacting with a  changing world.
