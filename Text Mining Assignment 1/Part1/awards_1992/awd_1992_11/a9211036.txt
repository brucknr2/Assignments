Abstract    :
                   Research in mathematical physics will attempt to                          
              incorporate a new mathematical technique known as "quantum                     
              groups" into elementary particle physics.  Quantum groups will                 
              be formulated and computed, and non-quantum-group descriptions                 
              of certain phenomena will be modeled as appropriate limits of                  
              the quantum-group descriptions.  The project is important                      
              because, if it succeeds, it will represent an advance in our                   
              quantum mechanical description of microscopic phenomena.
