Abstract    :
                   This research involves work in four areas of probability and              
              statistics, the bootstrap, large deviations, random fractals, and              
              empirical processes indexed by sets.  Research in the bootstrap                
              area will involve investigation of the large sample properties of              
              a general weighted bootstrap, which includes the nonparametric                 
              and Bayesian bootstraps as special cases.  The research in large               
              deviations will be centered around a notion of extended                        
              functional large deviations for partial sums.  Random fractals                 
              will be studied in empirical increments of various random                      
              processes.  The behavior of tail empirical processes indexed by                
              sets will be studied with an eye towards applications, the most                
              prominent being in establishing the consistency and asymptotic                 
              distribution of various multivariate density and mode estimators.              
                   Probability theory provides a basis for research in                       
              statistics.  This research will include both the development of                
              new results in probability, as well as their application to                    
              statistical theory.
