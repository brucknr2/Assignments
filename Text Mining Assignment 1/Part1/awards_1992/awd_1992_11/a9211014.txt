Abstract    :
              Senescence is the decline in reproduction and survivorship with                
              advancing age.  There are two major evolutionary theories of                   
              senescence:  pleiotropy and mutation accumulation.  Both of these              
              theories seek to provide an explanation for the observed patterns              
              of reproduction and mortality.  Both theories suggest that                     
              senescence is an example of the failure of natural selection to act            
              against genes with late age-specific effects.  This study will                 
              investiage these two major theories using selection experiments                
              with Drosophila melanogaster.  Through a series of contrasts,                  
              between selection lines, the relative ability of either theory to              
              explain changes in late-life history patterns will be examined.                
              There have been previous studies which have examined one or the                
              other of these theories, but this will be the first time they will             
              be tested simultaneously.  The results will contribute to a general            
              understanding of animal aging.
