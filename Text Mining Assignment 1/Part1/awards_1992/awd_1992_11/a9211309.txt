Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  This is a Research in Undergraduate Institutions award (RUI)              
              to study the effect of economic development on gender inequality               
              and women's labor for participation.  The study will focus on the              
              effects of four factors on gender inequality in labor force                    
              participation and distribution, namely the effect of prior                     
              sociocultural emphasis on women's roles, the effect of a                       
              society's level of economic development, the effect of the degree              
              of society's economic dependency on other countries, and the                   
              effect of the type of trade strategy employed by a society.  A                 
              longitudinal data set containing data for 92 nations is used in                
              panel regression analyses to identify basic patterns and test                  
              hypotheses.                                                                    
                   Most research on the relationship between women's status and              
              economic development is based on case studies, and the results of              
              these studies are often contradictory.  This study, in contrast,               
              will provide a systematic analysis data for many countries over a              
              long period of time.  This is likely to clarify many of the                    
              ambiguities in previous research on economic development and                   
              gender inequality.
