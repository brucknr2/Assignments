Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The application of molecular biology and biotechnology to marine               
              organisms is beginning, and "marine biotechnology" for commercial,             
              environmental, and national security applications is emerging                  
              rapidly.  A number of exciting fundamental research discoveries in             
              marine biology were made during the last decade and more are being             
              made as research advances in a number of areas.  There is also now             
              a need to address technological and policy issues arising from                 
              these fundamental discoveries.  Marine biotechnology is at a                   
              critical juncture in the United States.                                        
              The proposed effort includes forming a committee to examine the                
              importance of marine biotechnology and key research and development            
              policy issues.
