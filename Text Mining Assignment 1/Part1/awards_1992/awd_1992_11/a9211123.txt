Abstract    :
                Recent progress in quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) methods and                     
              computer technology promises an exciting possibility of                        
              calculating the electronic structure of real materials with                    
              unprecedented accuracy.  We propose to pursue further substantial              
              development and speed-up of QMC methods including their                        
              implementation on massively parallel machines.  We plan to                     
              perform calculations for systems with transition methods which                 
              cannot be adequately described by traditional methods because of               
              strong correlation effects.  We believe that QMC methods could                 
              have a significant impact on future research of many                           
              technologically interesting condensed matter systems where the                 
              correlation effects play an important role.
