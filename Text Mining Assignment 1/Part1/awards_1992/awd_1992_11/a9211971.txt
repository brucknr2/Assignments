Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This project supports the participation of Dr.                                 
              S. A. Adediran of the Department of Chemistry,                                 
              University of Ilorin, Ilorin, Nigeria, in a                                    
              collaborative research project on the                                          
              enzymology of beta-lactam antibiotics in the                                   
              laboratory of Dr. Rex F. Pratt, Wesleyan                                       
              University, Middletown, Connecticut.  Previous                                 
              work by the PI's group has show that beta-                                     
              lactamases are inhibited by a series of                                        
              phosphonate monoester monoanions.  In this one-                                
              year collaborative effort, a series of                                         
              phosphonate peptide analogs of these                                           
              phosphonate monoesters will be synthesized and                                 
              evaluated as inhibitors of DD-peptidases.   The                                
              results promise to provide important                                           
              information on the DD-peptidase active site,                                   
              which could eventually lead to new routes for                                  
              designing antibacterial agents.                                                
                                                                                             
              The collaborative research would extend Dr.                                    
              Adediran's experience in enzyme kinetics into a                                
              more medicinal or pharmaceutical direction,                                    
              centered more on organic reaction mechanisms.                                  
              Such experience will improve Dr. Adediran's                                    
              teaching and research, and greatly enhance his                                 
              ability to initiate and coordinate future                                      
              inter-departmental research collaboration                                      
              between the College of Science and the College                                 
              of Medicine at the University of Ilorin.  The                                  
              project is consistent with the criteria for the                                
              Science in Developing Countries (SDC) program                                  
              in that it strengthens collaboration between                                   
              U.S. scientists and engineers and their                                        
              counterparts in developing countries, and                                      
              increases the capacity of scientists and                                       
              engineers in developing countries to address                                   
              constraints to development.
