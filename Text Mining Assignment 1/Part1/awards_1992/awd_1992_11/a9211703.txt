Abstract    :
                   Air-borne particles are an important and complex component of             
              the atmospheric.  Particles act as sites for water vapor                       
              condensation and thus are involved in the formation of clouds and              
              influence the properties of clouds.  The long range objective of               
              this research is to determine the role and interplay of chemical               
              constituents, such as sulfate and organic compounds, in modifying              
              the composition of particles and their ability to form cloud                   
              droplets.  A better comprehension of these interactions is required            
              in order to understand the effect on aerosols and clouds of natural            
              and anthropogenic emissions that contribute particulate matter to              
              the atmospheric.  The immediate objective of this work is to                   
              establish a foundation by investigating heterogeneous nucleation on            
              single well characterized particles.  The experimental approach                
              entails electroactive levitation of individual particles in a                  
              thermal diffusion chamber which allows for examination and                     
              unsaturated to supersaturated conditions.  Spectroscopic methods,              
              voltage balancing techniques, and measurement of nucleation rates              
              and thresholds are used to characterize the particles.
