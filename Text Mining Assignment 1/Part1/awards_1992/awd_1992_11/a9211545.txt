Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The major goal of this project is to study the membrane                        
              mechanisms involved in signalling thermal stimuli by                           
              nerve cells in the trigeminal ganglion which receives                          
              information from the face.  A novel, miniature thermal                         
              stimulator is being developed which will apply highly                          
              localized and well-controlled heat stimuli to these                            
              trigeminal sensory neurons which are maintained in a                           
              cell-culture environment.  This new instrument is based                        
              upon a commercially available miniature thermometer which                      
              utilizes a temperature-dependent change in the rate of                         
              decay of fluorescence emitted by a phosphor coating at                         
              the tip of a fiberoptic probe.  The tip of the                                 
              temperature probe functions as a black-body radiator by                        
              covering it with a layer of gold.  A new optical assembly                      
              couples the optical fiber to both a xenon flash light and                      
              an infrared laser diode.  Injection of both infrared and                       
              blue radiation into the optic fiber will make it possible                      
              to simultaneously heat the front of the probe and measure                      
              its surface temperature.  By utilizing the temperature                         
              signal in a feedback loop and pulse-modulating the output                      
              of the infrared laser diode, it is possible to accurately                      
              control the highly localized heat stimuli.  This new                           
              instrument should have many important applications in                          
              biological research.
