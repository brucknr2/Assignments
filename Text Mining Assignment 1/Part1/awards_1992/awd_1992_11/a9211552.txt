Abstract    :
              This project examines the feasibility of reducing emissions of                 
              nitrogen oxides from stationary power sources by including a                   
              catalytic reburn step in the process.  The reburn chamber would                
              be incorporated into the stack of a boiler or into a heat-                     
              recovery steam generator following a gas turbine, and would                    
              incorporate heterogeneous catalysts capable of generating methyl               
              radicals from natural gas (methane) injected into the exit                     
              stream of the combustor.  The ability of methyl radicals to                    
              reduce nitrogen oxides is already well established.  In this                   
              study, two families of catalysts known to generate methyl                      
              radicals from methane are used:  lithium-doped zinc oxide and                  
              magnesium oxide, and rare- earth oxides such as lanthana.                      
              Catalytic studies and adsorption measurements provide specific                 
              activities, activation energies, and kinetic rate expressions.                 
                                                                                             
              Infrared spectroscopy done in situ is used to characterized the                
              surface species on the most active catalysts.                                  
                                                                                             
              Successful application of this concept to power generating                     
              processes would result in an enormous decrease in nitrogen oxide               
              emissions and would probably eliminate acid rain from power                    
              generation as a major environmental problem.  It would also                    
              obviate the need for the more expensive and more cumbersome                    
              processes involving ammonia that are currently being used.                     
              Application to other industrial sources nitrogen oxides is also                
              envisioned.
