Abstract    :
              A novel table top, ultra wideband,                                             
              time domain scattering range will be                                           
              developed under this Research

              picosecond laser will be used to                                               
              switch planar antennas                                                         
              photoconductively, generating and                                              
              detecting  picosecond bursts of

              (EM) radiation.  The EM pulses will                                            
              have bandwidth extending over 10-80                                            
              GHz, and will allow one to obtain                                              
              ultra-wideband scattering data in a                                            
              single measurement.  In this work                                              
              new antennas that increase the                                                 
              radiated power and improve signal-                                             
              to-noise will be designed and                                                  
              fabricated.  These antennas will                                               
              make feasible the measurement of the                                           
              late-time response of low-Q targets.                                           
              Additionally, optical fiber will be                                            
              used to guide the optical pulses to                                            
              the antennas, yielding a system in                                             
              which the transmitter and receiver                                             
              can be moved about arbitrarily.                                                
              This new scattering range has
