Abstract    :
              The decision-making of the United States Supreme Court is of                   
              substantial interest to social scientists, journalists, and                    
              laypersons alike.  Beginning in 1983, the Law and Social Science               
              Program provided support for the construction of a multi-user data             
              base that codifies a wide range of dimensions relevant to Supreme              
              Court decision-making, and makes these data available to social                
              scientists and other parties through the Interuniversity Consortium            
              for Political and Social Research in Ann Arbor, Michigan.  This                
              grant will extend the data base and therefore, enhance scholarship             
              on the Supreme Court.                                                          
                                                                                             
              Specifically, this collaborative project with Harold Spaeth, the               
              principal investigator of the original project, will extend the                
              NSF-funded U.S. Supreme Court Judicial Data Base (now covering the             
              Warren, Burger and Rehnquist years) to encompass comparable data               
              on the official votes of the Vinson Court (1946-1953).  A second               
              extension integrates data related to the official votes with a data            
              base created by Jan Palmer that contains the justices' conference              
              voting and opinion assignments.  This data base, which encompasses             
              the Vinson Court, will be extended to include the Warren Court.                
              The resulting project will span 23 terms of the Supreme Court                  
              (1946-1968) and the behavior of the 20 justices who then served.               
              As with the original data base, these extensions will be archived              
              at the Inter-University Consortium, and will be available as an                
              SPSS export file.  The richness of the resulting data will                     
              tremendously enhance the formulation of theory and testing of                  
              hypotheses with respect to the Supreme Court.
