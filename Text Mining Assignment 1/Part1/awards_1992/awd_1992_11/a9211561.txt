Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The long-range goal of this research is to determine the basic                 
              principles of how mechanical stimuli are converted into neuronal               
              signals that result in touch perception.  Towards this end, the                
              research focusses on the Pacinian corpuscle, which is considered               
              typical of many mechanoreceptors found in the skin.                            
                                                                                             
              The research involves two major lines of investigation:                        
              (1) measurement of the mechanical and mechano-electrical properties            
              of this receptor using video microscopy, mechanical forces and                 
              displacement analysis, and electrophysiology in order to better                
              relate stimulus forces and displacements to neural response                    
              properties; and (2) to test the adequacy of the Bell and Holmes                
              model of the Pacinian corpuscle's mechanics by performing specific             
              experiments which have outcomes predicted by the model.  The results           
              obtained during the project should have significance for a more                
              general understanding of mechanotransduction which occurs in all               
              living organisms.
