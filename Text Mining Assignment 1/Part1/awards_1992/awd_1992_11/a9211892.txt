Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This project supports the dissertation research of an                          
              anthropology student from the University of Michigan.  The                     
              project is to study the effects of wage labor by junior males on               
              patterns of authority and conflict among the pastoral Samburu of               
              Kenya.  It will address issues concerning how authority is                     
              structured in households in traditional societies where the                    
              economic basis of income is changing from a traditional pastoral               
              to a wage labor economy.  Both quantitative survey methods and                 
              qualitative methods of interviews and participant observation                  
              will be used.                                                                  
                                                                                             
              This research is important because patterns of authority have                  
              been changing in traditional societies in response to changes in               
              income opportunities.  Increased understanding of the household                
              dynamics of these changes can help planners accommodate the                    
              problems which such shifts in authority entail.
