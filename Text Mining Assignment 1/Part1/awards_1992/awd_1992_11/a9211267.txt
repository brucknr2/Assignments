Abstract    :
              This project funded by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organo-                 
              metallic Chemistry Program is for exploratory research on                      
              temperature-hypersensitive photostationary states and                          
              photooscillating systems.  The basis of the proposed                           
              investigation is the observation that the photostationary state                
              for certain diacidobisbipyridylruthenium(II) complexes switched                
              from Ru(II) to Ru(III) over a remarkably small temperature                     
              interval when irradiated in chloroform solution.  There was                    
              also evidence for a photooscillation between the two oxidation                 
              states under certain conditions.  Elucidation of the mechanism                 
              of the photochemical behavior is a primary objective of the                    
              research although plans are outlined to examine other chemical                 
              systems that may behave in a similar fashion.

              This research, which deals with photochemically initiated                      
              inorganic reactions, if successful could have very significant                 
              technological applications for "smart glass", i.e., changes                    
              color with temperature, various types of sensors and switches,                 
              and possibly for mass storage applications.
