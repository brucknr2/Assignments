Abstract    :
              This project addresses the structure and stability of metal                    
              surfaces.  Part of the work deals with methods by which an                     
              equilibrium rough surface can be forced into an ordered state under            
              steady-state sputter growth conditions.  The ability to control or             
              reduce disorder by an inert technique can have important                       
              consequences for film growth techniques.  The second area of study             
              is the determination of the equilibrium crystal shape (ECS) of                 
              silver near the (110) plane.  An understanding of the ECS is a                 
              necessary prerequisite to interpretations of growth, catalysis,                
              diffusion, etc. involving the silver surface.  The final part of               
              the project deals with surface phase transitions and surface                   
              disorder transitions and surface disorder transitions occuring in              
              alkali metal surface layers on (110) substrates.  The research will            
              study the phase diagram of such transitions in the context of                  
              current theories of these phase transitions.
