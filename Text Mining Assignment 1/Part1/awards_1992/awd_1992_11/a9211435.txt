Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This work, funded by a Small Grant for Exploratory Research,                   
              explores a new statistical tool called the Minimal Spanning Tree               
              (MST).  This algorithm is capable of identifying filamentary                   
              structures as well as sheet-like structures and cell walls in                  
              astronomical positional data.  It will be used as a tool to                    
              quantify galaxy distributions in sky catalogs and red-shift                    
              surveys, as well as models and simulations of the clustering                   
              process.  The Principle Investigator has pioneered in the                      
              application of this technique to astronomical distributions.  If               
              successful, this research will open new avenues toward                         
              identifying, quantifying, and constraining the physics of galaxy               
              clustering.
