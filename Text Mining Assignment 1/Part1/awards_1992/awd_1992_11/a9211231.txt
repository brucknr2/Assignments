Abstract    :
              A distinctive and much debated feature of the US banking and                   
              financial system is the separation of commercial banking and                   
              investment banking which is legislated by the Glass-Steagall Act               
              of 1933.  Before 1933, commercial banks and their securities                   
              affiliates competed directly with investment banks in the                      
              business of underwriting and originating securities.  The purpose              
              of this project is to analyze and evaluate the arguments for and               
              against universal banking by examining the investment banking                  
              activities of commercial banks prior to the Glass-Steagall Act.                
              Information will be collected from a variety of financial                      
              publications from the 1920s and 1930s.  These data will allow the              
              comparison of underwriting activities and performance of                       
              commercial banks and independent investment banks.  The project                
              will explore the empirical relevance of arguments made in the                  
              1930s and today against universal banking--e.g., potential                     
              conflicts of interest when lending and underwriting are permitted              
              under one roof, ability to take advantage of unsophisticated                   
              depositors, and monopolistic control of access to capital markets              
              for small and medium sized firms. The arguments for universal                  
              banking include potential economies of scope in information                    
              gathering and processing.  In addition, the effect of commercial               
              banks' internal organizational structure on the performance of                 
              their investment banking activities will also be investigated.                 
              This project is particularly timely and important given the great              
              interest in banking reform.
