Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The purpose of this project is to develop techniques of nonlinear              
              time series analysis and apply these techniques to answer a                    
              number of interesting questions arising from both aggregate and                
              disaggregate economic time series.  There are two general types                
              of techniques that need to be developed: first, methods of                     
              analyzing properties of multivariate nonlinear time series models              
              and second, methods to detect and identify nonlinear structure in              
              economic time series.                                                          
                                                                                             
              The econometric tools developed in this project are applied to a               
              number of issues where linear time series models would be                      
              inadequate.  These issues include: (1) evaluating the capability               
              of a menu cost pricing and oligopoly model to explain the price                
              dynamics in a large panel of wholesale gasoline rack prices and                
              (2) examining how monetary policy affects the economy by using                 
              nonlinear vector autoregression techniques on aggregate output                 
              and on more disaggregate measures.  For example, are smaller                   
              firms more sensitive to changes in monetary policy during                      
              recessions than expansions?
