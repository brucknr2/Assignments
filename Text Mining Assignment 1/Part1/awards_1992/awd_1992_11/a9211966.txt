Abstract    :
                   Acellular bone was discovered over 100 years ago, and yet many            
              fundamental qualities of its biology remain obscure.  Acellular                
              bone comprised the skeleton of the earliest vertebrates,                       
              "heterostracans," which are now extinct.  Most living vertebrates              
              possess cellular bone.  However, one group of extant derived                   
              fishes, the Teleostei, includes many members with acellular bone.              
              Although it has been assumed to be similar in both groups, there               
              has never been a comparative study of this peculiar tissue in                  
              teleosts and "heterostracans."                                                 
                   This study addresses the development of acellular bone in                 
              "heterostracans" and teleosts in order to determine whether this               
              tissue is the same in these two distantly related groups.  Growth              
              series of heterostracan fossils will be compared to developmental              
              series of a living fish with acellular bone, Geophagus                         
              brasiliensis.  The study will focus on microscopic aspects of bone             
              such as the amount and site of cell entrapment within the hard                 
              tissues, the relative size of tooth-like structures, and how these             
              factors relate to the overall pattern of morphogenesis.  The result            
              will be the first comprehensive developmental study of earliest                
              vertebrate hard tissues.  Furthermore, it will elucidate some basic            
              aspects of the biology of acellular bone.
