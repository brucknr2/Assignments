Abstract    :
                   Fuzzy Linguistic Control is fast emerging as an alternative               
              to conventional control techniques in situations where an explicit             
              mathematical model of the plant is unavailable or difficult to                 
              formulate, and/or when performance objectives are not readily                  
              translated into standard control theoretic design objectives and               
              constraints.  These control algorithms are, however, developed in              
              a rather ad hoc and unsystematic manner.                                       
                   This project will develop a set of application selection                  
              criteria, stating the characteristics of the plant and the class               
              of performance objectives and constraints that warrant the                     
              application of Fuzzy Linguistic Control, a set of design guidelines            
              and implementation standards, and finally a set of performance                 
              evaluation criteria, enabling an methodical approach to evaluate               
              the performance of Fuzzy Linguistic Control algorithms.
