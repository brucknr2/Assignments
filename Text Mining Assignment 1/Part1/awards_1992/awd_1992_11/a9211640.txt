Abstract    :
                   This research focuses on the efficient evaluation of                      
              multidimensional integrals that arise in Bayesian analysis.  The               
              basic approach is first to select a problem-specific                           
              transformation to precondition the integrands, and then to use an              
              adaptive integration method.  The primary objective now is to                  
              investigate how best to choose transformations which will allow                
              adaptive numerical integration algorithms to be used effectively.              
              So far, transformations based on a modal approximation                         
              transformation have been shown to reduce computation time                      
              significantly for some problems.  These approximations need to be              
              refined and tested on practical statistical problems and made to               
              interface with standard statistical software packages.                         
                   Integrals play a very important role in a wide variety of                 
              practical statistical calculations; but often these integrals are              
              defined over regions in multiple dimension and do not have values              
              that can be obtained from formulas or tables.  In this case, the               
              integrals must be estimated numerically, often with time                       
              intensive computation.  New methods and refinements to be                      
              developed here will take account of special features of these                  
              statistical problems  to give efficient adaptive integration                   
              algorithms.
