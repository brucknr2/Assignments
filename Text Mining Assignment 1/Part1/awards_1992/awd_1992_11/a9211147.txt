Abstract    :
                   This award is to support a postdoctoral associate to work in              
              experimental computer science.  The associate, James Cremer, will              
              be working with Professor Joseph Kearney on simulations of                     
              complex mechanical systems.                                                    
                                                                                             
                   The research will consist of three parts.  The first will                 
              have the associate continuing development of the SimLab system                 
              that will simulate reality using computational mathematics and                 
              physics.  The second project involves collaboration with the                   
              Center for Computer Aided Design in order to incorporate                       
              engineering concerns in the development of capabilities in                     
              SimLab.  The final project involves the development of high level              
              programs to control the complex mechanisms that arise in rigid                 
              body dynamics specifications.
