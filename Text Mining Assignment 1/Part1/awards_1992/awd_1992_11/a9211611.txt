Abstract    :
                    This grant supports the research by a State University                   
              of New York at Stony Brook professor of Nuclear Chemistry who                  
              will study nuclear reactions produced by heavy ion bombardment                 
              at energies of order 50 MeV/u.  Prof. Lacey and his students                   
              will use the facilities of the National Superconducting                        
              Cyclotron Laboratory at Michigan State University for their                    
              experiments.
