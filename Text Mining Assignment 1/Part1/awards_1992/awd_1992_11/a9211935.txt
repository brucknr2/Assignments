Abstract    :
                   The research conducted in this laboratory in recent years has             
              centered on the development and application of spectroscopic                   
              methods for quantitative, state-resolved studies of ultratrace                 
              species resulting form ozone photolysis and the reactions of those             
              photolysis products with atmospherically relevant species.  The                
              current proposal represents a logical evolution of that previous               
              work to provide crucial information for resolving key atmospheric              
              issues involving ozone and critical species like CIO and BrO.                  
              Special emphasis will be placed on characterization of                         
              vibrationally excited species in order to better understand their              
              role in the atmosphere.
