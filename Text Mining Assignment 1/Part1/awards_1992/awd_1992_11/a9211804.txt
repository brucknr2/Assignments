              These activities are designed to broaden the student's                         
              understanding of technical issues as well as the                               
              rapidly changing electric power industry.  The                                 
              program will support the attendance of upper level                             
              undergraduate or master's level students.  While the

              industrial matching funds will be requested in order                           
              to increase the number of participants.
