Abstract    :
                   This award is to support a postdoctoral associate to work in              
              experimental computer science.  The associate, Calvin P. Lin,                  
              will work with Dr. Lawrence Snyder on portable parallel programs.              
                                                                                             
                   The research will concentrate on three areas:  parallel                   
              languages, parallel algorithms, and portable scientific                        
              applications.  Two parallel languages will be developed based on               
              the Phase Abstractions programming model.  This model has already              
              been shown to produce portable parallel programs for both shared               
              and distributed memory architectures.  Additionally, important                 
              scientific algorithms, such as the Fast Fourier Transform, will                
              be studied to identify the "algorithm of choice", an algorithm                 
              that is optimal on most architectures and competitive on all.                  
              Finally, work will continue on the development of portable                     
              scientific codes concentrating on a large molecular dynamics                   
              program.
