Abstract    :
              Sources of parallelism present in Prolog, including or-parallelism,            
              independent and-parallelism, and (determinate) dependent and-                  
              parallelism, will be exploited in the development of a parallel Prolog         
              system.  In this project, the stack-copying technique will be extended         
              to include both kinds of and-parallelism.  It is expected that this            
              will speed up the execution of Prolog programs because of the                  
              parallelism and fewer inferences being executed at run time.                   
              Implementation will take place on a Sequent.
