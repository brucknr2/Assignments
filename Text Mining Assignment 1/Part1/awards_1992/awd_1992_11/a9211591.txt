Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  This is a study of the role of altruism and self interest in              
              shaping behavior towards the environment.  A better understanding              
              of this relationship is important because climate change, ozone                
              depletion and loss of biodiversity all involve resources that are              
              in large part public goods.  For this reason, most mechanisms                  
              proposed to mitigate global environmental change involve public                
              policies that require a tradeoff between individual and                        
              collective costs and benefits in the provision of environmental                
              quality.  Structural equation models will be used to analyze data              
              collected in phone interviews with 500 individuals.                            
                   This study will provide baseline information on public views              
              on key global change issues, such as greenhouse warming and                    
              species loss.  The study will also contribute to our                           
              understanding of how willingness to pay for public policies aimed              
              at reducing global warming and speciesloss depend on                           
              environmental attitudes and values.
