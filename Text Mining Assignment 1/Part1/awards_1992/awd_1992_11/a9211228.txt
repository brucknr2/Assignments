Abstract    :
              Safety has become an increasingly important public policy                      
              consideration.  With enactment of the Environmental Protection                 
              Act and the Occupation Safety and Health Act in 19970, a healthy               
              and safe work place became a national goal.  The purpose of this               
              project is to analyze how a firm's financial performance affects               
              work place safety.  In particular, a model is developed showing                
              how a firm's incentives for preventing accidents depends on its                
              financial situation.  The possibility of bankruptcy means that                 
              optimal safety investments depend on such financial variables as               
              expected profits, debt burden, ability to sell assets, and                     
              expected future profits.  It is shown that it is impossible to                 
              determine analytically the direction and magnitude the effect                  
              of these factors have on investments in safety.  Answers must be               
              determined empirically.                                                        
                                                                                             
              This project will provide empirical estimates of the relationship              
              between a firm's financial condition and its investment in work                
              place safety using two plant-level proxies for safety performance              
              form OSHA records: lost workdays and violations of safety                      
              standards.  This research is important because it will have                    
              important public policy implications, most notably for the                     
              efficient allocation of regulatory resources and policies towards              
              highly leveraged transactions.
