Abstract    :
                Audio, video and graphics will play a major role in shaping the              
              evolution of computers and communications.  To this end, the                   
              formulations of new mechanisms for multimedia computing and                    
              visualization are proposed, with emphasis on time-dependent data.              
              Specific research objective are (1) the development of protocols               
              for multi-media communications. (2) the modeling of time-dependent             
              data for storage, communication, and interfaces; (3) the                       
              development of new paradigms for interactive digital video; and (4)            
              the provision of time-dependent information retrieval in a                     
              distributed database and shared-object environment.  An operational            
              distributed multi-media information system will be developed to                
              demonstrate the work.  The prototype system will be designed to                
              support scale-up for general-purpose multimedia computing including            
              computer-aided instruction and collaborative work.  Current                    
              technology will be used for data compression, communication, and               
              interface toolkits; tailored to implement the theoretical results.             
              The proposed research consists of the development of communications            
              protocols and other mechanisms to enable interactive multimedia                
                                                                                             
              computing systems.  Although many application-specific systems have            
              been developed, effective support for multimedia applications in               
              a general distributed environment is not widely studied.  This work            
              emphasizes the enabling technology rather than applications per se;            
              however, an application will be developed that may lead to                     
              innovative approaches to learning, human-computer interaction, and             
              computer-aided education.
