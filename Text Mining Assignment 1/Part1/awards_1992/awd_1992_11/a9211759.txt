Abstract    :
              The vast majority of eukaryotic cells contain many mitochondria.               
              In this organelle, the oxidation of small molecules generates                  
              cellular ATP, thus providing most of the available energy for the              
              cell.  A unique feature of mitochondria and related intracellular              
              organelles is that they are composed of two independent yet                    
              interacting membrane systems.  Embedded in both of these                       
              membranes are a variety of channel and carrier molecules that are              
              responsible for the monumental biochemical tasks necessitated by               
              this structure; the transport of highly charged molecules into                 
              and out of the mitochondria.  Many of the molecules responsible                
              for these transport processes have been identified and                         
              characterized in recent months.                                                
                                                                                             
              Many of the recent advances in the field have been made by                     
              investigators applying disparate technologies and methodologies.               
              This workshop on "Molecular Biology of Mitochondrial Transport                 
              System" will bring together scientists examining these systems by              
              different approaches to begin to identify structural similarities              
              and functionally important interactions.  Although many of the                 
              individual players are known, the nature of potential functional               
              interactions and conserved structural motifs have yet to be                    
              thoroughly explored.  It is both important and timely to bring                 
              together a multidisciplinary group of investigators examining                  
              mitochondrial transport systems by different approaches but with               
              the same overall goal.
