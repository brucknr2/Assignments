Abstract    :
                   Harrell will work on the tunneling effect of quantum                      
              mechanics and on intermittency in equations such as those arising              
              in laser physics.  Other problems involve the interplay between                
              geometry and analysis, and with attempts to understand nonlinear               
              phenomena.  Spectral theory is central to many physical problems;              
              for example energy levels in  quantum mechanics are determined as              
              eigenvalues of certain linear operators.  However, singular                    
              operators or limits lying outside the scope of well-established                
              theories often arise in applications, and motivate much of this                
              project.                                                                       
                   Modern physics, quantum mechanics and relativity, is a                    
              product of the twentieth century.  It is founded firmly in the                 
              last century's attempt to address the microstructure of matter                 
              and to come to grips with the concepts of action-at-a distance,                
              electro-magnetism, and heat radiation.  The mathematical                       
              foundations for these developments, collectively called                        
              mathematical physics, ranges from detailed analysis of                         
              Schroedinger operators, which governs the dynamics of particles,               
              to unified field theory, which attempts to unite the four known                
              forces into a single theory.
