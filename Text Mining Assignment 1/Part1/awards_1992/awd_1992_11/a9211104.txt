Abstract    :
                It has recently become possible to solve quantum reactive                    
              scattering problems within their full three-dimensional context                
              for three-atom systems with modest numbers of energetically-open               
              initial-and-final quantum states.  While a high level of accuracy              
              has been achieved for a few simple systems, there remain major                 
              impediments to the extension of these methods to the vast                      
              majority of interesting chemical reactions.  The basic                         
              theoretical and computational issues are easily characterized on               
              a qualitative level.  First, the complexity and computational                  
              intensity of current methods even for simple three-atom systems                
              challenge current generations of high-performance computers.                   
              Second, as one moves beyond these simple chemical reactions, the               
              complexity of the calculations increases tremendously because the              
              number of open initial-and-final quantum states increases by                   
              orders of magnitude.  For this reason such problems are currently              
              beyond the realm of consideration for even the most optimistic of              
              researchers.  This research will focus on developments that will               
              provide steps towards solving such problems on massively parallel              
              computers.
