Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This project is part of NSF's "Research in Undergraduate                       
              Institutions" funding opportunity.  It supports the research of                
              seven collaborating anthropologists studying the adjustment and                
              inter ethnic relations of Guatemalan, Haitian, Cuban and Mexican               
              immigrants to South Florida, and the responses to these ethnic                 
              groups by native African Americans and Hispanics.  Using survey                
              and intensive interviews schedules, the project will focus on                  
              political and economic behaviors, studying how these behaviors                 
              are maintained and revised by cultural factors such as religious               
              practices and family life, as well as social factors such as                   
              network formation, class, and relations with state agencies.                   
                                                                                             
              This research is important because the understanding of inter                  
              ethnic relations is of critical importance to modern societies.                
              Such comparative case studies will help policy makers deal with                
              feelings of unfairness and commitment to social order among                    
              diverse ethnic groups.
