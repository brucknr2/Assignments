Abstract    :
                   The objective of the research is to determine the effects of              
              suspension formulation and rheology on the microstructural                     
              uniformity of tape-cast ceramic sheets.  The two-dimensional                   
              component geometry and simple forming technique will facilitate                
              modeling of the tape-casting process.  Alumina-based suspensions               
              will be formulated that contain a bimodal molecular weight (MW)                
              distribution of polymethyl methacrylate, with either broad or                  
              narrow polydispersity.  The effects of polymer MW and distribution             
              on suspension rheology, particle packing, and the relative ratio               
              of free to adsorbed polymer in the tapes will be investigated.                 
              The microscopic distribution of ceramic particles and polymeric                
              constituents as a function of direction will be probed by                      
              themogravimetric analysis and scanning electron microscopy as well             
              as by measuring the macroscopic dimensional changes these layers               
              experience during storage, lamination, and densification.                      
              Ultimately, processes will be designed which lead to improvements              
              in the microstructural uniformity of tape-cast layers.                         
                   This knowledge will afford greater dimensional control during             
              multilayer ceramic fabrication which impacts a critical                        
              technology--multichip electronic packaging.  Tape-casting is a                 
              critical process for forming the ceramic substrates for ceramic                
              printed wiring boards and the uniformity of the sheet determines               
              the attainable wiring density.
