Abstract    :
                      This project will make the first direct measurements of a              
              low altitude atmospheric plume that has been observed in satellite             
              imagery as rising from the sea ice in the vicinity of Bennett                  
              Island in the Arctic Ocean.  It has been hypothesized that the                 
              plume consists of rapidly escaping methane released from the                   
              melting and vaporization of methane hydrates along a fault                     
              structure, but to date there has been no direct confirmation of                
              this conjecture.                                                               
                      This work will be supported under the Small Grants for                 
              Exploratory Research Program (SGER), which includes in its                     
              objectives the support of research that is risky and has severe                
              urgency with regard to availablity of facilities.  In this instance            
              the field work will be a month-long deployment of a Russian AN-2               
              aircraft to the vicinity of Bennett Island following the already               
              scheduled Arctic Gas and Aerosol Sampling Program (AGASP-4),                   
              sponsored by NOAA, in March and April of 1992.  This will take                 
              advantage of the fact that the aircraft will already have been                 
              equipped with a suite of atmospheric chemistry instrumentation, and            
              will only require the installation of a separate sample inlet line.            
                      The work will identify the composition of the Bennett                  
              Island plume, and if it is in fact largely methane, will allow a               
              determination of the age of the source hydrates.  This in turn will            
              promote the construction of a global methane budget, and assess its            
              effect as a radiatively important trace species on the global                  
              radiation budget.
