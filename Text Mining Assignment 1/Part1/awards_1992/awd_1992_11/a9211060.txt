Abstract    :
                 New applications - such as automatic knowledge discovery - are              
              making new demands on database systems. The constraints on                     
              collaborations between query optimizers and query-plan evaluators              
              in conventional database systems severely limit the use of                     
              database systems for these new applications. The award supports                
              research into unconventional kinds of collaborations between                   
              query optimizers and query-plan evaluators, including the                      
              migration of selected optimization decisions to run-time, the                  
              scheduling of multiple-implementation queries, and the migration               
              of the use of prefetch hints from the query-plan evaluator to the              
              query optimizer. The performance of the techniques is being                    
              extensively analyzed using an integrated rule-based optimizer and              
              database system simulator.  This research is expected to result                
              in more efficient designs for a new generation of more flexible,               
              high-performance database systems.
