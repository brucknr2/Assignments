Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This project develops a model which can better achieve an overall              
              integration between real and financial phenomena than the                      
              representative agent neoclassical growth model used in real                    
              business cycle analysis.  This would be an important contribution              
              because the models employed in Real Business Cycle theory appear               
              to be unable to account for the volatility of asset prices at                  
              business cycle frequency or the spread between the average annual              
              returns of Treasury Bills and the return on equities.                          
                                                                                             
              The model developed in this project differs both in its impulse                
              (recurring uncertainty) and propagation mechanisms (the choice                 
              between flexible and inflexible actions) from Real Business Cycle              
              theory.  Shocks to the economy are only partially observable.  As              
              a result, the representative agent draws an inference about the                
              true shock from those which are observable.  These inferences are              
              subject to recurring fluctuations in "confidence."  By                         
              calibrating its parameters to long-run growth facts of the U.S.                
              economy, key statistics of the actual economy are reproduced                   
              through the model economy.  More specifically, the model                       
              reproduces real magnitudes such as consumption, output and                     
              investment, and observed financial statistics on the volatility                
              of asset prices, the premium on equities, and the term structure               
              of interest rates.
