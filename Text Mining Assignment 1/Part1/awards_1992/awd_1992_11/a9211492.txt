Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              In solving a variety of problems, decision makers use scales of                
              measurement based on subjective judgments to choose among                      
              alternative plans or to select optimal strategies.  This project               
              is an attempt to understand in a systematic way the limitations                
              that properties of scales of measurement place on the conclusions              
              one may meaningfully draw using such scales in decision making                 
              contexts.  Such limitations will be examined for conclusions from              
              averaging or merging techniques used to combine individual                     
              judgments, from relative scores used to choose among alternative               
              technologies or alternative candidates, from attempts to find an               
              optimal strategy, and from models used for solving practical                   
              problems involving resource allocation, communications,                        
              transportation, technology assessment, etc.  Various theoretical               
              questions about the theory of scales of measurement that underlay              
              its use in the analysis of decision making problems will be                    
              studied, and the theory will be applied to some practical                      
              problems.
