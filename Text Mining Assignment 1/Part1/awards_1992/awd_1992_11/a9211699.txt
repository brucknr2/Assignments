Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The effect of large magnitude electric fields on polymer thin films            
              is being investigated by examining the charge distribution,                    
              symmetry, and magnitude across doped and undoped glassy polymer                
              thin films as a function of temperature, time, and poling                      
              (processing).  This is done by electrochromism, second-order                   
              nonlinear optics, isothermal current and surface voltage decay                 
              measurements.  Trapping levels and sites are also examined.                    
              Electrochromism examines the charge distribution and trapping sites            
              across doped polymer and functionalized polymer films as a function            
              of processing.  Second-order nonlinear optical techniques including            
              second harmonic generation and the linear electro-optic effect are             
              used to study the charge distribution at different penetration                 
              depths and will yield qualitative information on trapping sites.               
              Isothermal current and surface voltage decay measurements allow                
              bulk characterization of fields in contact- and corona-poled films,            
              respectively.  Dielectic relaxation provides bulk electrical                   
              property data and information concerning polymer relaxations and               
              rotational mobility of the dopants.                                            
                                                                                             
              This research represents an attempt to systematically investigate              
              the electric field properties of glassy polymer thin films.                    
              Potential applications include electric power transmission,                    
              printing technology, photonics, telecommunications, and                        
              electrophotography.
