Abstract    :
                   The engineering community needs efficient algorithms for                  
              solving global optimization problems in design.  Global                        
              optimization problems require minimizing a function possessing                 
              multiple local minima.  A practical example is finding the                     
              optimal design of a composite laminated stiffened panel used in                
              aircraft structures.  This research has three objectives.  The                 
              first is to develop a random search algorithm that includes both               
              integer and continuous variables.  A simulated annealing                       
              algorithm for mixed integer/continuous global optimization will                
              be developed, because simulated annealing has already                          
              demonstrated some effectiveness in both the integer domain and                 
              the continuous domain.  The second is to take advantage of                     
              estimates of a Lipschitz constant in the optimization algorithm.               
              The third is to decrease an algorithm's probability of getting                 
              trapped in a local minimum that is not the global minimum.                     
                   Together these objectives will improve algorithms in a                    
              manner that will make formulating and solving global optimization              
              problems more practical and accessible to engineers.  The results              
              will be applicable to aspects of design in all engineering                     
              disciplines.
