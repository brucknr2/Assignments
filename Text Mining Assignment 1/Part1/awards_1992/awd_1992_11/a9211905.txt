Abstract    :
              The main goal of this research project is determination of                     
              reaction pathways for the oxidation of nitrogen-containing                     
              organic compounds.  The effects of products of hydrocarbon                     
              pyrolysis and oxidation on the reduction of NO will be                         
              examined.  These NO reduction experiments, to be carried out                   
              in an adiabatic flow reactor operating at 800-1000C, will be                   
              conducted with both pure organic nitrogen compounds and with                   
              these compounds diluted with hydrocarbons to yield a fuel                      
              feedstream with 2-10 percent nitrogen by weight.  The gas                      
              within the flow reactor will be sampled at various axial                       
              locations using a water-cooled quartz-lined sampling probe;                    
              these samples will be analyzed simultaneously using a gas                      
              chromatograph and an NO/NOx analyzer.  The effect of the                       
              carbon-nitrogen bond on formation of NO will be studied for                    
              complex nitrogen compounds such as quinoline, benzonitrile,                    
              and urethane.  The distribution of nitrogen intermediates from                 
              these complex nitrogen compounds will be measured.  The data                   
              will be analyzed to determine the significant reaction                         
              pathways using a quasi-global model of the hydrocarbon                         
              chemistry and a detailed model of the nitrogen chemistry.                      
                                                                                             
              An important output of this study will be evaluation of the                    
              feasibility of incinerating high concentrations of nitrogen                    
              compounds.  Many waste streams from the chemical, petroleum,                   
              and pharmaceutical industries contain such organic nitrogen                    
              compounds and present particularly difficult problems as                       
              regards environmentally safe disposal.  Reaction models                        
              developed as a result of these studies will be used in design,                 
              analysis, and evaluation of procedures for proper incineration                 
              of such waste streams.
