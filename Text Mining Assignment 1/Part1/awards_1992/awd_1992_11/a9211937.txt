Abstract    :
              Recent concern over rising quantities of carbon dioxide in the                 
              atmosphere and the accompanying "greenhouse effect" has prompted               
              calls for caps on, or even reductions in, the overall output of                
              carbon dioxide from fossil fuels burned to produce energy for the              
              world economy.  This project will investigate the effects of                   
              modeling investment uncertainty in a global energy-economic                    
              interaction with varying limits on carbon emissions in different               
              regions of the world.  The project will develop a model that                   
              assumes long run economic growth maximizing decisions are taken.               
              The consistency of this objective with current economic decisions              
              will have implications for policies aimed at encouraging new                   
              technology investment, exploration for undiscovered resources,                 
              and energy saving substitutions.  The overall goal will be to                  
              determine the effect that investment with uncertain outcomes                   
              might play in limiting expected economic costs of carbon emission              
              policies.  The model will be built as an extension of Manne and                
              Richels' Global 2100 model that has already considered economic                
              effects of carbon limits without explicit random investment                    
              effects. These effects will be incorporated in the proposed model              
              that will take the form of a stochastic nonlinear program.  The                
              solution methodology will be a distributed decomposition scheme                
              that runs on a network of powerful computer workstations. New                  
              bounding techniques for expectations with limited information                  
              will be developed to bound the value of information and the value              
              of solving the complex stochastic model.
