Abstract    :
                   The past two decades have witnessed the development of many               
              Computer Aided Process Planning Systems, each of which has specific            
              advantages and disadvantages.  Among these systems there exists                
              considerable data overlap; yet the data cannot be interfaced,                  
              exchanged, integrated, or communicated because the data structures             
              are not standardized.  Only limited investigation has taken place              
              with respect to the problems, and some aspects have been ignored               
              altogether.                                                                    
                   The object of this project is to develop a test bed of                    
              integrated process planning systems, which can be used for testing             
              flexibility and data standardization of a variety of process                   
              planning functions.  The projects will be conducted in                         
              collaboration with the National Institute of Standards and                     
              Technology's process planning test bed laboratory.
