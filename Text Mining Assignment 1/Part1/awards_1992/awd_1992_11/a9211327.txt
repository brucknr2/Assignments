Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Retinal functions in both vertebrates and invertebrates are                    
              regulated by light and a circadian clock.  In the horseshoe crab,              
              Limulus polyphemus, the interactions of light and a circadian clock            
              on retinal structure and function are particularly well                        
              characterized.  The goal of these studies is to clarify the largely            
              unknown biochemical substrates and mechanisms underlying the                   
              effects of, and the interactions between, light and the circadian              
              clock on the retina.  Two interesting substrates have been                     
              identified.  One, pp46A, probably participates in a light-driven               
              pathway modulated by the circadian clock.  The other pp122, is in              
              a clock-driven pathway that is probably modulated by light.  The               
              hypothesis that pp46A quenches the transduction cascade initiated              
              by light and that pp122 is critical for clock-driven changes in the            
              structure of the photoreceptor that occur at night will be                     
              investigated.  Molecular, biochemical and immunochemical approaches            
              will be applied to characterize these proteins and their functions.            
              The interactions between light and a circadian clock in regulation             
              of proteins critical for retinal function, opsin, pp46A and pp122,             
              will be determined.  These studies will provide new knowledge of               
              the biochemical processes that underlie the day to night changes in            
              the retina that are required for normal vision.
