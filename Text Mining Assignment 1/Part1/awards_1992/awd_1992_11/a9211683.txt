Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Polymer science in this century has focused on the linear chain and            
              its derivatives such as star polymers, rings, combs, ladders, as               
              well as nonlinear extensions such as branched polymers and three               
              dimensional networks.  This is a proposal to explore the conversion            
              of molecules making up "bulk" polymers to two-dimensional forms                
              analogous to sheets with thicknesses of "oligomeric" dimension.                
              The principal investigators has already identified a possible                  
              synthetic pathway to achieve this goal but the methodology involves            
              the use of fairly complex precursors.  The work proposed here is               
              aimed primarily at the synthetic simplification of pathways for                
              two-dimensional polymers.  Specifically it is proposed to follow               
              several approaches with different levels of complexity.  One                   
              approach involves the use of smectogens with biphenylic cores, and             
              another the use of living polymerization to construct the necessary            
              reactive oligomers.  Other synthetic pathways are similar to those             
              already developed in the principal investigator's laboratory using             
              enantiomerically enriched chiral precursors.  In the new approach,             
              the requirement of enantiomeric purity is relaxed and substituted              
              for the presence of several stereogenic centers.                               
                                                                                             
              This is a Small Grant for Exploratory Research (SGER).
