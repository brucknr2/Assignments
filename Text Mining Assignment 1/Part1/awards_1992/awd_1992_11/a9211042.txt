Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This study will investigate public response to an HIV crisis                   
              communication occasioned by the disclosure that a local emergency              
              room physician carried the HIV virus.  A probability sample of                 
              households in the hospital's service area will be surveyed.  The               
              project will attempt to identify factors associated with the                   
              public's differential response to this announcement.  Among other              
              issues, the process whereby individuals construct definitions of               
              personal risk and the role of social networks as "decision framers"            
              in this process will be studied.
