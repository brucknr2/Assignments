Abstract    :
              The equipment purchased under this research equipment grant will               
              enable more extensive research into 1) real-time digital control               
              system with vision subsystem, 2) two-link flexible robot arm and,              
              3) Stewart Platform uses in milling and grinding. These studies                
              are motivated by three concerns: 1) The inability to control                   
              commercial robot arms with modern algorithms without extensive                 
              rewiring for computer interfacing; 2) The failure of many                      
              industrial systems (e.g. construction crane, tank gun barrel) to               
              satisfy assumptions common in the control literature; 3) The                   
              position inaccuracy and low force-to-weight ratio of                           
              commercial arms rendering them unsuitable for some machining                   
              applications. The results of this effort are expected to impact                
              on 1)digital control systems design and implementation; 2)                     
              industrial machining applications of parallel link manipulators                
              and 3) The extension of nonlinear control theory to previously                 
              intractable systems.***    //
