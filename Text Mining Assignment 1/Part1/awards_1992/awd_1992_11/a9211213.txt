Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The steroidogenic enzymes involved in androgen biosynthesis are                
              present and functional in the Leydig cells of rat testes throughout            
              all stages of sexual maturation.  However, the type of testicular              
              androgens secreted changes significantly with age.  Sexual                     
              maturation marks the shift from testicular secretion of 5a-reduced             
              androgens to testosterone, the principal androgen that is secreted             
              in the adult.  Although the biosynthetic pathway from progesterone             
              to testosterone has been well established, the maturational change             
              in testosterone accumulation is not fully understood.  The activity            
              of steroid 5a-reductase, an enzyme that converts 3-oxo-4-ene                   
              steroids to 5a-reduced metabolites, plays a key role in determining            
              the final steroid products secreted by the testis.  The steroid                
              products secreted may have widely differing peripheral and                     
              testicular biological actions.  In the proposed research, a                    
              polyclonal antibody to rat liver 5a-reductase will be make and used            
              to localize the protein in the testis by immunofluorescence.  The              
              levels of steroid 5a-reductase protein and mRNA in the testis will             
              be determined throughout puberty in the rat.  Results of these                 
              studies will provide a basis for studying the regulation of this               
              enzyme and the mechanisms involved in qualitative changes in                   
              steroid biosynthesis.
