Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Climatological data measured over the past 40 years at Niwot Ridge             
              show that this temperate alpine site is undergoing directional                 
              change.  Cooler, wetter conditions correlate with shifts in Plant              
              community composition, reduced soil pH and modification of                     
              controls on nitrogen limitation to vegetation.  While a number of              
              future climatic scenarios are possible, enhanced precipitation in              
              the alpine may continue the cooling trend due to increased albedo              
              and evapotranspiration.  This new research will therefore                      
              emphasize the influence of snowpack and precipitation on alpine                
              ecosystem processes and patterns.  The project group will identify             
              and quantify mechanisms controlling the alpine ecosystem response              
              to snowpack and precipitation and develop prediction models based              
              on this knowledge.  The research has four focal points:  (1)                   
              watershed-level physical and biological processes affecting                    
              geochemical budgets;  (2) plant and soil microbial processes,                  
              emphasizing organismic controls on nutrient allocation, pools and              
              fluxes, photosynthesis and net primary production;  (3) a                      
              hierarchical set of landscape analyses involving populations and               
              communities of plants and animals and employing GIS and remote                 
              sensing techniques; and  (4) paleoecological responses to changed              
              snow conditions during recent centuries and millennia.  All                    
              research areas use process-oriented models that provide analytical             
              and predictive capabilities.  Interfacing these models with GIS                
              technologies will provide spatially explicit representation and                
              provide a mechanism to scale relevant biophysical processes to                 
              regional levels.
