Abstract    :
                   Graphical models can be defined as statistical models                     
              structured in terms of conditional independencies.  These models               
              are particularly successful in representing expert systems.  This              
              research will develop Bayesian methodology including elicitation               
              of informative prior distributions, model updating and expression              
              of model uncertainty for expert systems and some generalized                   
              applications.                                                                  
                   Expert systems, which are computer programs which mimic                   
              human experts, have found both commercial and scientific research              
              application over the last decade.  Their actual use in some areas              
              has been limited because of the high level of uncertainty problem              
              solvers must deal with in problematic areas.  A rigorous                       
              probabilistic basis for expressing uncertainty can be incor-                   
              porated into these systems which will allow automated modifica-                
              tion of the system in response to new information.
