Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The 115 foot WEATHERBIRD II was purchased and partially refitted               
              as a research vessel in 1989 with private funds by the Bermuda                 
              Biological Station for Research, Inc.  It replaced a smaller,                  
              less capable research vessel.  This project will supply funds for              
              the ship's continued conversion into a more capable research                   
              vessel.  Funds will be used to add a deck house for laboratories,              
              install a bow thruster of improved maneuverability, convert                    
              unused voids into additional state rooms and improve                           
              habitability.                                                                  
                                                                                             
              The project will be under the direction of Howard S. Barnes,                   
              Assistant Director for Operations.  He is fully qualified to                   
              direct this project having considerable experience in similar                  
              work including direction of the earlier refit.
