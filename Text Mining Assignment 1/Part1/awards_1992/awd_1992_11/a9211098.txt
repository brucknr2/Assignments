Abstract    :
                The goal of this research project is to develop efficient                    
              methods for electronic structure calculations, which can be                    
              applied to large systems.  The important criterion in this                     
              context is the scaling with respect to the size of the system or               
              with respect to other fundamental parameters such as the nuclear               
              charge.  The attention will be focused both on Density Functional              
              methods and on Quantum Monte Carlo methods.  Density Functional                
              methods are appropriate for calculations requiring moderate                    
              accuracy and the optimum scaling is quadratic in the size of the               
              systems.  One of the goals of this research is to develop methods              
              that achieve that optimum.  Quantum Monte Carlo methods are used               
              where high precision calculations are required and the key                     
              scaling is with respect to the nuclear charge.  Another goal of                
              this research is to utilize pseudo potentials to reduce the                    
              effective nuclear charge.  The methods to be developed will be                 
              implemented on parallel computers.
