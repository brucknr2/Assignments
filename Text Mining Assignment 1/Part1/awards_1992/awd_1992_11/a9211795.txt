Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  This workshop discusses the role of chemical and physical                 
              processes which are of importance for the distribution of                      
              atmopsheric trace constituents and their variation in the                      
              atmopshere.  The emphasis will be on the modeling aspect of these              
              constituents.  At the workshop, the present state of knowledge will            
              be presented, key scientific issues will be identified, and future             
              research priorities will be discussed.
