Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This is an accomplishment based renewal project for the principal              
              investigator to continue his research on various topics in dynamic             
              games and implementation theory.  It includes the following topics.            
              (1)  The study extends previous research on evolutionary games to              
              allow discounting and non-infinitesimal probabilities of mistakes.             
              (2) The project characterizes equilibria in repeated games with                
              unobservable actions and no publicly observable outcomes.  (3)  The            
              analysis continues to investigate models of credit markets,                    
              contract renegotiation in multi-period models, and the                         
              implementation problem in cases of renegotiation with incomplete               
              information.  (4) The undertaking extends the Markov perfect                   
              equilibrium - an equilibrium in which strategies depend only on                
              those past variables that are payoff-relevant - to the cases of                
              incomplete information or imperfect information.  These studies                
              all deal with important topics in dynamic game theory which promise            
              to continue to help generate progress in different areas in                    
              economics as well as in other social sciences.
