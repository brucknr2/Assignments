Abstract    :
                   This award is to support a postdoctoral associate to work in              
              experimental computer science.  The associate, Grammati Pantziou,              
              will be working with Professor Donald Johnson on the                           
              implementation of algorithms developed for idealized parallel                  
              computers on real parallel computers.                                          
                                                                                             
                   The main thrust of the research is to investigate load                    
              balancing techniques.  The hypothesis is that many of the                      
              techniques will be transportable, especially those techniques                  
              that avoid concurrent references to memory.
