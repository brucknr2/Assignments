Abstract    :
              This proposal seeks funding for the 5th Van Der Ziel                           
              Symposium on Quantum 1/f Noise and Other Low                                   
              Frequency Fluctuations in Electronic Devices to be                             
              held at the University of Missouri on May 22-23,                               
              1992.  Like the previous symposia organized by the                             
              PI in October 1985, October 1986, April 1988 and                               
              May 1990, this conference will bring together                                  
              researchers from universities, industrial and                                  
              governmental research laboratories, and the industry,                          
              working in the field of Quantum 1/f Noise and other                            
              low frequency fluctuations.  To explain why funding                            
              this Symposium makes sense, this proposal focuses                              
              on the description of the present state and of the                             
              research directions in the field of Quantum 1/f Noise,                         
              although other low frequency fluctuations are also                             
              included (as in 1988 and 1990), in order to widen the                          
              scope of the Symposium and the pool of participants.
