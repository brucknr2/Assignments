Abstract    :
                   This project involves the integration of computer-aided design            
              methods and computer-aided manufacturing for the production of                 
              parts with complex contoured surface shapes.  Piecewise continuous             
              rational polynomials will be investigated as suitable functions for            
              both design and manufacture of radial plate cams.  The objectives              
              of this research are to design cam contours with high order surface            
              continuity, maintain this continuity during the manufacturing                  
              phase, and test the dynamic performance of the cams.  The test cams            
              will be compared to control samples prepared using conventional                
              design and manufacturing techniques.                                           
                   This research will determine whether typical production cams              
              can benefit from improvements in geometric design combined with                
              improved manufacturing methods.  Interpolation or approximation of             
              part contours between the design and manufacturing phases will be              
              eliminated, using polynomial control algorithms which discretize               
              the shape function to limits within the resolution of the machine              
              tool during the manufacturing phase.  Similar techniques may be                
              applied to a wide range of parts with complex surface shapes.
