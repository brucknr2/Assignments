Abstract    :
                   The proposal plans an examination of nonlinear,                           
              dissipative and non-equilibrium systems in the                                 
              magnetosphere. Recently studies have shown that a system                       
              with complex behavior may have a simply dynamical                              
              description and that experimental data can be used to                          
              reconstruct the system dynamics, thus gaining insight into                     
              the physics of complex nonlinear systems, independently of                     
              particular modeling assumptions. Using these techniques, the                   
              time series data of a single dynamical variable can be used                    
              to obtain the fractal dimension, Lyapunov exponents, etc. If                   
              the system is low dimensional and thus has a small number of                   
              degrees of freedom, its dynamics may be described by a                         
              nonlinearly coupled set of a few ordinary differential                         
              equations, which can be constructed from time series data.                     
              These equations can then be used for prediction, which                         
              however would be limited because of the chaotic behavior,                      
              and a predictability time scale can be defined by a                            
              comparison of the predicted and observational data. Analysis                   
              of magnetospheric activity using geomagnetic data has shown                    
              a low-dimensional chaotic behavior, and thus its dynamical                     
              equations can be constructed. We propose to develop                            
              nonlinear dynamical models using the phase space                               
              reconstruction techniques in the solar wind--magnetosphere                     
              coupling and stellar variability. The implications of such                     
              nonlinear dynamical techniques for the study of                                
              astrophysical and space physical phenomena is the prime                        
              focus of the proposed research.
