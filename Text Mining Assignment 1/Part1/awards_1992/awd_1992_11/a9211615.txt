Abstract    :
              This project is in the general area of analytical and surface                  
              chemistry and in the subfields of gas phase ion chemistry and mass             
              spectrometry.  During the tenure of this three-year continuing                 
              grant, Professor Grimsrud and his co-workers will conduct a series             
              of investigations aimed at elucidating the fundamental kinetic and             
              equilibrium processes governing complex ion-ion and ion-molecule               
              reactions at pressures approaching one atmosphere.  The goal of                
              this project is to explore the analytical utility of instruments               
              that operate in this pressure regime.

              The successful attainment of the goals of this project will                    
              provide a substantive framework for the rational design and                    
              optimal utilization of analytical instruments that operate at                  
              significant pressures, particularly those essential to the rapid               
              and reliable characterization of environmentally important trace               
              species.
