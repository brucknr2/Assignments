Abstract    :
              The goal of this research is to develop a                                      
              comprehensive theory for designing and analyzing                               
              adaptive systems for identification, filtering and                             
              control of unknown linear stochastic systems.  The                             
              focus of this proposal is to investigate several                               
              fundamental aspects of stochastic adaptive system                              
              theory, including adaptive solvability, convergence,                           
              performance, and robustness.  The specific                                     
              problems addressed include recursive identification,                           
              adaptive feedback an feedforward control, adaptive                             
              filtering and state estimation, adaptive channel                               
              equalization, adaptive echo cancelling, adaptive                               
              active noise cancelling and vibration control.                                 
              Under the topic of adaptive solvability, we examine                            
              the fundamental issue of whether there exists a self-                          
              tuning algorithm which automatically tunes itself to                           
              the correct controller or filter based on on-line                              
              data, given a filtering or control objective and                               
              certain a priori information.  Under the topic of                              
              performance, we consider the issue of asymptotic                               
              behaviors of signals and parameter estimates for a                             
              variety of adaptive algorithms and configurations.                             
              Under the topic of robustness, we propose to                                   
              investigate several robustness enhancement                                     
              methodologies, including the filtering of adaptive                             
              algorithms, a new H00 identification procedure,                                
              adaptive control based on instrumental variable                                
              identification methods and adaptive internal model                             
              control.  In addition to theoretical research, this                            
              project will maintain close ties with several applied                          
              research projects which include the applications of                            
              active noise cancelling and vibration control,                                 
              applied research in smart and adaptive structures,                             
              research in ghost cancellation in digital high                                 
              definition TV, and research in automatic vehicle                               
              control.
