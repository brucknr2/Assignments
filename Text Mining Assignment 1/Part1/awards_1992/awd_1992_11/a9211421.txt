Abstract    :
              Lift planning is becoming more complex, and owner tolerance of the             
              risk of catastrophic damage to their operating facilities is                   
              decreasing.  These problems have motivated planner to explore the              
              use of computer technology to aid the lift planning process.  The              
              objectives of this research are to:                                            
                                                                                             
              1.   Develop preliminary and detailed crane and object locating and            
                   object lift path planning algorithms in two and three                     
                   dimensions respectively.                                                  
                                                                                             
              2.   Explore means of applying the algorithms developed above to               
                   multiple lift planning, fleet selection, and lift dynamic                 
                   control.                                                                  
                                                                                             
              3.   Recommend ways of extending the methods developed in this                 
                   research to automated task and motion planning for                        
                   construction robotics.
