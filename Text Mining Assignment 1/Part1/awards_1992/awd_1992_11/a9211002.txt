Abstract    :
                   The goal of this project is to improve the current technology of          
              semantically-driven global program restructuring, enabling its                 
              practical application in reducing software maintenance costs.                  
                   Software maintenance is disproportionately costly, and it has             
              been observed that structural degradation is the primary, but                  
              unavoidable, cause.  The only alternatives are to reimplement the              
              system or to restructure it.  Restructuring is the more attractive             
              approach, though it is a complex activity requiring tool assistance to         
              manage consistency of changes dispersed through the program text.              
              Recently, methods have been developed for tool-assisted                        
              restructuring, and a prototype has been built and tested.  However,            
              the current methods do not fully address module-level restructuring            
              or performance issues of interactively manipulating semantic                   
              information.                                                                   
                   To make these techniques practical, this project endeavors to             
              design and implement global module transformations, increase the speed         
              of the tool by incrementally updating data structures, and enhance the         
              restructuring tool with structural analysis tools and a visual front-          
              end to support higher-level transformations.  The results are expected         
              to be natural adaptations of existing results in restructuring,                
              compilers, programming environments, and program understanding.                
                   The result of the research will be a tool employing these                 
              techniques, allowing high-level interactive restructuring of programs,         
              and showing that structure is not an inherent barrier to software              
              maintenance.
