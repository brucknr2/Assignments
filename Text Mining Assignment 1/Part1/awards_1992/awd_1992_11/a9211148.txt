Abstract    :
                Adaptive finite element techniques provide a reliable, robust,               
              and efficient means of solving the complex partial differential                
              equations that arise in practice.  Likewise, parallel computation              
              is becoming indispensable in the solution of modern large-scale                
              scientific engineering computational problems.  We propose to                  
              investigate parallel and adaptive procedures for solving vector                
              systems of three-dimensional time-dependent parabolic equations.               
              With a goal of developing the most efficient techniques, we will               
              emphasize adaptive procedures that include both mesh modification              
              (refinement and coarsening) and variation of the order of the                  
              finite element procedure.  In a similar spirit, we will                        
              concentrate on massive parallelism using SIMD and MIMD                         
              architectures.                                                                 
                Resulting software will be capable of solving problems on                    
              arbitrary three-dimensional problem domains using a finite octree              
              automatic mesh generation procedure.  This tree structure, which               
              manages data associated with mesh generation and adaptive mesh                 
              refinement, with further be used to schedule parallel processors               
              so that loading is balanced and to map spatial regions to various              
              parallel architectures.  Likewise, we will explore procedures                  
              that utilize the a posteriori error estimates, furnished with the              
              adaptive software, to estimate the work remaining in different                 
              portions of the problem domain and schedule processors                         
              accordingly.
