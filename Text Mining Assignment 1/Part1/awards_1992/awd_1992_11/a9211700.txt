Abstract    :
              The Dichrostachys group includes five genera of legumes with                   
              centers of diversity in Madagascar and subtropical North America.              
              The New World genera have been well-studied, but species and                   
              generic limits are poorly understood in the rarely collected                   
              Malagasy genera.  The proposed research will investigate                       
              evolutionary relationships among species in the five genera,                   
              integrating data from morphology, pollen, chloroplast DNA, and                 
              floral development.  A phylogenetic tree will serve to clarify the             
              generic limits, as well as provide a framework for study of the                
              evolution of pollen and floral development in legumes.  This study             
              should also provide new insights into the biogeographic                        
              relationships of tropical North American legumes.  Some neotropical            
              species in this group are being developed as forage legumes, and               
              one temperate species as perennial food crop.  It is possible that             
              the as yet unstudied Malagasy species could likewise provide food              
              and forage legumes.  In addition, the proposed field work in                   
              Madagascar will contribute primary data on the infrequently                    
              collected legume flora of Madagascar.  This study represents a                 
              significant development in the use of molecular character systems              
              in the Mimosa subfamily of legumes, and is the first time that                 
              characters involving floral development have been intergrated with             
              morphological and molecular characters in a systematic analysis.
