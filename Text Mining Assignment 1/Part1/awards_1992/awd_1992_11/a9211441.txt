Abstract    :
              The Department of Chemistry at Montana State University, which                 
              is an EPSCOR state, will use this award from the Chemical                      
              Research Instrumentation Program to help acquire a Fourier                     
              transform infrared (FTIR) Spectrometer.  The areas of chemical                 
              research that will be enhanced by the acquisition include                      
              measurements of:  the motions of non-rigid molecules, proton                   
              glasses, low frequency vibrations in organometallic complexes,                 
              corrosion of metal surfaces, general organic and inorganic                     
              chemical systems, and secondary structures of membrane protein                 
              receptors.                                                                     
                                                                                             
                                                                                             
              %%%                                                                            
              Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy is a technique                  
              that uses absorption of infrared energy to probe molecular                     
              structure.  When used in conjunction with a modern computer,                   
              FTIR studies on large numbers of samples can be conveniently                   
              carried out and the resulting data readily analyzed.  The use                  
              of FTIR spectroscopy is essential to chemists who are carrying                 
              out research in many important frontier areas.
