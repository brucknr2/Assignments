Abstract    :
              Temporal information processing underlies various kinds of                     
              intelligent behaviors, including hearing and vision.  A neural                 
              network framework for segmenting and recognizing complex temporal              
              patterns is proposed.  Processing of temporal segmentation is based            
              on the idea that segmentation is expressed by synchronization                  
              within each segment and desychronization among different segments.             
              Each segment becomes an input to the recognition network that                  
              explicitly encodes neighborhood or topological relations of local              
              features of the input, and recognition is based on the graph                   
              matching method.  To cope with problems embedded in time, the                  
              network to constructed codes time explicitly.  Multiple temporal               
              patterns are segregated into different segments that are activated             
              alternately in the time domain.  The network is able to recognize              
              complex temporal patterns, and recognition is invariant to                     
              distortions of time intervals (time warping) and to changes in the             
              rate of presentation .  The network will be tested for both neural             
              plausibility and computational effectiveness.  Results of this                 
              project will provide new computational principles that might be                
              used by the brain to process temporal segmentation and recognition.            
              Also, they will provide effective methods for solving technical                
              problems indispensable in real time continuous auditor pattern                 
              recognition.
