Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The proposed research will use molecular genetic variation among               
              modern humans to learn about the demographic history of our                    
              species. This will involve three steps: (1) collect a world-wide               
              sample of human mitochondrial and nuclear DNA, (2) score the                   
              individuals in this sample for a large number genetic                          
              polymorphisms, and (3) refine the statistical methods used in                  
              analysis of such data.  The pilot project proposed here will                   
              complete work on step 1, but will only begin work on steps 2 and 3.
