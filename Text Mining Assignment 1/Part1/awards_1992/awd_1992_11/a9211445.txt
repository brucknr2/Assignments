              of eight US scientists to attend the

              Carolina State University are the conveners of                                 
              the conference. The objective of the workshop                                  
              is to provide a forum to review and discuss the                                
              current state of physical processes within the                                 
              earth-atmosphere systems, their impact on the                                  
              ecological system as a result of complex                                       
              interactions and feedback processes and                                        
              remedies to be sought to preserve the quality                                  
              of the atmosphere.  The workshop deliberations                                 
              should lead to recommendations on more wide-                                   
              spread utilization of existing technologies to                                 
              cope with energy requirements in the immediate                                 
              future; and the development of new                                             
              energy/industrial/agricultural technology that                                 
              will avoid the threat to our ecological system.                                
                                                                                             
                                                                                             
              Scope:  The workshop is highly relevant to                                     
              scientists from the US and India since it will                                 
              synthesize information on global and regional                                  
              climate variability and discuss sustainable                                    
              development and energy use measures that need                                  
              to be taken into account by countries adversely                                
              affected by climate change scenarios.  Common                                  
              issues to be addressed include forest and                                      
              coastal zone management, groundwater storage,                                  
              adaptation to likely shifts in agricultural                                    
              patterns and aquatic productivity associated                                   
              with the expected rise in global temperature                                   
              from the greenhouse effect.
