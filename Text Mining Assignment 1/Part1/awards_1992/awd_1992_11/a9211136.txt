Abstract    :
                   This award is to support a postdoctoral associate to work in              
              experimental computer science.  The associate, Marcos                          
              Salganicoff, will work with Dr. Ruzena Bajcsy on problems                      
              involving robot control and planning.                                          
                                                                                             
                   The research will blend learning, data structures, and                    
              parallelism.  Planning information will be stored in binary trees              
              (such a k-D-trees or quadtrees).  This information, usually                    
              massive amounts of it, is then used in learning algorithms.  A                 
              hybrid approach using distributed workstations for some of the                 
              computation and a MIMD computer for some of the rest will be                   
              employed to implement these learning algorithms in a cost                      
              effective manner.
