Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                                                                                             
                  This is a study of active labor market policies, such as job              
              placement, job training, and job creation policies in 17 nations               
              from 1950 to 1988.  Active labor market policies consist of                    
              direct government intervention into labor markets for the primary              
              purpose of reducing unemployment.  It presumes that participants               
              are ready and willing to work.  Labor market policies constitute               
              the most active policy in the otherwise passive welfare state                  
              repertoire, because its goals are to make the labor force more                 
              flexible in adjusting to the restructuring of the domestic and                 
              international economies.  The focus of the study is to examine                 
              the relationship between the political and economic                            
              characteristics of a society and its labor market policies.  Data              
              from official statistics in the 17 countries will be analyzed                  
              using time-series models, pooled cross-sectional models, and a                 
              combination of regression analysis and institutional analysis.                 
                   This study will make a major contribution to the                          
              understanding of the conditions under which governments will                   
              develop active welfare state policies aimed at reintegrating                   
              citizens into the labor market rather than relying on more                     
              passive policies such as welfare benefits.
