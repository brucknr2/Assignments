Abstract    :
              This research focuses on reductions between sets from                          
              different complexity classes, such as many-one, Turing, truth-                 
              table, and other, as well as considering  sets from most basic                 
              complexity classes, including probability classes like R and                   
              BPP, and sparse sets and tally sets.  When are such reductions                 
              possible?  When they are, how efficient they can be?  The                      
              ultimate purpose is to make as many connections as possible                    
              between different complexity classes, to bring them closer or                  
              further apart, depending on the cases.                                         
                                                                                             
              To be more specific, one research direction is to find what                    
              consequences can be derived from a given set being reducible                   
              to a sparse set, or to a tally set.  For example:  Is it                       
              possible that an NP-complete set is reducible to a sparse set?                 
              What are the consequences, using various type of reductions.                   
              Is it possible that all BPP sets are reducible to sparse sets?                 
              to tally sets?  If it is, that would mean that in some way,                    
              randomness can be simulated by another type of resources.  Can                 
              one reduce the problem of building a one-way function to some                  
              other complexity class?  Can one prove that this reduction                     
              must be to a very dense set?  How efficiently can one reduce                   
              on NP-complete set to another one.
