Abstract    :
              The discipline of timing management is the key to the effective                
              design of any large scale computer systems in this era of advanced             
              technology.  It has been pointed out by Sutherland recently that               
              the current design framework which employs a globally clocked                  
              timing discipline has reached its limit.  It was demonstrated that             
              there are many advantages if a different timing discipline, namely,            
              the transition-signal conceptual framework is used to design                   
              complex computation systems.                                                   
                                                                                             
              In this research, we take a bottom up approach to accomplish the               
              synthesis of micropipeline processing systems from a high-level                
              specification.  The first milestone is to examine the design and               
              building of micropipeline structures using differential CMOS logic             
              instead of static CMOS logic.  The second milestone is to implement            
              an automatic synthesis system for a particular micropipeline                   
              stage's logic processing block given a set of logic equations.  The            
              third milestone is to implement all necessary token control                    
              circuitry.  The last milestone is to map a dataflow graph which                
              specifies a particular algorithm into hardware using the                       
              micropipeline design frame work.
