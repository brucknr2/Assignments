Abstract    :
              Many applications of geometric modeling in manufacturing or for                
              visualization require tangent plane continuous surfaces to                     
              interpolate data.  While a number of algorithms exist that guarantee           
              local, analytic smoothness, the resulting surfaces often have                  
              undesirable extraneous features when compared to a (nonsmooth)                 
              piecewise linear surface.  Such features are inflection, sharp                 
              changes of curvature, bulging between the data sites, etc.  The                
              functional and aesthetic implications of these 'shape defects' on the          
              modeled object can be severe.  This project will pinpoint sources and          
              nature of the features for specific surface constructions and devise           
              algorithms to systematically modify data and/or the underlying surface         
              representation in order to reduce or remove the features.  In                  
              particular, the research will build on the experience with a number of         
              algorithms and will investigate and quantify the effects of:                   
              1. a change of continuity constraints across patch boundaries, in              
              particular, the choice of reparametrization; 2) a perturbation of the          
              location of data sites and normals; 3) a change of the representation          
              of the patches; in particular, changing from a polynomial to a                 
              rational representation; 4) a perturbation of the neighborhood                 
              relations between the data, such as remeshing by removing or inserting         
              boundaries.
