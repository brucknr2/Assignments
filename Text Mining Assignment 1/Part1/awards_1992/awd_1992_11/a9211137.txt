Abstract    :
                   This award is to support a postdoctoral associate to work in              
              experimental computer science.  The associate, Naveen Sharma,                  
              will work with Dr. Paul S. Wang on finite element analysis in the              
              context of high performance computing.                                         
                                                                                             
                   The research will consist of a multi-faceted approach to                  
              finite element analysis combining symbolic, numeric, and parallel              
              computing techniques.  The research will bring computer science                
              expertise to engineering applications.  The research will bring                
              both ease of use and high performance to a larger group of                     
              scientists and engineers.
