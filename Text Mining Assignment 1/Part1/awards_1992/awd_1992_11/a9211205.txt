Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                                                                                             
                                         ABSTRACT                                            
                                                                                            
              This award will allow the publication of Africanisms in Afro-                  
              American Language Varieties, a book which contains revisions of                
              papers presented at the International Round Table on Africanisms               
              in Afro-American Language Varieties held at the University of                  
              Georgia in 1988, sponsored by the NSF.  The contributions are                  
              organized thematically, so that the book may be used more                      
              efficiently as a standard reference on the genesis of Atlantic                 
              creoles than as simple conference proceedings.  Despite its                    
              title, Africanisms fosters a dialogue between the African                      
              Substrate Hypothesis, the Language Bioprogram Hypothesis (now                  
              improved into the Lexical Learning Hypothesis), and the                        
              Superstrate Hypothesis.  The book is a turning point for the                   
              Substrate Hypothesis, highlighting the enormous complexity of the              
              subject matter of creole genesis, and suggesting for future                    
              research analyses that are much more eclectic and sophisticated                
              than those in the literature.  The book will contribute to a                   
              wider dissemination of new research avenues and conceptual                     
              adjustments.
