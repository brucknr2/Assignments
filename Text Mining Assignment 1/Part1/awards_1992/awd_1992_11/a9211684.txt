Abstract    :
              The purpose of this RIA award is to develop an integrated program              
              of mechanical testing and analytical modeling to better predict                
              the behavior of textile composites.  This scheme will be used to               
              establish a method for designing three-dimensional fiber                       
              architectures analogous to those currently used to design play                 
              orientations and stacking sequences in laminar composites.
