Abstract    :
                   This award is to support a postdoctoral associate to work in              
              experimental computer science.  The associate, J. Ross Beveridge,              
              will be working with Dr. Takeo Kanade at Carnegie Mellon                       
              University in the Robotics Institute.  He will be working in the               
              area of parallel languages and software development environments               
              for computer vision.                                                           
                                                                                             
                   The research will focus on the needs of computer vision.  In              
              particular low-level and intermediate-level computer vision.  The              
              goal is the development of a coherent parallel environment that                
              is independent of any particular parallel architecture.  The                   
              intellectual contribution of this research will be better                      
              understanding of how to support computer vision in parallel                    
              environments.  A concrete product of this research will be a                   
              pilot system implemented on a new Sony parallel computer.
