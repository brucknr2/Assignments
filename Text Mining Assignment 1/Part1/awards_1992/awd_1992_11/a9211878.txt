Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                   This action is for travel support for American scientists to             
              participate in a symposium on the interplay between the nervous,               
              endocrine and immune systems to be held in conjunction with the                
              annual meeting of the American Society of Zoologists in Vancouver,             
              British Columbia. State-of-the-art lectures will be held on (1)                
              behavioral regulation of immunity and (2) mechanisms and                       
              consequences of central nervous system and immune system                       
              interactions.  The emphasis of these presentations is on the                   
              use of diverse biological systems.  The goal of this meeting is to             
              encourage greater research participation by zoologists in this new             
              and expanding field.  The hope is that conveying the conceptual and            
              empirical advancements in psychoneuroendocrinology will lead to the            
              development of new experimental approaches which, in turn, will be             
              used to unravel the complex mechanisms, pathways and feedback loops            
              that serve to communicate interactions between these three systems.            
              Elucidating the basic mechanisms underlying stress and                         
              developing coping strategies will be one outcome of a better                   
              understanding of this intimate relationship between the neural,                
              endocrine and immune systems.
