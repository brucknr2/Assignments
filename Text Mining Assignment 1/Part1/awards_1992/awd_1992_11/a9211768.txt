Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This project will continue the research activities of the Hubbard              
              Brook Long-term Ecological Research project (HBR-LTER), expanding              
              upon the original theme, the effects of natural and anthropogenic              
              disturbances on the structure and function of northern hardwood                
              forest ecosystem.  Through an integrated program of monitoring and             
              process-level studies the investigators will examine four                      
              principal categories of disturbance:  (1) silviculture and land-               
              use, (2) air pollution, (3) changes in atmospheric CO2 and                     
              regional climate, and (4) irruptions of heterotrophic organisms.               
              Monitoring of hydrometerology, ecosystem chemistry and biotic                  
              activity will be continued and expanded.  Together with detailed,              
              process-level studies this will allow the testing of hypotheses                
              concerning, (1) responses of vegetation, forest floor, organic                 
              debris dams and biogeochemistry to clearcut harvesting, (2)                    
              effects of land-use changes in the Hubbard Brook Valley and the                
              larger Pemigewasset-Merrimack Basion on ecosystem structure and                
              function, (3) changes in loading of acidic deposition and                      
              responses of biogeochemical cycles, (4) ecosystem processing of                
              trace metals, (5) carbon budget effects on and responses to                    
              changing atmospheric CO2 and regional climate, (6) interactions                
              among breeding birds, phytophagous insects and vegetation                      
              structure and production, and (7) growth and longevity of fine                 
              roots and belowground herbivory.  The research will be integrated              
              using several new and existing ecosystem models.
