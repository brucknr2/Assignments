Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This study brings together different facets of capital management              
              policies.  Specifically, it investigates structural estimation of              
              investment, capital retirement, and exit decision rules of plants              
              using data from the U.S. cement industry.  The data available                  
              covers 1973-80 and spans the oil-shock period.  Because cement is              
              a very fuel intensive product, a marked increase in investment,                
              capital retirement and plant closings in the cement industry were              
              observed during this period.                                                   
                                                                                             
              Compared to the existing empirical models of investment, the                   
              salient features of this project are that it allows for a more                 
              flexible adjustment cost function, endogenous capital retirement               
              and endogenous exit of plants.  Methodologically, a stochastic                 
              dynamic programming model within an iterative estimation procedure             
              will be solved numerically.  A sensitivity analysis will be                    
              conducted using the estimates obtained to quantify the responses               
              of investment, capital retirement and plant closings to changes in             
              demand and cost parameters as well as to policies such as the                  
              investment tax credit and depreciation allowances.
