Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  Markov chain models of complex stochastic systems are often               
              characterized by large stat spaces, resulting in computational                 
              difficulties in their numerical solution.  Rank reduction                      
              algorithms alleviate the diseconomies of large\scale by decomposing            
              the given problem into a set of smaller subsystems.  This work                 
              facilitates the implementations of various iterative rank reduction            
              algorithms with respect to efficiency and usability.                           
                   A major contribution of this work is the development of                   
              heuristic methods for decomposing large state of spaces into small             
              subsets.  The main approach is based on analyzing individual                   
              errors.  Scientists and engineers attempting to analyze complex                
              stochastic systems will benefit from the availability of powerful,             
              user friendly methods such as the ones developed in this work.
