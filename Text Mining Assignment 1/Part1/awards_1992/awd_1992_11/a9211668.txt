Abstract    :
              This research is on finding efficient techniques for producing                 
              solutions to logic synthesis and physical design problems both                 
              simultaneously and interactively.  Two problem areas are being                 
              investigated: integrating logic synthesis with physical design; and            
              layout algorithms for Boolean networks.  In the first area, a                  
              prototype synthesis system which is capable of making synthesis                
              decisions based on both logic level information and detailed data              
              about the interconnecting wires and characteristics of the physical            
              media is being developed.  The key idea is to generate a placement             
              of the Boolean network that captures the structure of the layout.              
              The correspondence between logic and layout representations is                 
              maintained during iterations.  Both technology independent and                 
              technology dependent logic transformations are accommodated.  In               
              the second area, ways to assign the I/O pads or place the nodes of             
              an unmapped Boolean network, where the nodes still have technology             
              independent logic realizations, are being investigated.  Physical              
              design tools which effectively capture the structural                          
              characteristics of Boolean networks and can handle nodes of inexact            
              or approximate area, intrinsic delay and drive are being developed.            
              Accurate and efficient modeling of interconnect during logic                   
              synthesis and layout plays a key role in the algorithm development.
