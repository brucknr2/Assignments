Abstract    :
              This project is a nondestructive testing method based on the use               
              of transient stress waves, to determine the quality of bond at                 
              interfaces in layered structures, such as in bridge decks with                 
              overlays, or at an interface between repair concrete and the                   
              parent concrete in the structure being repaired.  Research                     
              includes numerical, laboratory, and field studies to determine                 
              which factors, such as porosity and tensile strength, at an                    
              interface have the most significant effects on the reflection and              
              transmission of stress waves incident upon the interface.  Three-              
              dimensional, dynamic, finite element models will be used to                    
              simulate the impact-echo response of layered structures                        
              containing various interface conditions.  These numerical studies              
              will be complemented by laboratory studies in which specimens                  
              with different interface conditions will be constructed and                    
              tested using the impact-echo method.  The bond strength at the                 
              interfaces in the specimens will be determined using commercially              
              available bond test equipment to determine whether any                         
              information can be gained through correlating bond strength at an              
              interface with impact- echo results.  The numerical and                        
              laboratory studies will establish the basis for using the                      
              impact-echo technique for determining bond quality in existing                 
              structures.
