Abstract    :
              Mammalian cells are subjected to a                                             
              wide variety of shearing,                                                      
              stretching, and deforming forces                                               
              during their growth in large scale                                             
              bioreactors, artificial tissue                                                 
              structures, and in native tissue                                               
              structures.  Mechanical forces can                                             
              deform cellular structures, causing                                            
              generation of intracellular                                                    
              messengers, alterations to                                                     
              metabolism, and cell-cycle                                                     
              transition.  The goal of this                                                  
              project is to quantify the extent                                              
              and regulation of cellular function                                            
              by physical deformation of                                                     
              membrane/cytoplasm structures.
