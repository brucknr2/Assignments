Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  This award is to support a postdoctoral associate to work in              
              experimental computer science.  The associate, Robert H. Klenke,               
              will work with Dr. James Aylor on problems involving automatic                 
              test generation using parallel computers.                                      
                                                                                             
              The research will be to generate automatic test patterns for VLSI              
              devices using parallel computers.  Current state-of-the-art test               
              pattern generation algorithms are primarily implemented on single              
              processor computers.  Because VLSI devices are increasingly being              
              incorporated into products and because the size of recent devices              
              requires long running times on even high speed serial computers,               
              it is important to make use of the new generation of parallel                  
              computers.  This postdoctoral associate will be developing a                   
              complete parallel automatic test pattern generation and fault                  
              simulation system.
