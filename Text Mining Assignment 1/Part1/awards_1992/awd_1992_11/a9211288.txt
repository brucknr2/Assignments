Abstract    :
              The process of volume rendering is increasingly used for a                     
              wide range of scientific visualization application as well as                  
              for the generation of complex synthetic scenes.  However, the                  
              process of viewing which constitutes the most crucial phase in                 
              rendering is also memory intensive and time consuming.  This                   
              project investigates new ways to expedite volume viewing by                    
              exploiting coherency and redundancy in the volume data.                        
                                                                                             
              In particular, the objectives of the proposed research are to:                 
              (1) develop methods to exploit coherency between rays,                         
              (2) develop methods to exploit coherency between frames,                       
              (3) develop methods to accelerate ray traversal by utilizing                   
              the empty space, (4) speed up recursive ray tracing to                         
              precomputing view independent attributes and partial coverage                  
              information, and (5) assemble the technology into a rendering                  
              toolkit that will be used for the construction of application-                 
              specific volume rendering environments.                                        
                                                                                             
              This research is expected to produce a portable rendering                      
              toolkit delivering faster than ever high quality volume                        
              rendering.  It is anticipated that the toolkit will find a                     
              wide use in visualization, education, and graphics.
