Abstract    :
              The main objective of the proposed work is to gain an                          
              understanding of the mechanisms involved in heat transfer to                   
              boundary layers with local, periodic unsteadiness caused by                    
              vortex shedding. In particular, the study will attempt to                      
              separate the effects of the unsteadiness from those of the                     
              background turbulence, for a flow around an obstacle                           
              projecting through the boundary layer. The main experimental                   
              technique to be used will be simultaneous measurements of                      
              velocities and temperatures within the flow field using a                      
              turbulent heat flux probe. Reynolds heat flux and Reynolds                     
              stress, mean and time resolved Stanton number measurements                     
              will be obtained.
