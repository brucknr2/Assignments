Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The Third Biennial Mammalian Developmental Genetics Workshop will              
              be held in Bar Harbor, 8-12 September, 1993.  This Third Workshop              
              builds on the highly successful workshops held in Bar Harbor in                
              1989 and 1991.  Emphasis will be placed on the mouse as a model                
              species.  The program will consist of keynote presentations, topic             
              sessions, and 'brainstorming' sessions.  Keynote presentations will            
              provide an overview of broad developmental questions; topic                    
              sessions will emphasize specific developmental problems; and                   
              'brainstorming' meetings will emphasize strategies for studying                
              important but poorly understood developmental problems.  For the               
              Third Workshop, the keynote presentations will focus on genes that             
              control mouse development and on the genetics of human birth                   
              defects; topic sessions will focus on the genetics of hearing and              
              vision, gene expression in early development, the genetic control              
              lineage determination and the genetic control of sex determination             
              and gametogenesis; and 'brainstorming' sessions will focus on the              
              developmental impact of environmental insults and on the genetic               
              control of programmed cell death.  Each topic session will begin               
              with an invited 60 minute presentation providing an overview of the            
              research problems and progress for the subject of that section.                
              These overviews will be followed by two or three 20 minute, more               
              narrowly focused, complementary presentations.  Presentors will be             
              selected by the Organizers form attendee applications.  Attendance             
              will be limited to 110.  Participation of graduate students and                
              postdoctoral fellows is encouraged.  Abstracts will be provided to             
              attendees but will not be published.  Poster presentations are                 
              encouraged.
