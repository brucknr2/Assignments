Abstract    :
                   This award is to support a postdoctoral associate to work in              
              experimental computer science.  The associate, Farid Alizadeh,                 
              will be working with Dr. Richard Karp at the International                     
              Computer Science Institute in Berkeley, California.  The                       
              associate will be investigating parallel implementations of                    
              combinatorial optimization problems.                                           
                                                                                             
                   Areas to be investigated include areas of interest to                     
              molecular biologists involving a generalized parallel                          
              implementation of the traveling salesman problem, areas with                   
              applications to circuit layout including parallel implementations              
              of graph partioning and bisection algorithms, and areas of                     
              interest to operations research analysis including parallel                    
              implementations of new maximum flow algorithms.
