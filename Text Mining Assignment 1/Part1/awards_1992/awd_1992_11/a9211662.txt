Abstract    :
              The aim of the proposed research is to answer several questions                
              regarding adequately formalizing common sense reasoning.  There                
              will be three steps.  First, to evaluate and classify some of the              
              knowledge representation languages, in particular, to compare                  
              various semantics of logic programs and develop benchmark programs             
              that distinguish them.  Second, to consider features that are not              
              handled by the traditional nonmonotonic formalisms and suggest                 
              methods to handle them.  The particular features considered are:               
              defining the consistency of a set of default and strict rules, and             
              being able to infer new defaults from a set of default and strict              
              rules.  Third, to develop a prototype system to answer queries with            
              respect to more general knowledge representation language than can             
              be handled by the systems developed so far, in particular, to                  
              follow the lead of systems based on the well founded semantics of              
              normal logic programs to develop a prototype system to answer                  
              queries with respect to the well founded semantics of a default                
              theory.  The significance of the proposed research is that if                  
              successful it makes both theoretical advances in formalizing common            
              sense reasoning and provides a prototype implementation of query               
              answering system for a more general formalism.
