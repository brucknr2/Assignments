Abstract    :
              A Research Initiation Award will support a study of compressible               
              squeeze film dampers.  The transient and steady state forced                   
              periodic responses of pressurized and unpressurized compressible               
              squeeze film dampers will be investigated over a wide range of                 
              parameters.  The study will combine analytical evaluations using               
              the non-linear unsteady finite-length Reynolds equation and                    
              experimental studies in a specialized test rig to be built as part             
              of the study.
