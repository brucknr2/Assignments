Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This award covers tasks necessary to terminate the North Inlet LTER            
              Site.  Termination requires 1) archiving and documenting core LTER             
              datasets compiled under previous NSF grants, and 2) synthesizing               
              completed data into research papers to be submitted to ecological              
              journals.  Data from this research site uniquely represent                     
              estuarine ecosystems and must be properly archived and documented              
              for future use.  Approximately two thirds of the core datasets are             
              compete to February 1992.  Several datasets (meiofauna, macrofauna,            
              zooplankton, rainfall chemistry) require additional processing and             
              analysis.  This award will permit completion of all core datasets              
              to February 1992 by the end of the award period.  Samples will be              
              archived and stored at the Baruch Field Laboratory for future                  
              reference.  All documentation will be made accessible to other                 
              scientists in electronic or hardcopy versions and provided to the              
              LTER Network Office.  Long-term data sets will be synthesized in a             
              few integrative publications to be submitted to key ecological                 
              journals.  Synthesis will focus on inter-relationships among core              
              datasets, issues related to variability, and evaluation of                     
              ecological theory.
