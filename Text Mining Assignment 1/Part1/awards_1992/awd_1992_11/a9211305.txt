Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  This award provides partial support for three summer                      
              workshops on field methods research.  The workshop will provide                
              training and instruction for 15 advanced sociology graduate                    
              students or junior faculty each year.  The workshop will focus on              
              direct field work experience and individualized session with a                 
              faculty mentor.  The participants will meet three times a week                 
              for 4 1/2 weeks in two-hour seminar sessions.  The seminars will               
              be devoted to discussions of epistemological, technical, and                   
              ethical issues in field work, to the teaching of methods of                    
              analyzing qualitative data, and to ongoing discussions of the                  
              participants experiences in their field research.                              
                   There is a great deal of interest in research using field                 
              work methods in the sociological research community, but most                  
              graduate programs provide very little formal training in these                 
              methods of data collection and in the analyses of qualitative                  
              data.  This workshop will provide much needed systematic training              
              and teaching for up to 45 advanced sociology students.  The                    
              workshop should greatly improve the quality of sociological                    
              research based on field work methods.
