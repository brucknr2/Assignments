Abstract    :
                Parallelism inherent in the computationally intensive problems               
              arising in the simulation of advanced electron devices will be                 
              identified and exploited for the development of novel software                 
              tools.  Advances, both in the optimization of algorithms for use               
              on specific machines such as a MasPar MP-1216, as well as in the               
              simulation of hitherto unexplored device phenomena are targeted.               
              Previous research involved the development of a numerically                    
              intensive simulator for quantum transport in nanostructured                    
              semiconductor devices.  A rich set of matrix problems drawn from               
              this work, including complex valued linear systems solutions,                  
              eigenvalue problems as well as QR, and SV decompositions on                    
              regularly structured matrices, have been identified as candidates              
              for future work on parallel processing machines.  Quite similar                
              matrix problems arise also in the treatment of electromagnetic                 
              waveguides, and the scope of this work can be readily expanded                 
              to include problems in this field as well.
