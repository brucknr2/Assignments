Abstract    :
              The workshop's goal is to highlight new developments in the area               
              of structural optimization, particularly those involving topology              
              optimization methods.  The main topics are:                                    
                                                                                             
              Optimal design of trusses and layout theory                                    
              Discrete optimization methods for topology optimization                        
              Relaxation methods for topology optimization                                   
              The role of composite materials                                                
              Topology optimization in a computer-aided-design environment.                  
                                                                                             
              The workshop is highly interdisciplinary: it involves both                     
              mathematicians and engineers, including specialists in                         
              mathematical programming, computer aided design, sensitivity                   
              analysis, composite materials, and the calculus of variations.
