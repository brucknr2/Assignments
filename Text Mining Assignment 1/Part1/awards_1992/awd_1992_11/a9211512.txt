Abstract    :
              9211512  Russell       This is a REU supplemental award to IRI-9211512.  The 
              objective of the RALPH (Rational Agents with Limited Performance  Hardware)
              project is to understand the effect of limited  computational resources on the
              design of optimal decision-making  systems.  Work to date has specified a
              normative theory of  metareasoning to control computation, and has applied it
              to several  combinatorial problem classes; in all cases significant performance
               improvements over standard algorithms have been record.  The  methodology for
              applying the theory has been developed in detail,  and has been used by other
              researchers to solve complex problems.   The PI will continue to work on more
              general decision-theoretic  metalevel architectures; probabilistic planning and
              scheduling  systems; and composition of real-time systems, for which 
              preliminary results have been obtained.  A software environment  will be
              developed that allows complex real-time agents to be  constructed automatically
              from elementary soft-real-time  components.  A final element of the proposal is
              the construction of  provably optimal bounded agents.  Working initially in a
              class of  simple rile-based machines, it will be shown that a learning 
              algorithm can converge quickly to an approximately optimal rule  set.  These
              results will be extended to find the scope and limits  of adaptive methods for
              achieving bounded rationality, thereby  contributing to the foundation for a
              science of artificial  intelligence.
