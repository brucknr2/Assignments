Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              In this research project, a theoretical basis is developed for                 
              the solution of a set of nonlinear equations which are used for                
              the design and analysis of mechanical systems. The approach                    
              allows a rapid numerical determination of all possible solutions.              
              The main advantage of having all possible solutions is that                    
              design optimization can be performed simply by selecting the best              
              from amongst alternative solutions. For equations with symbolic                
              coefficients, the  method yields a mathematical model from which               
              theoretical advances can be derived. The solutions of the system               
              equations are formulated with physical system parameters                       
              expressed as literal coefficients of a characteristic matrix or                
              polynomial. Whereas the results are generated in the context of                
              analysis and design of linked mechanisms, e. g., a serial                      
              jointed manipulator, they are applicable to a wide variety of                  
              engineering problems.***  //
