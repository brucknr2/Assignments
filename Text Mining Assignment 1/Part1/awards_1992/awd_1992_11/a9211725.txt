Abstract    :
              Madisetti         This research is investigating a new method for the 
              computation of the Radon transform and its inverse that avoids a  number of
              problems associated with conventional methods.  These  include sensitivity to
              noise, necessity for interpolation, and  significant amounts of computation. 
              The discrete Fast Radon  Transform (FRT/IFRT), as this method is called,
              provides an  increased flexibility in sampling, in addition to a dramatic 
              reduction in the computational complexity.  The basic approach  taken is to
              apply advanced signal processing techniques in the  frequency domain to the
              reconstruction problem.  Use of  optimization methods and the properties of
              discrete periodic  signals, result in a rich theory for the FRT/IFRT. 
              Experimental  results have validated theoretical analyses of its performance.
