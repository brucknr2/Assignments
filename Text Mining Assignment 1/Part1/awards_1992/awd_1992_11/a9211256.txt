Abstract    :
              The long-term objective of this project is to predict the final,               
              tertiary structure of a protein given its amino acid sequence.                 
              Protein folding is the final step in translating the genetic                   
              message encoded in the DNA into a functional product.  This                    
              structure is very specific:  the mutation of a single amino acid               
              residue in one protein can cause transformation or eliminate                   
              viability of an otherwise healthy cell.  Although a very large                 
              number of protein sequences have been determined, only several                 
              hundred protein structures have been solved to atomic resolution.              
              Because the three-dimensional structure of most proteins is                    
              determined by the amino acid sequence, it must be possible to                  
              predict this structure from the primary sequence.  This award                  
              investigates several unique approaches to this prediction                      
              problems:  determination of protein secondary structure using                  
              novel neural net and artificial intelligence techniques,                       
              determination of the tertiary structure of omega loops based upon              
              amino acid rotamer libraries and constraints built into the                    
              structure of the omega loops themselves, and prediction of                     
              hydrophobic core residues in proteins.
