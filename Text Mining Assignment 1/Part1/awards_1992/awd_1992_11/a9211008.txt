Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  This award is to support a postdoctoral associate to work in              
              experimental computer science.  The associate, Michael Fagen,                  
              will work with Dr. Robert Cartwright on problems involving                     
              compilers for parallel languages.                                              
                                                                                             
                   The research involves using type information to aid the                   
              programmer and to allow efficient compilation.  The original                   
              research was done with functional sequential languages.  The                   
              proposed research will be to extend these results to imperative                
              parallel programming languages.  In particular, the Program                    
              Composition Notation (PCN) language will be used as a testbed for              
              the postdoctoral associate's ideas of migrating soft typing from               
              the sequential functional domain to the parallel domain.
