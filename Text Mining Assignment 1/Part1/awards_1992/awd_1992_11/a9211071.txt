Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The advent of the Intel Delta machine, a large-scale parallel                  
              computer with powerful i860 nodes and high speed communications                
              between the nodes, combined with fast algorithms in computational              
              fluid mechanics, will allow unprecedented explorations, via                    
              numerical simulations, of complex flows with and without solid                 
              boundaries.                                                                    
                                                                                             
              Our computational method is based in the Lagrangian description                
              of the vorticity field.  Computational elements of vector-valued               
              vorticity are convected with the local fluid velocity and the                  
              vorticity vector is continually strained by the local velocity                 
              gradient.  The classical vortex method is enhanced to account for              
              viscous effects.  An adaptive, fast algorithm has been                         
              efficiently implemented in two-dimensions, in both vector (CRAYS)              
              and parallel (Mark III hypercube) architectures allowing                       
              unprecedented simulations using up to O(10 6) computational                    
              elements.                                                                      
                                                                                             
              We propose to extend the viscous technique to three-dimensional                
              flows in the presence of arbitrarily-shaped solid bodies and                   
              implement a fast three-dimensional algorithm on the Delta.  We                 
              expect to obtain computing speeds that are much higher than those              
              of a serial supercomputer speed at a fraction of the cost,                     
              allowing simulations using up to O(10 6) computational elements                
              for three and two-dimensional simulations.  This capability will               
              allow large scale extended numerical simulations, in two and                   
              three dimensions, for laboratory Reynolds numbers and should lead              
              to significant breakthroughs in the understanding and control of               
              complex flow phenomena that are fundamental to unsteady bluff-                 
              body flows.
