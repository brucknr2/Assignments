Abstract    :
                   This award is to support a postdoctoral associate to work in              
              experimental computer science.  The associate, John I. Woodfill,               
              will work with Dr. Harlyn Baker on problems in real time vision.               
                                                                                             
                   The research will consist of explorations of vision                       
              algorithms suitable for manipulating unmodeled, flexible objects               
              in dynamic, unstructured environments.  The test device for this               
              research will be a robotic grasping system.  The vision component              
              of the system will be a collection of modular vision subsystems                
              that compute summarizations of camera data to be used in                       
              controlling robot actions.  An initial challenge will be to                    
              control a flexible manipulator in grasping a flexible object.
