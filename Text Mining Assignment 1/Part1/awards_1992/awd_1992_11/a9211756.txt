Abstract    :
                   Leavenworthia, a small genus of mustards, includes a number               
              of species that exhibit varying levels of specialization for                   
              self-fertilization.  This presents an opportunity to understand                
              the origin of selfing and subsequent modification of floral and                
              genetic structure.  To accomplish, however, it is essential that               
              rigorous hypotheses of infra-generic phylogeny be developed.                   
              This research proposes to use variation in restriction sites in                
              chloroplast and nuclear DNA within an parsimony/out-group                      
              analysis of phylogeny.  The results will then be used to explore               
              adaptive radiation of selfing and its adaptive significance.                   
              Correlations of floral characters will be sought to understand                 
              how selfing originates and expands within a single phylogenetic                
              lineage.  Electrophoresis of enzymes will be used to determine                 
              effectiveness of those traits in selfing.
