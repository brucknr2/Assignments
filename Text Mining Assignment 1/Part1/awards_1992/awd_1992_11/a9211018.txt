Abstract    :
              Research is proposed for the study of                                          
              optical waveguides fabricated by low-                                          
              energy electron irradiation of silica-based                                    
              glasses.  Recent work has demonstrated                                         
              that the refractive index increase resulting                                   
              from irradiation may be used to fabricate                                      
              low-loss optical waveguides.  The                                              
              objectives of this research will be the                                        
              characterization of structural changes in                                      
              the glass, measurement of optical                                              
              properties of the irradiated material, and                                     
              application of the technology to the                                           
              fabrication of active and passive                                              
              waveguide components.
