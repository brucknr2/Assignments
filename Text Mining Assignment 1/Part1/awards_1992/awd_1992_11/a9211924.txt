Abstract    :
                   Comparative research on the development of modern welfare                 
              states treats the U.S. welfare state as an aggregate, and often                
              this work must discard the U.S. case in any testing of                         
              hypotheses because it is exceptional.  This holds true for those               
              theories which argue that welfare states have resulted primarily               
              from the exercise of power by social democratic parties.  Since                
              the New Deal, the role of state governments in welfare activity                
              has grown.  Yet, there has been no explicit geographical study of              
              the formation of the U.S. welfare state, especially in terms of                
              variation at the state level.  This research project will use a                
              number of theories to examine the geographical dimensions of the               
              U.S. welfare state from the 1930s to the 1960s.  Programs for                  
              unemployment insurance, aid to families with dependent children,               
              and general relief will be analyzed across states over time in                 
              order to determine whether they conform to one of three models of              
              welfare state development.  Welfare program variables will be                  
              examined using pooled cross-sectional time series analysis in a                
              time dependent analysis.  The results will be used to test                     
              hypotheses about the regional structure of U.S. politics over the              
              time period in question, and to assess the effectiveness of                    
              competing explanatory models in different regional contexts.                   
                   This research will make an important contribution to an                   
              understanding of the causes of welfare state formation in the                  
              United States.  It will be the first extensive longitudinal                    
              analysis of the applicability of competing theories of welfare                 
              state formation across different regional divisions.
