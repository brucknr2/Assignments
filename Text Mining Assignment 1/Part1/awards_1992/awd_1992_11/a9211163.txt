Abstract    :
              This research has two complementary tracks; automatic generation               
              of analog macromodels, and algorithms for analog multi-level                   
              simulation.  The focus of the first track is on integrating                    
              macromodel optimization techniques with algorithms capable of                  
              generating macromodel topologies.  Algorithms for generating analog            
              macromodels from circuit level representations are being sought.               
              Software embodying the algorithms is tailored to fit into an                   
              ordinary simulator's description language (e.g. SPICE3).  A set of             
              macromodels for common analog functions is being constructed.  The             
              critical problem for analog multi-level simulation is the inclusion            
              of behavioral models in a simulation environment.  Issues being                
              addressed are: the use of "C" language, simulation synchronization,            
              and circuit partitioning.  A second problem is the inclusion of                
              digital blocks in the multi-level simulation system.  Here signal              
              conversion from one domain to another is being explored.  One                  
              approach being investigated is obtaining an extension of                       
              conventional Boolean algebra to real valued signals.  This offers              
              a simple way to include both analog and digital functions in a                 
              unified simulation environment.
