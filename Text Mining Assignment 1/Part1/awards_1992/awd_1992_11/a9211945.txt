Abstract    :
              This project has both basic and applied aspects.  One of the most              
              important basic research developments in population ecology in the             
              last decade has been the increased use of modeling techniques that             
              encompass population structure, I.E., the distribution of                      
              individuals into age classes, size classes or developmental stages.            
              Matrix population models are one of these techniques, one                      
              particularly suited to inter-population comparisons and to                     
              stochastic analysis.  The research proposed here will extend the               
              basic theory for comparative analysis to permit evaluation of the              
              population-level effects of environmental factors, and will                    
              explicitly connect matrix population models to stochastic models               
              for the growth and extinction of small populations.  Each aspect of            
              this project contributes to an important applied problem.                      
              Measuring the responses of populations to environmental factors is             
              essential for evaluating the impact of pollutants, possible                    
              climactic changes, harvesting, biological control and other                    
              anthropogenic effects.  The results of this project will be                    
              directly applicable to such studies.  The problem of extinction of             
              small populations is crucial to population viability calculations              
              in conservation biology.  The models currently used for such                   
              analyses ignore population structure, which may have important                 
              effects on viability.  The results of this project will be directly            
              applicable to such situations.
