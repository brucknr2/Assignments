Abstract    :
              This research focuses on resonance suppression design in flexible              
              mechanical systems. Specifically, the research will investigate                
              the feasibility of including solid supports to vibration                       
              structures to provide damping and additional stiffness under                   
              large  amplitude vibration conditions. To design such a system                 
              requires apriori establishment of analytical relations                         
              between system geometry and eigenvalues as governed by moving                  
              boundary partial differential equations. This will                             
              be done during the course of the mathematical modeling and                     
              computer simulation effort. The results are expected to provide                
              guidelines for using solid supports and adjusting design                       
              variables for eigenvalue placement as well as extending knowledge              
              of non self adjoint partial differential operators *** //
