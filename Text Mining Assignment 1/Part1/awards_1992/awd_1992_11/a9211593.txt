Abstract    :
              In this proposal we motivate an                                                
              operator condition central to the                                              
              resolution of robust design issues                                             
              connected with (1) design of a                                                 
              computationally simple adaptive                                                
              identifier used in many practical                                              
              adaptive infinite impulse response                                             
              (IIR) filtering applications; and                                              
              (2) design of robust tracking                                                  
              controllers for uncertain plants                                               
              having possibly unstable inverses.                                             
              Our proposed study will involve a                                              
              thorough investigation of the                                                  
              aforementioned operator condition.                                             
              The primary objective is to focus                                              
              on the development of coherent                                                 
              design and robustness analysis                                                 
              methodologies which meet the needs                                             
              of the problems stated in the                                                  
              foregoing.
