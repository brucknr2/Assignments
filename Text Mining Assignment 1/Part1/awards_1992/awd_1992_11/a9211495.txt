Abstract    :
              Kim         This research focuses on digital filtering in a Block  Transform
              Domain (BTD). Such an approach can offer performance  improvements close to the
              data compression ratio without  significantly increasing the system cost. This
              is because when  the number of bits used in the signal representation is
              reduced,  the errors due to finite precision computations can be reduced 
              through proper bit allocations within the transform coefficient 
              representations and filtering computations and by eliminating  intermediate
              steps such as an inverse block transform.         Mathematical descriptions and
              properties of the BTD filters  are being examined. Minimum roundoff filter
              design are also being  investigated for state-space and lattice as well as FIR 
              structures in the block transform domain. In order to implement  the resulting
              nonuniform precision computations, a Block  Parallel, Bit-Serial (BPBS)
              approach is proposed. The resulting  structure is regular and permits faster
              computation by taking  advantage of the compressed signal representation.
