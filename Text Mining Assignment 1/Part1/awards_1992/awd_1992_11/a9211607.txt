Abstract    :
                   This award supports basic research in theoretical nuclear                 
              physics.  A reassessment of the pion-coupling constant will be                 
              undertaken and research in relativistic nuclear many-body                      
              physics is proposed which will extend the Dirac-Brueckner                      
              approach to nuclear collisions and will seek to include the                    
              density dependence of meson masses and coupling constants.
