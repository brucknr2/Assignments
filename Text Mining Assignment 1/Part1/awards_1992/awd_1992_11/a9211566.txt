Abstract    :
              This is a 1992 RIA Award.  The objective of                                    
              this proposal is to generate intense terahertz                                 
              bandwidth microwave radiation pulses form                                      
              semiconductor photovoltaic devices, and apply                                  
              it to the study of transient electric and                                      
              optoelectronic properties of dielectric materials                              
              under an extremely high field with a                                           
              contactless approach.  The technique consists                                  
              of using a picosecond laser beam to illuminate                                 
              semiconductor solar cells, and generates                                       
              electron magnetic radiation produced by rapid                                  
              current transients due to optical injection of                                 
              free carriers into the static electric field.  The                             
              radiation is directional and diffraction-limited.                              
              Since the microwave energy comes mainly                                        
              from the static energy stored in the                                           
              semiconductor devices rather than from the                                     
              incident laser energy, with the proper design                                  
              of device structure and high external bias, the                                
              total power of the radiation can well exceed                                   
              the incident power of the laser beam.  A                                       
              study of the power scaling properties suggests                                 
              that the scaling up to GigaWatt peak powers                                    
              is feasible in semiconductor photovoltaic                                      
              structure sizes up to 100 cm2.  It is possible                                 
              to study transient electric and optoelectric                                   
              properties of dielectric materials under an                                    
              extremely high field with a contactless                                        
              approach, and to pursue a new subject:                                         
              nonlinear microwave measurement of dielectric                                  
              materials.
