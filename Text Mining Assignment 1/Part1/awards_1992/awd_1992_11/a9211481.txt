Abstract    :
              This project considers the estimation of motion in a time-varying              
              image sequence, and its applications in video compression.  The                
              proposed approaches are based on a transform domain motion                     
              representation which describes the spatial displacement field of               
              a moving object by a set of transform coefficients, each specifying            
              the contribution of a basic motion to the apparent motion.  The                
              difficulty with using such an object-oriented motion representation            
              for images containing multiple objects with mixed motions is                   
              countered by a joint motion estimation and object segmentation                 
              procedure in a multi-resolution quad-tree structure.  The proposed             
              project consists of two parts.  The first part includes theoretic              
              and algorithmic investigation on, 1) viable motion transform bases,            
              2) transform domain motion estimation, 3) hierarchical, joint                  
              motion estimation and object segmentation, and 4) motion                       
              compensated temporal interpolation.  The second part encompasses               
              the studies on low bit rate object oriented video coding using the             
              techniques produced in the first part.                                         
                                                                                             
              Results from the first part will contribute to the theory of image             
              sequence processing and analysis, and will provide new solutions               
              to several key elements in video signal processing and three                   
              dimensional scene analysis and object tracking.  The success of the            
              second part, in particular, will suggest new alternatives to low               
              bit rate video coding which is indispensable for video coding over             
              narrow band channels and video database applications.
