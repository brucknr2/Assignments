Abstract    :
                A major challenge in neural network research is to build models              
              that are simple enough for analysis but describe the biological                
              behavior of the network and can be tested experimentally.  Recent              
              experimental and theoretical studies of small neural networks                  
              make the building of such models possible.  In the proposed                    
              research we will build a detailed biological model of the pyloric              
              Central Pattern Generator of the lobster.  This model will be an               
              extended version of the Hodgkin-Huxley model which includes the                
              important currents and synaptic connections.  Using methods from               
              dynamical system theory and physical approximation we will obtain              
              a simpler model which still describes the experimental results.                
              A phase model will be developed from the full model.  The effects              
              of synaptic modification and changes of intrinsic properties of                
              the neurons will be tested, and the effect of neurotransmitters                
              will be investigated.  The theoretical study will combine                      
              analytical and numerical methods from neural network and                       
              dynamical system theory, numerical simulations and will be                     
              compared to neurobiological experiments.  The research will                    
              contribute to bridging the gap between regular neural network                  
              models and the biological reality.
