Abstract    :
                 This research investigates the use of robotic hands in                      
              automated robotic assembly.  In many assemblies, the clearances                
              allowed between mating parts are smaller than the uncertainties                
              associated with a robotic assembly cell and though it is possible              
              to reduce these uncertainties by using special purpose mechanisms              
              and high precision fixturing devices, this limits flexibility and              
              increases cost.  It is preferable for the manipulator to use                   
              force/torque feedback during the execution of assembly mating                  
              operations to reduce alignment errors between parts which are                  
              caused by the uncertainties.  By incorporating a robotic hand                  
              into the robot manipulator system, the performance of the                      
              assembly cell will be improved.  The accuracy of force/torque                  
              measurements will be increased by putting sensors on both the                  
              manipulator and the hand.  The hand will serve as both a general               
              fixturing device so that the grasped part can be held rigidly                  
              during assembly and a micromanipulator so that fine adjustments                
              to the position of the grasped part can be made.  The central                  
              goal of this project is a general and automated method for                     
              synthesizing force/torque guided motion strategies which operate               
              on a manipulator/hand system and are capable of reducing                       
              uncertainty-induced errors during assembly execution. //
