Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              An international symposium on the molecular genetics of root                   
              development support November 6-8, 1992 at New York University will             
              be partially.  The meeting is designed to have a workshop-like                 
              atmosphere, featuring discussions of the recent results and new                
              approaches in the area, and will include a major emphasis on the               
              use of Arabidopsis thaliana as an experimental organism.  The main             
              objective of this meeting is to bring together, for the first time,            
              investigators from around the world who are working in this                    
              relatively new and growing field and to promote the exchange of                
              ideas and the establishment of collaborative efforts.  In addition,            
              this meeting designed to help expose other plant biologists to the             
              ways in which root development can be used to study basic questions            
              in plant morphogenesis.
