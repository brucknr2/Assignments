Abstract    :
                   Research in theoretical physics will cover a wide variety                 
              of topics, including superstring and supersymmetry theory,                     
              lattice field theory, perturbative quantum chromodynamics,                     
              collisions involving elementary particles, collisions                          
              involving nuclei, statistical mechanics, and other problems.                   
              This broad research program includes efforts to unify our                      
              description of all the forces, attempts to better understand                   
              the behavior of the elementary particles, and studies which                    
              illuminate basic physical principles by revealing their                        
              consequences in interesting physical situations.
