Abstract    :
                   This award will support a two year long-term visit by                     
              Professor John G. McHaffie, Department of Physiology, Medical                  
              College of Virginia, Virginia Commonwealth University to Japan                 
              for a cooperative research project with Professor Masao Nortia,                
              Department of Anatomy, School of Medicine, Niigata University.                 
              The researchers plan to undertake a study of direct and indirect               
              corticotectal relationships.  Study of interactions between                    
              cerebral cortex and superior colliculus are extremely important                
              because this is the circuitory which controls visual orienting                 
              movements and foveation eye movements.  Indirect pathways act in               
              a permissive manner, while the direct pathway acts in an active                
              manner.  There is little understanding of the anatomical and                   
              physiological details of these two systems.  The researchers will              
              study the functional significance of the indirect pathway from                 
              the cortex via the basal ganglia to the substantia nigra of the                
              tegmentum and thence to the superior colliculus.                               
                   Results of the research will provide valuable insights into               
              commonalities among the different sensory systems, with added                  
              information regarding the interface between sensory and motor                  
              (striato-nigral) systems.  The results may have major                          
              implications for understanding the disorder of Parkinsonism.                   
              Professor McHaffie is an experienced electrophysiologist who has               
              participated in several neuroanatomical studies.  Professor                    
              Norita is a well-established neuroanatomist with a distinguished               
              laboratory and the appropriate institutional resources available               
              for the research.  The researchers' previous record of successful              
              collaboration and their common interests should provide a                      
              mutually beneficial interaction.
