Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The National Research Council (NRC) will continue its activities in            
              support of the U.S. Global Change Research Program and related                 
              international research programs, through its Committee on Global               
              Change Research (CGCR).  This Committee will advise Federal                    
              agencies through the interagency Committee on Earth and                        
              Environmental Sciences (CEES) Working Group on Global Change on                
              scientific planning for the U.S. Global Change Research Program.               
              The CGCR will: (1) formulate scientific recommendations for                    
              coordinating the U.S. Global Change Research Program with                      
              internationally planned activities; (2) provide liaison between                
              international and U.S. planning efforts by serving as the U.S.                 
              national committee for the international programs on global change;            
              and (3) hold frequent meetings with representative of the CEES                 
              Working Group on Global Change to assure coordination of NRC                   
              activities and to communicate science needs of the U.S. Global                 
              Change Research Program.  The CGCR will coordinate its activities              
              with those of other NAS/NRC boards and committees working in                   
              related areas, and will develop a comprehensive NAS/NRC proposal,              
              to be submitted to the Federal agencies for FY 1992 funding, that              
              will encompass all NAS/NRC activities undertaken primarily for                 
              issues related to global change.
