Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The primary objective of this research is to thoroughly describe the           
              main neuroanatomical characteristics of the brain of the Florida               
              manatee in order to understand how this endangered species                     
              experiences its environment and why it behaves as it does.  The                
              manatee's habitat is being degraded at an alarming rate, and it may            
              become extinct within the next 2 decades.  This aquatic herbivore              
              belongs to a unique Order of mammals (Sirenia) and is closely                  
              related to elephants and hyraxes.  Its brain is relatively small,              
              unlike those of porpoises and seals; externally, the manatee brain             
              appears to be relatively simple in appearance in keeping with is its           
              behavior. However, research from this laboratory has shown different           
              parts of the manatee brain are quite elaborately organized,                    
              suggesting a high degree of complexity.  Some brain areas are common           
              to all mammals, while others are unique to the manatee.                        
                                                                                             
              Ongoing research involves the completion of analysis of the manatee            
              brain and the publication of two major manuscripts to describe and             
              portray all of the important external and internal features of the             
              entire manatee brain.  Comparison of the manatee brain with those of           
              several other mammals will provide clues about the anatomical basis            
              of the manatee's unusual sensorimotor activities, as well as the               
              evolutionary relationships of the manatee with other mammalian                 
              species.
