Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The purpose of this project is to clarify the nature and dynamics              
              of international cooperation in exchange rate management among the             
              three major industrialized countries, namely the United States,                
              Japan and Germany.  The currencies of these three countries, the               
              dollar, yen and mark, have been floating against one another since             
              the early 1970s, but the exchange rates among them have been                   
              unstable and saw major misalignments in the early 1980s, leading               
              to a greater concern for the possibility of international                      
              cooperation to stabilize exchange rates and prevent misalignments.             
                                                                                             
              There is some evidence that the three countries have been trying               
              to coordinate their exchange rate policies systematically since the            
              mid-1980s, but except for some journalistic accounts of                        
              coordination, not much is known about how and why cooperation takes            
              place.  This project is the first major attempt to systematically              
              analyze the causal structure of exchange rate cooperation.                     
                                                                                             
              The project covers the entire period of floating exchange rates and            
              uses the data on foreign exchange market intervention published by             
              the Federal Reserve Board and the German Bundesbank and estimated              
              data for Japan.  Other standard economic statistics available from             
              national and international sources and political variables which               
              are relatively easily observable are also used.                                
                                                                                             
              The project is significant in the sense that it is the first                   
              scientific (statistical) attempt to explain exchange rate policy               
              cooperation among the three key countries of enormous economic and             
              political importance.  If successfully executed, it will not only              
              contribute to our understanding of the nature of the current                   
              exchange rate system and exchange rate policies but also contribute            
              to our understanding of international economic cooperation in                  
              general.
