Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              A new approach known as the Source Galerkin method for Quantum                 
              Field Theory will be pursued.  Source Galerkin, unlike current                 
              Monte Carlo based techniques, explicitly uses spacetime and                    
              internal symmetries of a system to pose the problem of solution                
              so as to allow considerable analytic input.  The complexity of                 
              this requires one to use computer algebra to generate the                      
              equations coded for computation on Cray's and CM-2's.  Results                 
              have been sensationally good with many orders of magnitude                     
              improvement in speed and accuracy compared to Monte Carlo.                     
              Source Galerkin has the property that fermions and bosons can be               
              treated (aside from commutation) in a symmetric manner.  It is                 
              not necessary to solve a fermion problem exactly for any given                 
              boson configuration as with Monte Carlo.  Consequently, problems               
              involving dynamical fermions are no harder than those with                     
              bosons.  Problems of physical significance will be analyzed with               
              Source Galerkin methods during this research.  We expect to                    
              examine Hubbard models for high temperature superconductivity                  
              without a "sign problem".  We anticipate obtaining valid                       
              dynamical results in Lattice QCD.  While it is certain that                    
              teraflop technology will still allow only a limited class of                   
              results for conventional QCD, it is possible that these new ideas              
              will allow us to obtain predictive and valid QCD results.
