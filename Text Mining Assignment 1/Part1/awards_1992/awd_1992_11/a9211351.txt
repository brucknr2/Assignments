Abstract    :
              This is a 1992 RIA Award.  The object of this                                  
              proposal is to develop basic understanding of                                  
              ferroelectric thin films and apply them to                                     
              ULSI DRAM memory cells.  Specifically the                                      
              research will investigate the three major                                      
              limitations to developing practical ferroelectric                              
              DRAM memory--namely, electrode materials,                                      
              thickness scaling and thin film reliability.  The                              
              study will:                                                                    
              (a)   identify and experimentally explore                                      
                    alternative electrode materials (e.g.                                    
                    Ru/RuO2 system) which are suitable for                                   
                    the integration of ferroelectric capacitor                               
                    with silicon microelectronics process.                                   
              (b)   investigate and develop various                                          
                    techniques and approaches to the                                         
                    scaling of  ferroelectric film thickness                                 
                    (to << 2000A) while satisfying all the                                   
                    challenging requirements of ULSI                                         
                    DRAM dielectrics.                                                        
              (c)   develop better basic understanding and                                   
                    models of device degradation                                             
                    mechanisms  (e.g. fatigue, aging and                                     
                    time-dependent dielectric breakdown),                                    
                    and techniques for improving thin film                                   
                    reliability.                                                             
                                                                                             
              The results of the study should have                                           
              significant impact in successfully integrating                                 
              ferroelectric thin films with silicon processing.
