Abstract    :
              In developing countries, the provision of disaster relief is                   
              among the most visible and costly functions performed by                       
              governments to promote social welfare.  In China, for example,                 
              disaster relief accounted for 70 to 80% of social welfare                      
              expenditures between 1983 and 1987.  Disaster relief is also a                 
              large budget item in industrialized countries like the United                  
              States.  The U.S. government regularly pays substantial sums for               
              relief and a large share of humanitarian aid to other countries                
              is given in the wake of disasters.  The United Nations noted the               
              importance of relief and the debates about how to provide it when              
              it designated the 1990's as the International Decade of Disaster               
              Relief.                                                                        
                                                                                             
              The study has three objectives.  The first is to set out the                   
              basic economic principles of disaster relief programs.  A                      
              theoretical analysis will clarify tradeoffs between welfare and                
              efficiency in the provision of aid.  A central argument is that                
              the economic effects of disaster relief differ substantially in                
              economies with well-developed insurance markets like the U.S. and              
              these without, like China or India.  The second aim is to apply                
              the theoretical insights and analyze the disaster relief system                
              in China.  It is estimated that the cumulative loss from                       
              disasters amount to 3-4% of GNP each year, and disaster relief                 
              has become an especially important part of the social safety net               
              since de-collectivization.  The effect of environmental changes                
              on the frequency and scale of disasters is also investigated in                
              terms of increased costs, the ability to target the most needy                 
              recipients, and institutional weaknesses in China.  The third aim              
              of the study builds on the first two and involves extending the                
              collection of a household level data set initiated in the                      
              Shandong Province of China.  The data set will allow the                       
              application of new econometric techniques to test hypotheses                   
              about the extent of consumption smoothing and risk taking in face              
              of possible disasters.
