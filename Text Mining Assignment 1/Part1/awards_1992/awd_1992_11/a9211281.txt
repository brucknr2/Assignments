Abstract    :
              The purpose of the research to be performed on this RIA award is               
              to develop a thorough understanding of the mechanism of chemical               
              segregation of multicomponent, noble metal-bearing metallic                    
              precursors that occurs during the recently developed "cyclic                   
              oxidation" process used for the preparation of superconducting                 
              oxide/noble metal composites.  Combined use of the oscillating                 
              oxidation process and oxide melt processing should yield                       
              fracture-tough superconducting composites with high transport                  
              critical current density in significant magnetic fields.
