Abstract    :
              The goal of the proposed research is to use system                             
              identification methods to develop algorithms to                                
              estimate wind velocity profiles along the path of a                            
              laser distortion data measured at a receiver.  The                             
              receiver will either be a photodetector array or                               
              wavefront sensor.  A dynamic system model for the                              
              index of refraction, in which the wind profile                                 
              appears as a parameter is presented.  Maximum                                  
              likelihood methods will be used for estimation of                              
              the wind profile.  Both existing estimation                                    
              algorithms, based on  the Kalman filter, and the                               
              development of new computationally efficient                                   
              algorithms are proposed for the identification of                              
              the resulting infinite dimensional stochastic system.                          
              The proposed research will contribute to remote                                
              sensing by introducing the use of both aerodynamic                             
              models and system identification methods into the                              
              problem of wind profile measurement.  The develop                              
              of computationally efficient algorithms represents                             
              an important contribution to the identification of                             
              infinite dimensional stochastic systems.
