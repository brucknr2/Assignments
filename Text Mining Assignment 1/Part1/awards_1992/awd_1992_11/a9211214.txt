Abstract    :
              It is well established that bone is remodeled in response to                   
              loading patterns.  The two most influential loads for limb bones               
              are those incurred during locomotion and those due to body size.               
              Whereas the impact of body size (weight) on limb bone morphology               
              has been studied in a variety of animals, few studies have paired              
              an analysis of forces generated during locomotion (kinetics) with              
              an examination of bone structures associated with strength and                 
              rigidity under loading (structural mechanics).  This study will                
              analyze the kinetics of locomotion in rodents (guinea pigs,                    
              chinchillas, agoutis, pacas, and Patagonian hares), representing               
              slow to fast running species and small (under 2 lbs.) to large (20             
              lbs.) body sizes.  The animals will be allowed to run freely in an             
              enclosure fitted with a force plate that will record the forces                
              generated by the limbs during locomotion.  Forelimb and hind limb              
              forces and impulses in all five species will be tested for                     
              differences as a result of locomotor pattern, locomotor speed, and             
              body size.  The principal investigator has already completed a                 
              study of buttressing patterns in the long bone shafts of these                 
              rodents and will accordingly match kinetic data with structual                 
              data.  The most significant consequence of the study, therefore,               
              will be in forming a bridge between kinetic performance and                    
              observed anatomy which can then be used to understand the                      
              structural adaptations of any bone, including human.
