Abstract    :
              This research group proposes to develop, distribute and                        
              support computer-based instrumentation for the bioacoustics                    
              research community.  This includes further development of                      
              CANARY (the software package produced during the previous                      
              funding period), analog to digital acquisition hardware, and                   
              digital signal processing hardware designed and produced at                    
              Cornell.  These components will be integrated into a fully                     
              functional, user-friendly bioacoustics signal analysis                         
              workstation on a Macintosh computer.  This system provides a                   
              powerful environment for advanced research in bioacoustics                     
              conducted by an active, interdisciplinary group of                             
              scientists with a broad spectrum of expertise in animal                        
              communication, human speech, and signal processing, with                       
              particular emphasis on vocal communication and perception.
