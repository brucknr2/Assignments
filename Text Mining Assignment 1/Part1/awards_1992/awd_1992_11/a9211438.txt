Abstract    :
                   The investigator is developing a calculus of stochastic                   
              partial differential equations (SPDEs) for the distribution of                 
              particles and vortices.  These SPDEs are partial differential                  
              equations (PDEs) of parabolic type which are corrected by an                   
              additional fluctuation term.  The fluctuation term has to be                   
              derived from the particle distribution.  One of the advantages of              
              this approach is that all quantities in the SPDE can be                        
              interpreted in physical terms, and conservation laws will hold                 
              for the SPDE if they hold for the underlying physical model.                   
                   The investigator is developing a method of studying                       
              stochastic systems which arise in theoretical physics, fluid                   
              dynamics, chemistry and various fields of mathematics.  The                    
              quantities in the models can be interpreted in physical terms,                 
              which should help in the analysis.
