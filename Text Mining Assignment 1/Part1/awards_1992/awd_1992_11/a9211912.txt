Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              A new design for real-time low light fluorescence video microscopy             
              for capturing kinetic images of up to 4 dyes contained in the same             
              living cell will be constructed and tested.  It will be used to                
              determine intracellular calcium and pH and show how the                        
              measurements may be used to correct the intracellular calcium                  
              values.  The dissociation values (Kd's) for the fluorescent probes             
              of Calcium are strongly pH dependent and failure to correct the Kd             
              for the prevailing pH can greatly bias the apparent calcium                    
              concentration, especially in acidic conditions.  The method will be            
              used to investigate the rapid kinetics of intracellular calcium and            
              pH in cultured pituitary intermediate lobe melanotropes and to                 
              their relationship to hormone release.  These cells respond to                 
              potassium ion induced depolarization by entry of calcium into the              
              cell with a simultaneous acidification of the cell.  The hypothesis            
              will be tested that the rapid acidification is caused by the influx            
              of calcium and is not its antecedent.  The second hypothesis to be             
              tested is that the hormone, dopamine, through its specific                     
              receptors (D2) regulated melantrope calcium and pH.
