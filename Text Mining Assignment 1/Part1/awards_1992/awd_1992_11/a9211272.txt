Abstract    :
              Developing efficient storage management methods for objects of                 
              varying sizes and lifetimes is the mission of this project.                    
              Means such as compile-time techniques for objects with short                   
              lives, tunable generation scavenging for objects with medium                   
              lifetimes, and methods for long-lived non-persistent objects                   
              will be applied to garbage collection.  In addition, some                      
              novel approaches for managing persistent objects (those that                   
              remain between program executions) shall be explored.  It is                   
              hoped that these techniques will also apply to concurrent                      
              processing.  A prototype toolkit for language implementors                     
              will be developed.
