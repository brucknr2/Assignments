Abstract    :
              The objective of this research, jointly funded by the Divisions of             
              Materials Research and Mathematical Sciences, is to develop                    
              reliable theoretical methods for calculating the patterns that                 
              result in crystal growth subsequent to morphological instability               
              and to discover and quantify their unifying aspects.  Morphological            
              instability pertains to spontaneous changes in shape of some                   
              material body under the influence of driving forces such as                    
              capillarity, diffusion, and heat flow.  Examples include cellular              
              morphologies in semiconductor crystals, dendritic solidification of            
              metallic alloys, and shape changes of phases in composite                      
              materials.  Research methods include numerical solution of free                
              boundary problems and phase field equations via supercomputing and             
              computer simulation using random walk algorithms.

              The accurate modeling and physical understanding of patterns which             
              form during the growth of crystals is an extremely difficult                   
              problem.  However, the growth of solid bodies from the melt is                 
              common to most fields of materials science.  Thus, any progress                
              made in this field can have broad ramifications.  The work is also             
              highly interdisciplinary and requires research at the boundaries of            
              materials science, condensed matter physics and applied                        
              mathematics.  Consequently, this research in nonlinear science is              
              jointly funded through the Materials Research and Mathematical                 
              Sciences Divisions.
