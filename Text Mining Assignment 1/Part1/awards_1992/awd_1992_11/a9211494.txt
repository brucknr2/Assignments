Abstract    :
              The recent explosive growth in parallel and distributed                        
              systems has brought new importance to the field of scheduling                  
              theory.  In order for this technology to fulfill its potential                 
              of providing tremendous computing power, it is crucial to                      
              understand how to best schedule the components of a                            
              computation on the resources of the parallel or distributed                    
              system, so that the most efficient use possible of these                       
              resources is achieved.  In this research algorithms will be                    
              designed for the basic problems of scheduling a set of                         
              machines.  Although this work is motivated by the application                  
              of these problems to parallel and distributed computing, many                  
              of the problems are of great importance in operations research                 
              as well.                                                                       
                                                                                             
              The focus is on two fundamental models of scheduling more than                 
              one machine:  the shop model, in which each job has a number                   
              of operations, each of which must be processed by a particular                 
              machine, and the parallel machine model, in which each job has                 
              one operation which can be processed by any of the machines.                   
              Most of these problems are NP-hard, and much remains to be                     
              understood about how well they can be approximated in                          
              polynomial time.                                                               
                                                                                             
              Further, work will be done on scheduling models that more                      
              completely capture realistic parallel and distributed                          
              scheduling questions.  Traditional models have largely ignored                 
              any underlying parallel and distributed network; they have                     
              also most often assumed that the entire specification of a                     
              problem is given in advance of the beginning of the                            
              construction of a schedule.  Problems of scheduling and load                   
              balancing on specific networks and architectures and on-line                   
              algorithms for both the traditional and more realistic                         
              scheduling models will be studied.
