Abstract    :
              Parametric computing deals with problems where the input is a function         
              of one or more parameters.  This research will analyze various questions       
              in parametric combinatorial optimization.  These questions can be              
              described as either search or construction problems.  Search problems          
              involve finding the parameter values for which certain conditions hold.        
              Construction problems deal with determining the set of all the optimum         
              solutions that are obtained when varying the parameters within a               
              prescribed range.                                                              
                                                                                             
              Three specific areas of research are:  Parametric optimum subgraph             
              problems on graphs of bounded treewidth; Efficient combinatorial               
              algorithms for Lagranian relaxation problems; Implementation of                
              construction and search algorithms, especially for problems related to         
              minimum spanning trees.  A common theme is the notion of algorithm             
              simulation, a technique that originated in the field of minimum-ratio          
              optimization.  This work combines this idea with other algorithmic,            
              geometrical, and graph-theoretical tools.
