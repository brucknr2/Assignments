Abstract    :
                   The planned effort is a continuation of the work under NSF                
              Grant DMS 8810150 entitled "Topics in Spectral Methods".  The                  
              principal investigators will continue the theoretical and                      
              computational investigation related to spectral and ENO                        
              (essentially non-oscillatory) methods for discontinuous problems.              
                   The research and educational activities involved in                       
              computational fluid dynamics have wide applicability to                        
              scientific and engineering problems.
