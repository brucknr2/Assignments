Abstract    :
                   The cessation of passive margin sedimentation in Paleozoic                
              time and the beginning of arc magmatism in Mesozoic time in                    
              southern Arizona are clearly established, and the deposits                     
              associated with both Paleozoic sedimentation and Mesozoic volcanism            
              have been or are being studied.  The nature of the transition                  
              itself remains unknown, however, although coherent and plausible               
              models have been provided for a similar time span in the Mojave                
              Desert and elsewhere along the Cordilleran margin.                             
                   This project will investigate epiclastic, volcaniclastic, and             
              volcanic strata associated with the Paleozoic/Mesozoic boundary in             
              southern Arizona.  An integrative geologic investigation will                  
              involve:  1) Detailed field mapping of sections where depositional             
              sequences from Paleozoic to early Mesozoic strata are known or                 
              inferred; 2) Facies analysis of strata along the contact, in order             
              to determine a) the tectonic setting of earliest Mesozoic                      
              magmatism; 3) U-Pb zircon b) the tectonic setting of earliest                  
              Mesozoic magmatism; 3) U-Pb zircon geochronology on volcanic rocks             
              at the contact to establish the initial timing of magmatic                     
              activity, or where appropriate as a tool in correlating sequences.             
              This research will fill an important gap in our understanding of               
              late Paleozoic to early Mesozoic tectonic evolution of the                     
              southwestern Cordillera by shedding light on the timing and style              
              of the transition from passive-margin sedimentation to subduction              
              and magmatism in southern Arizona.
