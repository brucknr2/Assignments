Abstract    :
              The object of this review is to investigate a physical mechanism               
              for destabilization and disintegration of structure of coherent                
              vortices which occur in many practical flows such as the                       
              horseshoe vortices which form at the junction of an appendage on               
              a body in motion, and the coherent streamwise vortices in a                    
              turbulent shear layer.  The vortices in these flows represent a                
              significant drain in energy and have considerable bearing on the               
              fluid forces exerted on the associated body or system; the                     
              vortices induce structural vibrations, contribute to flow noise,               
              generate excess flow drag and in the case of the vortex pair in                
              the wake of a large aircraft present significant hazard during                 
              landing to other aircrafts taking off from busy airports.  A                   
              common feature of these flows is that the vortices persist either              
              in an imposed weak strain or shear, one of the effects of which                
              is to distort the shape of the core structure of the vortices.                 
              Available experimental or numerically simulated results suggest                
              that imposing an external periodic pressure field or flow                      
              perturbation at certain frequencies on these flows has dramatic                
              effects on the coherent vortices, inducing their suppression in                
              some cases.
