Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This project involves three steps into materials science.  The                 
              first step naturally follows from previous ab-initio work on gas               
              phase Van der Waals complexes.  Several large transition metal                 
              complexes will be examined with the extended Huckel method.  This              
              will answer fundamental questions on the size-specificity of                   
              reactions with clusters; it will also aid in our ability to model              
              surfaces by clusters.  Secondly, the binding of thin metal films               
              to ceramics will be examined.  This is of technological                        
              importance and fundamental interest for the understanding of                   
              adhesion between surfaces.  This study will utilize the tight                  
              binding method with the extended Huckel Theory.  The third                     
              activity will be directed at the study of fullerenes.  Since the               
              current software implementation and computer resources are                     
              insufficient to carry out these three projects on parallel                     
              machines new techniques necessary to implement them will be used               
              in collaboration with the Theory Center.
