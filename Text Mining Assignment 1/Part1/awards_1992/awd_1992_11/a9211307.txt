Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Although gonadal hormones act on the brain to influence a variety              
              of processes, it is unclear exactly how these hormones act on the              
              brain to produce their effects.  Recently, induction of the                    
              proto-oncogene c-fos has been used as a tool to identify individual            
              neurons and areas of the brain which are activated by particular               
              physiological stimuli.  The present project proposes to adapt the              
              technique of c-fos immunocytochemistry to examine which nuclei in              
              the brain are activated during exposure to the ovarian hormones                
              estrogen and progesterone and during sexual behavior in the female             
              guinea pig.  In addition, the techniques to double label cells for             
              c-fos and a variety of neuropeptides will be developed so that it              
              can be ascertained whether particular neuropeptides are contained              
              in the cells which are activated by ovarian hormones and sexual                
              behavior.  This will give us further insights into exactly how and             
              where these gonadal hormones may be exerting their effects and will            
              provide the preliminary data to form the basis of a grant proposal             
              which will examine whether the noradrenergic system and ovarian                
              hormones interact at a particular subset of neurons to exert their             
              facilitatory actions on female lordosis behavior.
