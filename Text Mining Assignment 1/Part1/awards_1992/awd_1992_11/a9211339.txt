Abstract    :
              Research in theoretical condensed matter physics will be performed             
              using both large scale numerical simulations and analytical                    
              techniques to study the properties of homogeneous, inhomogeneous               
              and artificially fabricated superconducting systems.  This work is             
              motivated by experimental discoveries and will, in turn, lead to               
              predictions which can be tested by experiment.  The problems to be             
              studied include quantum fluctuation induced transitions; metastable            
              magnetic properties; and, real time vortex dynamics, including                 
              self-field effects.  The results obtained from this research will              
              enhance our understanding of the physics of photolithographically              
              fabricated arrays of ultrasmall Josephson junction arrays and of               
              high temperature superconductors.                                              
              %%%                                                                            
              Research on a variety of problems of current interest in condensed             
              matter physics revolving around the properties of very large arrays            
              of ultrasmall Josephson junctions - a type of superconducting                  
              switch - will be undertaken.  These arrays are important in their              
              own right for possible applications to superconducting                         
              microelectronics and are also important for what they can tell us              
              about the basic physics of high temperature superconductors and                
              problems in disordered systems.
