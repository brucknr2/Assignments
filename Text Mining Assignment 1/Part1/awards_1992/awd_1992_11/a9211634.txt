Abstract    :
                   This project aims to develop the probabilistic analysis of                
              several problems of Euclidean combinatorial optimization while                 
              principally focusing on concrete questions involving minimal cost              
              paths, minimum spanning trees, Steiner trees, and minimal cost                 
              matchings.  One critical line of investigation concerns the                    
              possibility of a central limit theorem for subadditive Euclidean               
              functionals, especially for the length of the minimal spanning                 
              tree of a random sample.  Connections between this problem and                 
              the theory of continuum percolation are strong, and progress in                
              either of these two areas can be expected to have useful impact                
              on the other.  The overall significance of the project comes in                
              part from the fact that probabilistic methods in the theory of                 
              algorithms have already led to a number of well acknowledged                   
              computational breakthroughs, and additionally, from the                        
              observation that computational problems have many sustained                    
              interactions with topics that are central to probability theory,               
              like the theory of martingale inequalities, Gaussian processes,                
              and empirical processes.                                                       
                   This project aims to develop the applications of                          
              probabilistic methods to problems that are of concern to computer              
              scientists, operations researchers, and others who engage                      
              questions of optimization of discrete systems.  The particular                 
              feature of the problems of main interest to the proposal is that               
              of a close connection between geometry, optimization, and natural              
              probability models for random sets of points in Euclidean space.
