Abstract    :
              The objectives of this research are                                            
              to build a instrumented chair to                                               
              study seated posture stability and                                             
              to use the measurements obtained                                               
              from the chair to formulate and                                                
              validate a model of seated posture                                             
              control.  This research is                                                     
              important since all previous                                                   
              studies have concentrated on the                                               
              control and modelling of standing                                              
              posture and gait.  In some                                                     
              situations, such as for children                                               
              with neuromuscular disorders, the                                              
              control of seated posture is very                                              
              important.  These studies could                                                
              suggest strategies for surgical,                                               
              therapeutic and other interventions                                            
              to help stabilize patients in the                                              
              seated position.
