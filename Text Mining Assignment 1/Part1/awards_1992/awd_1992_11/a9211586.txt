Abstract    :
              The photochemical and photophysical consequences of attaching                  
              reactive chromophores to the hydrohpobic tail of amphiphilic                   
              molecules will be investigated. The thrust of the program will                 
              be to define the structural features of the microheterogeneous                 
              systems which dictate the resultant reaction processes. The                    
              reactive groups to be investigated include styryl and stilbene                 
              moieties. Bifunctional phospholipids will be utilized in order                 
              to provide molecular species which have spatially exact                        
              geometries. These geometries place reactive functional groups                  
              in favorable positions for reactions such as cycloadditions.                   
              Interactions between reactive groups such as stilbenes,                        
              styrenes, and polyenes will be studied in dilute, mixed, and                   
              pure dispersions in an attempt to separate intermolecular and                  
              intramolecular processes.

              This grant from the Organic Dynamics Program supports the                      
              continuing work of Professor David Whitten at the University of                
              Rochester. The studies will be directed to establishing a                      
              better understanding of the factors which control chemical                     
              reactions in heterogeneous systems. The systems to be                          
              investigated are unique molecules which have both hydrophilic                  
              (attracted to water) and hydrophobic (repelled by water)                       
              properties. By incorporating reactive chemical groups that are                 
              responsive to light as an integral part of these molecules, it                 
              is possible to produce a variety of reactions which might                      
              otherwise fail to occur. Implications for the medical and                      
              materials areas of science are numerous.
