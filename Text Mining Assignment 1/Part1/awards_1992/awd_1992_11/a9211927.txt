Abstract    :
              A field site in a debris flow                                                  
              source area will be instrumented                                               
              with tensiometers and rainfall

              being collected by a remote, real-                                             
              time data logger configured to                                                 
              record a highly transient reponse.                                             
              A saturated-unsaturated flow model                                             
              will be calibrated and later used                                              
              to measure effective stresses

              hydraulic conductivity of the soil.                                            
              The effective stress response,                                                 
              together with strength data, the

              strain behavior of the soil, will                                              
              be used to develop a model for
