Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This investigation will track participation in the nomination and              
              general elections of 1992 in order to study the relationship                   
              between involvement in presidential nomination campaigns and                   
              participation in the general election.  The researchers are                    
              concerned with participation in the fall presidential campaign, in             
              campaigns for other offices, and in the party organizations.  In               
              addition, they will focus upon identifying and tracking patterns               
              of change in the party system.  They contend that presidential                 
              nominations are important avenues for recruiting activists into                
              campaign and party activity.  This is an underappreciated                      
              consequence of contemporary nomination campaigns, and it is one                
              that this investigation is uniquely designed to address.                       
                                                                                             
              As a renewal investigation, the researchers will continue the long-            
              term tracking of presidential nomination participants they began               
              with in the 1980 election.  They recontact their panel of state                
              convention delegates, which reaches back to the 1980 nomination                
              campaign.  The researchers also continue their 5-wave panel of                 
              caucus attenders begun in 1984, and recontact the bulk of their                
              1988 cross-section samples from the 1988 campaign.  In addition,               
              the researchers draw new cross-sections of caucus attenders from               
              the 1992 nomination campaign.  All samples involve both Democrats              
              and Republicans, and all of their contacts in this phase of the                
              study will be made immediately following the 1992 fall election.               
                                                                                             
              This study promises to substantially enhance our understanding of              
              the role that nomination campaigns play in recruiting activists                
              into campaign and political party activity.
