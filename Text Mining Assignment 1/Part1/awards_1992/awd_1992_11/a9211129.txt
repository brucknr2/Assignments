Abstract    :
                   This award is to support a postdoctoral associate to work in              
              experimental computer science.  The associate, Kathleen Cummings,              
              will be working with Professor Mark Clements on digital signal                 
              processing related to human speech.                                            
                                                                                             
                   The goal of the research is to develop a three dimensional                
              model of speech production using finite difference modeling to                 
              simulate acoustic wave propagation in the vocal tract.  The model              
              is complex enough to require the use of high performance                       
              computing resources.  Initially a two dimensional model will be                
              developed and elaborated.  In the second year a three dimensional              
              will be developed and tested.  Techniques from finite difference               
              methods from electromagnetics and computational fluid dynamics                 
              will be utilized.
