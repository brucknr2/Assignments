Abstract    :
                   This award is to support a postdoctoral associate to work in              
              experimental computer science.  The associate, Terrence Finnegan,              
              will be working with Professor Orville Vernon Burton in                        
              developing user interfaces to very large databases requiring both              
              database access and statistical analyses.  The user of the system              
              is assumed to be a scholar unfamiliar with the use of high                     
              performance computers.                                                         
                                                                                             
                   The specific application will be the census database.  In                 
              addition to developing the user interface, the research will also              
              incorporate the information into a Geographic Information System.              
              Visualization tools will also be developed that are appropriate                
              for the use by history scholars.  The development platforms will               
              be computers owned by the National Center for Supercomputer                    
              Applications at the University of Illinois.
