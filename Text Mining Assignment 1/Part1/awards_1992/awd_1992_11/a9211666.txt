Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This proposal studies salt induce protein precipitation;                       
              specifically the impact of micromixing and contacting geometry                 
              on protein solubility, and the relation between contacting                     
              conditions and precipitate morphology.  The work will be used                  
              to connect microscopic and macroscopic description of protein                  
              aggregation and precipitation in an effort to move protein                     
              precipitation to an engineering basis.
