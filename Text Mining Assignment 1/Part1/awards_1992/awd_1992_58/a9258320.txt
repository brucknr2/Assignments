Abstract    :
              This grant from the Organic Dynamics Program supports the work                 
              of Professor James S. Nowick at the University of California                   
              Irvine.  A new strategy will be developed for controlling                      
              peptide secondary structure by linking multiple amino acid                     
              chains to a stiff oligomeric backbone that serves as a                         
              molecular scaffold.  The molecular scaffold will be based upon                 
              an oligourea that will be synthesized in an iterative fashion.                 
              This strategy will be used to create beta-sheets and to develop                
              molecular receptors for small peptides.                                        
              %%%                                                                            
              The three dimensional structure of a peptide will be controlled                
              by linking the peptide chain to a rigid molecular backbone.                    
              The backbone will be designed to hold several peptides in                      
              parallel and antiparallel fashions.  This represents a                         
              fundamentally new approach to the control of protein structure.                
              The design of the backbone is ideally suited for the                           
              development of receptors for small peptides.
