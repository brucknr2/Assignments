Abstract    :
              The P.I. research pertains to the investigation                                
              of the role impurities and inhomogeneities will                                
              play in operation of ballistic electron and                                    
              single-electron devices.  This necessitates the                                
              development of a technique to enable gates to                                  
              be scanned over the surface of a                                               
              semiconductor.
