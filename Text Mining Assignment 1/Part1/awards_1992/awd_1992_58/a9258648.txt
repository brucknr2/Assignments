Abstract    :
              This is an NYI project which is concerned with the engineering                 
              effects of watershed and channel erosion.  Related topics are                  
              calibration of an empirical model for predicting debris volumes,               
              design of engineering structures for mitigating debris flows,                  
              formation of policies to control land development in debris-prone              
              areas.
