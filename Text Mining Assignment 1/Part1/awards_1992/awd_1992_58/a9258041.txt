Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  The goal of this research is to make fundamental measurements             
              of physical, chemical and photochemical heterogeneous processes                
              that could affect the composition of our atmosphere.  Spectroscopic            
              techniques in well-defined vacuum environments to characterize the             
              growth and reactivity of atmospheric aerosols.  Experiments will be            
              performed both on model thin-film samples and on actual particles              
              we fabricate in the laboratory.  Measurements of model particle                
              composition, nucleation and growth rates, heterogeneous chemical               
              and photochemical reaction rates, and condensed-phase optical                  
              properties will be carried out.
