Abstract    :
              Devadas         Research is on logic and behavioral verification of VLSI 
              circuit designs, and application of hardware verification  techniques to
              software verification.  Topics include:  1.     Use of Free Binary Decision
              Diagrams (FBDDs) to find useful  Boolean representations of circuits and
              efficient manipulation  methods for them.  Algorithms for combinational and
              sequential,  synthesis, test and verification applications are being 
              developed.  2.     Automatic methods to verify pipelined implementations 
              against unpipelined specifications are being explored.  The  methods ensure
              that each data transfer that takes place upon the  execution of any instruction
              in the unpipelined circuit also  occurs in the pipelined circuit.  A symbolic
              simulation method is  being developed that will efficiently verify pipelined
              micro-  processors against instruction set specifications.  3.     FBDD
              representations are being used to find symbolic  traversal methods which allow
              for automatic software  verification.  These are also being used to debug
              software  programs by verifying that the program satisfies correctness 
              properties.
