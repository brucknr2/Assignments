Abstract    :
              9258004  Chalmers  Research activities are to be divided into  three areas.  The
              first of these is on:  The  effect of Fluid Dynamic Forces on Cells.  A 
              significant challenge in the large scale  production of products from animal
              and insect  cells is the prevention of cell damage from  hydrodynamic forces. 
              The knowledge generated  by this research activity is to allow for the 
              rational criteria for the design, operation,  and scale-up of bioreactors.  The
              second area  is on:  Bioremediation of Solid Organics.   Initial research in
              this ares involves the  application of chemical and biochemical  engineering
              principals to evaluate processes  for the biodegradation of wastes.  The third 
              area is on:  Magnetically Facilitated Cell  Separations.  The ultimate goal of
              this  research is to develop a continuous,  magnetically-based cell sorter
              (CMCS)  analogous to the fluorescence-based flow  cytometer (FACS).  The basis
              of the CMCS  technique is the ability to label a unique  immunological protein
              on the cell of interest  with an antibody linked to a compound which  is
              paramagnetic.
