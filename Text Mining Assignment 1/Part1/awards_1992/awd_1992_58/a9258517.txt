Abstract    :
                 The proposed research is concerned with language modeling and               
              handwriting.  The goal of the language modeling research is to                 
              represent the computations performed in the comprehension,                     
              production, and acquisition of human languages.  Computations may              
              be described at various levels of abstraction:  as a sequence of               
              state transitions (least abstract), as an algorithm (more                      
              abstract), and as a computational problem (most abstract).  The                
              first step in the proposed research is to characterize the three               
              central computations of human language (comprehension, production,             
              and acquisition) at the highest level of abstraction, as                       
              computational problems.  Each such problem statement is a                      
              computational theory of a portion of language.  The total sum of               
              all such problem statements is a comprehensive computational theory            
              of human language.  The goal of the handwriting recognition                    
              research is to accurately model the human handwriting process. Such            
              a model is, crucial to improving current handwriting recognition               
              technology.  To accomplish this, the statistical constraint                    
              inherent in handwriting, including physical constraints arising                
              from the biomechanics of the pen/hand system, motor-perceptual                 
              constraints arising from the shared desire to communicate                      
              efficiently and reliably, and constraint due to the ad-hoc                     
              convention of handwriting, such as the chosen alphabet and language            
              is explicitly modeled.  //
