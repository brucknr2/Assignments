Abstract    :
              Dr. James A. Cowan has been selected as a National Science                     
              Foundation 1992 Young Investigator.  This five year continuing                 
              award recognizes the research and teaching achievements of new                 
              faculty members.  Cowan is a member of the chemistry department                
              at Ohio State University where he will continue to carry out                   
              research in bioinorganic chemistry, concentrating on                           
              understanding the structural requirements for the interaction                  
              of metals with nucleic acids and enzymes.  His work will focus                 
              on four areas:  (1) the role of the magnesium ion cofactor in                  
              polynucleotide processing enzymes; (2) sequence selective metal                
              binding to nucleic acids; (3) metalloregulatory mechanisms for                 
              DNA-protein interactions; and (4) structural factors of protein                
              binding to high potential iron protein. Folding and sequencing                 
              in proteins imposes specific requirements for association by a                 
              metal, but binding by a metal can also modify the protein's                    
              structure and enhance (or reduce) its enzymatic activity.                      
              Cowan will investigate these specific cases in order to                        
              understand the requirements for and consequences of metal                      
              binding to DNA and certain polynucleotides and enzymes.
