Abstract    :
                   This research, supported by a National Science Foundation                 
              Young Investigator award, will develop numerical algorithms for                
              moving boundary problems in crystal growth, construct fast                     
              algorithms for parabolic systems and geometric problems, and                   
              study dispersive limits and lattice models.                                    
                   The National Science Foundation Young Investigator award                  
              recognizes outstanding young faculty.  This award recognizes the               
              recipient's strong potential for continued professional growth as              
              a research mathematician and for significant development as a                  
              teacher and academic leader.
