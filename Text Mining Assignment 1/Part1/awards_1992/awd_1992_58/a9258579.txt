Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              A novel electronic phenomenon of commensurability resonances in                
              quasi-one dimensional metals will be experimentally investigated.              
              Low temperature, high magnetic field, high angular precision                   
              torque, magnetoresistance, and magnetothermal anisotropy studies               
              will be undertaken, aimed at understanding the nature of this new              
              effect.
