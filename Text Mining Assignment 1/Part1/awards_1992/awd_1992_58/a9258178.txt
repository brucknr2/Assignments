Abstract    :
              This National Science Foundation Young Investigator project is in              
              the general area of analytical and surface chemistry and in the                
              subfield of mass spectrometry.  During the five-year tenure of                 
              this award, Professor Williams and his students will pursue the                
              development of novel instrumental and computational techniques in              
              mass spectrometry, chromatography, and laser spectroscopy for                  
              probing structure and function of large biomolecules; applications             
              of new dissociation methods for ionization in tandem mass                      
              spectrometry; and novel sample introduction techniques for                     
              interfacing liquid chromatographic methods with mass spectrometry.             
              %%%                                                                            
              The successful attainment of the goals of this project should                  
              enable the broad advancement of analytical mass spectrometry,                  
              especially as applied to the characterization of large                         
              biomolecules, and give rise to substantive improvements in hybrid              
              mass spectrometric/liquid chromatographic methods.  Additionally,              
              this NSF Young Investigator Award should significantly assist                  
              Professor Williams in his establishing a vital and productive                  
              program of research and research training.
