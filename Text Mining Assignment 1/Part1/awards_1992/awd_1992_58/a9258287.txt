Abstract    :
              With this National Science Foundation Young Investigator (NYI                  
              award, the Synthetic Organic Program of the Chemistry Division                 
              is supporting the research and teaching activities of Dr. Amir                 
              H. Hoveyda of the Department of Chemistry at Boston College.                   
              The focus of Professor Hoveyda's research will be the design                   
              and development of selective chemical transformations which are                
              subject to catalysis by inexpensive and non-toxic transition                   
              metals.  He will also develop effective and general strategies                 
              in asymmetric synthesis.  Dr. Hoveyda's teaching activities                    
              will focus on curriculum development at the undergraduate level                
              in organic chemistry and the establishment of an annual                        
              research symposium with both undergraduate and graduate                        
              students as active participants.
