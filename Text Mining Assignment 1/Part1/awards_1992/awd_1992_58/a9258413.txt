Abstract    :
                   This project will study the fundamental behavior of                       
              manufacturing processes, including the gas-metal-arc welding                   
              process, the production of metal powders using applied magnetic                
              fields, the radiation-induced curing of composite materials and the            
              production of fiber and ply waviness in composites.  The resulting             
              physical understanding will be applied to the sensor-based control             
              of these processes, to improve the consistency and reliability of              
              the processes.                                                                 
                   It is expected that the resulting work will have significant              
              application to improving the quality and productivity of the                   
              manufacturing industry.
