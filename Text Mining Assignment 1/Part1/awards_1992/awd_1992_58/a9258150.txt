Abstract    :
              Initial directions in optical fiber communication                              
              systems research will involve the routing and                                  
              control of data in a high-speed photonic                                       
              network/switch.  Wavelength - and space - division-                            
              multiplexing technologies will be highlighted as well                          
              as novel network control schemes, all using state of                           
              the art optoelectronic devices gained from                                     
              collaborative efforts.  The results will advance the                           
              capabilities of an eventual (inter)national high-                              
              speed optical data infrastructure.
