Abstract    :
                   This project is oriented toward the problem of high density               
              storage of data.  The past few decades have witnessed a rapidly                
              growing demand for efficient data storage systems.  Advances in                
              computer technology have driven the ever increasing need for higher            
              data storage densities and data transfer rates from systems such as            
              magnetic and optical disks, and magnetic tape.  Many of these needs            
              have been met by improvements in read/write heads, media                       
              technology, and advanced actuator and tracking systems.  Improved              
              signal processing and coding techniques have also played an                    
              important role and offer tremendous potential for providing even               
              further improvements in data transfer rates, storage capacity,  and            
              reliability of data storage systems.  This research focusses on                
              providing such improvements through the use of joint error                     
              correction/modulation coding, joint source/modulation coding, and              
              multi-track recording techniques.
