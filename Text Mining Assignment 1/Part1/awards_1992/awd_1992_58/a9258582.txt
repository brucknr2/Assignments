Abstract    :
                   This NYI award will support the research of a promising and               
              accomplished young investigator.  His research will include                    
              studies of string theory and particle-astrophysics.  In string                 
              theory he will study aspects of spacetime duality (in particular,              
              mirror symmetry), topological field theory, thermal and                        
              cosmological string physics.  In particle-astrophysics he will                 
              study aspects of phase transitions, nontopological solitons,                   
              thermal field theory and astrophysical signatures of extensions                
              of the standard model.
