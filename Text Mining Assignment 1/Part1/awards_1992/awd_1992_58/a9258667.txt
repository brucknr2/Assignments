Abstract    :
              The research focus is on investigation of high speed roll                      
              coating systems, and stability analysis of liquid sheets and                   
              jets.  A first objective is to increase the coating speed,                     
              reduce the coating thickness, and facilitate the recycling of                  
              coated paper products.  Secondly, the stability analysis will                  
              be applied to sheets, jets, in combustion of hazardous                         
              liquids, and high-fiber concentration forming of paper and                     
              board.
