Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Disaccharidase activities vary among bird species, determine bird              
              sugar preferences, and have probably influenced the evolution of               
              nectar and fruit-pulp composition. Dr. Martinez del Rio will                   
              investigate the molecular basis of variation in the intestinal                 
              disaccharidases of birds. He will also study the integration of                
              disaccharidase activity with intestinal sugar uptake and digesta               
              retention time to effect digestive performance and feeding. This               
              is an N.S.F. Young Investigator Award.
