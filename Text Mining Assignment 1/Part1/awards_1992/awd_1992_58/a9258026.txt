Abstract    :
                   Material processing and intelligent manufacturing will be                 
              studied in an interdisciplinary format involving process modeling,             
              in-situ product quality monitoring, and real-time process control.             
              The program will initially focus on molded and advanced composite              
              products.  Two fundamental manufacturing science problems will be              
              addressed, which are (1) the majority of manufacturing processes               
              are not completely understood, and (2) product quality is not                  
              monitored and optimally adjusted during fabrication.  Improved                 
              process models for molding and advanced composites will then be                
              employed in real-time environments to direct manufacturing                     
              processes toward optimal product quality in a feedback control                 
              manner.  Doing so will require the development of sensor subsystems            
              for in-situ product quality assessment and knowledge based tools               
              for real-time manufacturing precess adaption.  Methodologies for               
              operations will be developed.  Several sensory transducer                      
              mechanisms will be investigated, with an initial focus on embedded             
              optical and electronic fibers.  Real-time process adaptation will              
              be accomplished through the development of knowledge based tools               
              incorporating neural networks.                                                 
                   A novel component of the effort will be the procurement of                
              neural network training information from process simulation models             
              rather than from actual manufacturing data.  Overall, the                      
              synergistic manufacturing methodology development will decrease                
              both process development time and cost while improving product                 
              quality and process flexibility.
