Abstract    :
                   Computational approaches to generating design topologies                  
              will be investigated.  These approaches will emphasize                         
              grammatical formulations of design problems that model form and                
              function, and techniques to reason from first principles.                      
              Deterministic and stochastic optimization techniques will be used              
              as search mechanisms within the expanding design space.  Designs               
              will be evaluated for quality based on a new economic model of                 
              cost and quality.
