Abstract    :
              The chloroplast genome utilizes regulatory mechanisms at both the              
              transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels. The development of            
              a technique to introduce defined mutations into the Chlamydomonas              
              chloroplast by this laboratory has made it possible to take a                  
              genetic approach to studying the translational control of                      
              chloroplast electron transport genes. Since mRNA stability is one              
              mechanism for regulating gene expression post-transcriptionally,               
              RNA-binding proteins and ribonucleases which can affect such                   
              stability will also be identified and characterized.

              The information resulting from this study of the mechanisms                    
              involved in post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression in              
              the chloroplast will give greater insight into process which                   
              permits life forms to exist on this earth.
