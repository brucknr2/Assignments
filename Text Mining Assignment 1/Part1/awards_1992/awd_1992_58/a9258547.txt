Abstract    :
                   This research, supported by a National Science Foundation                 
              Young Investigator award, will apply methods from combinatorics                
              and convexity to problems in computational algebraic geometry.  A              
              goal is to design new algebraic algorithms for solving sparse                  
              multivariate polynomial equations.  Other projects include the                 
              study of fiber polytopes, intrinsic Grobner basis theory, hard                 
              Lefschetz theorem for toric varieties, generalized hypergeometric              
              functions, and geometric invariant theory.                                     
                   The National Science Foundation Young Investigator award                  
              recognizes outstanding young faculty.  This award recognizes the               
              recipient's strong potential for continued professional growth as              
              a research mathematician and for significant development as a                  
              teacher and academic leader.
