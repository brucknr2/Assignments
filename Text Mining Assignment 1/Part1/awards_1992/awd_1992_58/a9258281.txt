Abstract    :
              In this NSF Young Investigator project in the Physical                         
              Chemistry Program of the Chemistry Division, Philip Anfinrud                   
              will study the dynamics of transient intermediates formed on                   
              time scales between tens of femtoseconds to microseconds during                
              various chemical transformations.  A transient infrared                        
              absorption spectroscopic technique under development will offer                
              broad spectral coverage, from 450 nm to mid-infrared                           
              wavelengths, with better than 10 wavenumber spectral resolution                
              and sub-picosecond time resolution.  These capabilities will be                
              used to investigate the relation between structure and function                
              in ligand binding heme proteins, the dynamics of ligand motion                 
              in heme proteins, the pathway of photoisomerizations, and the                  
              dynamics of charge carrier relaxation in semiconductors.                       
              %%%                                                                            
              The events that constitute chemical change occur on time scales                
              ranging from trillionths to millionths of a second.  An                        
              understanding of the pathways for such transformations requires                
              detailed knowledge of the very short-lived intermediates                       
              involved.  The experiments in this project will aid in                         
              elucidating the structure of these transient intermediate                      
              species as well as the dynamic pathways by which the chemical                  
              transformations take place.  With such knowledge the relation                  
              between structure, dynamics, and function of processes, such as                
              the cooperative binding of oxygen by myoglobin, will be made                   
              clearer, and models for protein dynamics can be put forward and                
              tested.
