Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The major objective of this research program is to understand the              
              molecular mechanisms controlling plant cell morphogenesis.  One                
              research project deals with the molecular genetic analysis of plant            
              root hair development in plants.  The rewardee will be involved in             
              two undergraduate courses and is mentor for several graduate and               
              Post-doctoral students.
