Abstract    :
                   This NYI award will support the research of a promising and               
              accomplished young investigator.  His research will include a                  
              study of relativistic field theory models of hadronic systems at               
              finite density and temperature, using approaches based both on                 
              quantum chromodynamics (QCD) and on quantum hadrodynamics (QHD),               
              which are relativistic field theories with hadronic degrees of                 
              freedom.  A major goal is to develop connections between QCD and               
              the nuclear phenomenology associated with QHD, by applying QCD                 
              sum rule methods.
