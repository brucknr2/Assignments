Abstract    :
                   This research, supported by a National Science Foundation                 
              Young Investigator award, focuses on the development of                        
              degenerate pseudodifferential operators specially adapted for the              
              analysis of degenerate elliptic and parabolic problems in                      
              geometry.  Specific applications include Hodge theory and index                
              theory on noncompact and singular spaces, analysis of minimal                  
              surfaces with singularities, and analysis of the singular Yamabe               
              problem.                                                                       
                   The National Science Foundation Young Investigator award                  
              recognizes outstanding young faculty.  This award recognizes the               
              recipient's strong potential for continued professional growth as              
              a research mathematician and for significant development as a                  
              teacher and academic leader.
