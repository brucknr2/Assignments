Abstract    :
                   This research, supported by a National Science Foundation                 
              Young Investigator award, will pursue physically motivated                     
              extremal eigenvalue problems, with the applications ranging from               
              mathematical modeling to numerical computation.  The research                  
              will involve the application and development of tools of weak                  
              convergence and geometric function theory.  It will also involve               
              methods of nonsmooth analysis in order to characterize and                     
              compute the extremizers.                                                       
                   The National Science Foundation Young Investigator award                  
              recognizes outstanding young faculty.  This award recognizes the               
              recipient's strong potential for continued professional growth as              
              a research mathematician and for significant development as a                  
              teacher and academic leader.
