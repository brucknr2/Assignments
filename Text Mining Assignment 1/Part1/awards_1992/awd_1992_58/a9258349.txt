Abstract    :
                The primary thrust of this research is the development of processor          
              architectures which will be suitable building blocks for general               
              purpose parallel computers and the transfer of these architectural             
              technologies to industry.  A second thrust is the investigation of             
              highly specialized architectures to address computationally                    
              intractable problems and the setting of the architectural framework            
              for the atomic level technologies of the next century.
