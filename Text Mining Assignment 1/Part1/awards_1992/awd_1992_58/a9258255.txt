Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The PI's research program will explore acoustic imaging by sonar               
              in echolocating bats, animals that rely on acoustic information for            
              spatial perception.  The focus of my work will be on the bat's                 
              perception of sonar targets with complex and changing spatial                  
              structure, such as fluttering insect prey.  Although the research              
              emphasizes auditory information processing in bats, the results                
              will have broad implications for understanding general principles              
              of sensory information processing and perception in a variety of               
              animals.
