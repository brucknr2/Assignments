Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Funds are provided for NYI award to Emily Klein of Duke University             
              whose research projects range from global correlation of ocean-                
              ridge basalt chemistry with crustal thickness and bathymetry,                  
              identification of mantle convection cell boundaries (e.g.,                     
              Australian-Antarctic Discordance) using isotopes to chile ridge                
              subduction and its bearing on melt focussing problem at MORs. Her              
              research  projects are all n general geared toward a unifying theme            
              of understanding mantle melting processes and the creation of the              
              oceanic lithosphere. Klein has received several awards and serves              
              on the editorial board of a journal. She has been teaching both                
              basic and advanced Undergraduate and Graduate courses in Geology               
              and Geochemistry at Duke University for the past three years. Klein            
              has also received a Lilly Foundation award to develop a new                    
              advanced level undergraduate course in Geology. Klein has several              
              collaborative  projects and intends to develop   analytical                    
              techniques for routine analysis of Pb in basaltic rocks.
