Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              A multidisciplinary program of synthesis, processing and                       
              characterization of new quantum-confined semiconductor quantum dot             
              materials is underway.  This program establishes a novel, non-                 
              equilibrium path for the preparation of size selected quantum dots             
              of arbitrary composition in a variety of hosts.
