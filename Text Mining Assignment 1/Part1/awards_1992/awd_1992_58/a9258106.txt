Abstract    :
              Under an NYI award the tribological behavior of thin films will be             
              studied with emphasis on the effects of processing, topography of              
              the substrate surface, and relative coating/substrate properties.              
              The possibility of enhancing coating adhesion by engineering the               
              surface topography of the substrate and by closely controlling the             
              coating thickness will be evaluated.  Initial emphasis will be on              
              the diamond-like and cubic boron nitride films deposited on                    
              stainless steel and carbon steel substrates.  At a later stage,                
              attempts will be made to develop low friction films by co-                     
              deposition of a hard coating material with a softer solid lubricant            
              material.
