Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The fundamental properties, materials issues, and applications of              
              superconducting materials at high frequencies will be studied.                 
              High frequency measurements of superconducting electrodynamics and             
              magnetic flux dynamics are key to understanding the fundamental                
              properties of superconductors and testing the emerging theories of             
              cuprate superconductivity.  These measurements also provide a means            
              of materials characterization and are essential for developing new             
              applications of superconductors.
