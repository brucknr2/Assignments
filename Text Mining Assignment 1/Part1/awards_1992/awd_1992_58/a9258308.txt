Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This research focuses on the physics of chemically prepared quantum            
              dots.  Four problems are targeted:  controlling the quantum dot                
              size and size distribution, fabricating arrays of quantum dots,                
              generating samples with quantum dots in a semiconducting host, and             
              understanding the role of the quantum dot-host interface.
