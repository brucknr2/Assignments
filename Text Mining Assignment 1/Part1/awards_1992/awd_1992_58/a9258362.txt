Abstract    :
                 A fundamental concept in database management systems (DBMSs) is             
              that of physical data independence, i.e., the ability to modify the            
              physical database scheme without requiring a rewrite of the                    
              software that implements the DBMS or the application programs that             
              use the data. This concept enables a DBMS to support multiple                  
              applications and at the same time optimize the physical design of              
              each database to provide each application with the highest                     
              performance available. This research focuses on alternative                    
              implementations of database management systems and investigates:               
              (1) physical data independence, (2) tools and techniques that can              
              optimize the physical design of data for a given application, and              
              (3) techniques for dynamic reorganization  of data in the presence             
              of changing patterns of data access. The main objective is to                  
              maximize the performance of a system, and whenever appropriate, to             
              utilize parallelism. Some of this research has been conducted in               
              the context of the relational data model.  This research project               
              concentrates on the object-oriented data model and other current               
              and emerging data models (i.e., a family of logical constructs for             
              representation and manipulation of data).  This research is                    
              expected to significantly enhance the performance of the current               
              and next generation DBMSs.
