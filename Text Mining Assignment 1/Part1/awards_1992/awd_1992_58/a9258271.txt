Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The effects of disorder and electron-electron interactions on the              
              transport properties of electrons sprayed onto solid hydrogen will             
              be studied.  A second area of study is the nature of 2D                        
              superfluidity on novel substrates such as H2 and C60 using an                  
              ultra-high Q torsional oscillator.
