Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This is a study of magnetic properties of uniform ultrafine                    
              particles and their arrays fabricated by micro-electronics                     
              facilities.  The objective is to understand outstanding problems               
              such as, magnetic perpendicular anisotropy, magnetic internal                  
              structures, finite size effects, and macroscopic magnetic                      
              orderings, all are crucial to the potential applications of these              
              novel structures.
