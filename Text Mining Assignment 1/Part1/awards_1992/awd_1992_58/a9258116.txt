Abstract    :
              During the NYI award period, methods for multi-disciplinary                    
              synthesis of actively controlled complex dynamic systems will be               
              developed and applied to design problems in aero-servo-elasticity              
              and intelligent structures. The methodology will be applicable to              
              synthesis of dynamic systems driven by strong interactions with                
              active controls. Smart sensors and actuators will be integrated                
              in the design together with appropriate structure and control                  
              laws. An experimental component will be built and test optimized.              
              The entire multidisciplinary interaction effort should lead to                 
              efficient strategies for synthesis of structures, aerodynamics,                
              instrumentation and control.***  //
