Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                                                                                            
              This research project addresses the design of autonomous agents                
              that are capable of intelligent behavior in dynamic environments               
              with multiple agents.  The focus is on the development of effective            
              techniques for managing computational resources, with particular               
              attention being given to meta-level control strategies, i.e.,                  
              procedures that allocate and monitor the agent's base-level                    
              reasoning resources.  Such procedures trade optimality of                      
              performance for time-efficiency, a trade-off that is essential in              
              dynamic or multiagent environments.  Experimentation is being                  
              conducted, using a simulation system, to determine the relative                
              advantages that result from the deployment of alternative reasoning            
              strategies in various environments.
