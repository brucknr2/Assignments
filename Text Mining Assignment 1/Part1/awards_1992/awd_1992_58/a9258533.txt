Abstract    :
                Two lines of research will be pursued.  The first is to develop a            
              hybrid symbolic-numeric system for solving systems of polynomial               
              equations numerically.  For this, symbolic algorithms for global root          
              separation will be combined with local numerical methods for root              
              refinement.  One task in the project is to determine the feasibility           
              of a hybrid Groebner basis routine which may deal with inputs more             
              general than ordinary polynomials.  The quotient algebra module is             
              noteworthy because it reduces both the computation of resultants (for          
              general algebraic feasibility ) and the computation of trace forms             
              (for real root location).  The other modules build up, layer by layer,         
              the tools necessary to effectively isolate and refine all solutions of         
              a system of polynomial equations.                                              
                The second research direction is to analyze the structure of sparse          
              resultants.  Sparse polynomials arise frequently in important                  
              applications, so computational advances in dealing with them have much         
              practical significance.  It is planned to investigate resultant                
              equations for systems of sparse Laurent polynomials.  There are                
              important relationships between the combinatorics of parameters                
              associated with such systems and the solutions of polynomial                   
              equations.  Any knowledge of such structure feeds back into                    
              computational methods, e.g., limiting a priori the types of systems            
              which may have solutions of various sorts.
