Abstract    :
              An NYI award supports experimental studies and modeling of the                 
              fundamental structure and properties of the type of lubricated                 
              contacts which are found in magnetic recording and micromechanical             
              systems.  They are characterized by the presence of very thin                  
              lubricant films and by the significant influence of capillary                  
              forces on the friction behavior.  The effects of time scale and                
              surface diffusion of lubricant on friction forces will be                      
              investigated as well as the effects of surface topography and                  
              surface reactions on lubricant retention and mobility.  The effect             
              of lubricant properties on the wear of the lubricant film and the              
              substrate will be evaluated also.
