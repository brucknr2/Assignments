Abstract    :
              We propose to further our initial investigations of                            
              carrier dynamics in solid C60 begun at Rice, using                             
              time-resolved optical methods to study both carrier                            
              relaxation and transport mechanisms in this                                    
              material.  Also, we plan to investigate                                        
              semiconductor interface electronic structure and its                           
              effect on bulk carrier dynamics near the surface.
