Abstract    :
                   This research is aimed at computer-aided automation of design             
              and manufacturing processes with particular emphasis on products               
              modeled with parametric sculptured surfaces.  Over the next five               
              years, research will proceed concurrently in two primary thrusts:              
              (1) investigation of novel techniques for conceptual design of                 
              sculptured surface models, and (2) the development of methods to               
              facilitate the manufacturing processes associated with such                    
              products.  The recently developed surface synthesis technique will             
              be expanded by investigating the development of functional design              
              constraints based on objective performance measures such as                    
              aerodynamics, hydrodynamics, or kinematics, as well as on                      
              subjective characteristics such as surface aesthetics.  Research               
              in the second category will focus on automated generation and                  
              verification of numerically controlled (NC) machine programs.                  
              Given a geometric model of the part to be produced and the                     
              kinematic capabilities of a candidate machine tool, techniques                 
              based on spherical geometry will be investigated to determine                  
              workpiece orientations which are optimal with respect to process               
              time and dimensional accuracy.                                                 
                   Sculptured surface models are among the most commonly utilized            
              geometric representations, and their creation, modification and                
              fabrication can incur substantial capital investment.  Thus this               
              research may have a profound effect on product development                     
              efficiency for a wide range of industrial and consumer products.
