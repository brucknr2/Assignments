Abstract    :
                 This is a National Science Foundation Young Investigator Award.             
              The goal of Dr. Caplan's laboratory is to identify the cellular                
              machinery involved in the generation and maintenance of epithelial             
              polarity.  This will be done using the powerful tools of Drosophila            
              genetics.  A screening procedure already developed in the                      
              laboratory, together with P-element mediated mutagenesis, will be              
              used to identify mutants carrying genetic alterations relevant to              
              epithelial polarity.  Genes identified through this process will be            
              cloned and their protein products will be characterized.                       
              %%%                                                                            
              This is a National Science Foundation Young Investigator Award.                
              Dr. Caplan is interested in the fundamental and important question             
              of how epithelial cells "know" how to maintain a distinct "up and              
              down" polarity.  This is a critical question, since the proper                 
              function of epithelial cells is dependent on this polarity (e.g.,              
              pumping of ions from one side of an epithelial cell layer to the               
              other; secretion of hormones, enzymes, or mucous lubricants to the             
              appropriate place; uptake of nutrients from the alimentary canal;              
              etc.).  Until now, cell biologists have addressed the question by              
              direct observation and biochemical manipulation of epithelial                  
              cells.  Dr. Caplan is developing a clever and novel approach to the            
              problem by exploiting the powerful techniques of Drosophila                    
              genetics, which have already proven enormously useful in studies of            
              development.
