Abstract    :
                   This investigator will develop integrated approaches to the               
              determination of evolutionary relationships, the dating of                     
              evolutionary events, and the establishment of quantitative                     
              methods for distinguishing real from artifactual patterns in the               
              fossil record.  Molecular data collected in my laboratory,                     
              computer and mathematical models, and classical paleontological                
              data will be used.  This work will be done at the University of                
              California, Los Angeles.
