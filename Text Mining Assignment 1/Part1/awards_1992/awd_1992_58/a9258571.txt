Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Research underway involves the synthesis of novel materials                    
              utilizing i) near- and supercritical fluid pathways to polymer                 
              synthesis and ii) thiophene-based monomers.  Both of these research            
              programs utilize new polymer synthesis techniques to achieve                   
              precise structural manipulations to tailor performance and                     
              processing characteristics.
