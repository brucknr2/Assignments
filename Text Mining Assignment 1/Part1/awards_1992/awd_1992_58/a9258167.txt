Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Complex phenomena occur at chemically modified electrode surfaces.             
              Mass changes occur due to ion flow and/or reorganization of the                
              surface.  Optical spectra commonly vary with oxidation/reduction.              
              A combined spectroelectrochemical/quartz crystal micro-balance                 
              technique will be developed which will enable simultaneous                     
              measurement of applied potential, charge, the technique will be                
              employed to investigate electrode surface reactivities of                      
              conducting polymers.
