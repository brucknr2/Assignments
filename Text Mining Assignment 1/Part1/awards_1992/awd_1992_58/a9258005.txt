Abstract    :
              The objective of the research is to develop a                                  
              mathematical foundation to gain-scheduling and                                 
              nonlinear control engineering.  While gain-                                    
              scheduling enjoys widespread application, it remains                           
              an ad hoc practice guided by heuristic rule-of-                                
              thumb.  The research will provide further                                      
              understanding of gain scheduling, thereby                                      
              confirming the heuristic guidelines behind gain-                               
              scheduling and giving them precise quantitative                                
              interpretations.  The nonlinear control engineering                            
              research deals with robust stability analysis,                                 
              performance limitations of nonlinear systems, and                              
              nonlinear time-varying controllers for linear                                  
              uncertain systems.
