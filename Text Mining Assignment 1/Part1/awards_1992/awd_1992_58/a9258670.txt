Abstract    :
              Parhi         Research efforts are directed towards the design of  dedicated,
              high-performance digital signal and image processors.   The emphasis is on
              real-time processing, where samples are  processed as they are received from
              the source, as opposed to  being stored in buffers and then processed in batch.
                      Design of algorithm topologies for recursive signal  processing
              algorithms were once considered a major challenge.   Using the relaxed
              look-ahead technique, new concurrent algorithms  and topologies for adaptive
              LMS and lattice filters, cascade and  lattice recursive digital filters, and
              predictive speech and  image coders have been developed.  Design of concurrent 
              topologies for wave digital filters, decision-feedback  equalizers, and
              adaptive differential vector quantizers are being  pursued.         The
              decoding speed in Huffman and arithmetic coders (used  for lossless
              compression) is limited due to the feedback.  For  the Huffman decoder, the
              codeword length multiplicity constraint  is being exploited to design codes
              where multiple bits can be  simultaneously decoded in parallel.  The
              performance of these  decoders is further improved by the use of conditional
              coding.   Novel approaches for design of parallel arithmetic coders are  also
              being pursued.
