Abstract    :
              Sophisticated optoelectronic devices will be                                   
              fabricated by integrating photodetectors and liquid                            
              crystal modulators into VLSI circuits.  These                                  
              devices will be used as optical neuron arrays in self-                         
              aligning optical learning systems that use                                     
              repetitively exposed photorefractive dynamic                                   
              volume holograms to adaptively classify input data                             
              applied to the network.
