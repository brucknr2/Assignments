Abstract    :
              This National Science Foundation Young Investigator project is in              
              the general area of analytical and surface chemistry and in the                
              subfield of surface analysis.  During the tenure of this five-year             
              award, Professor Levis and his students will develop mass                      
              spectroscopic methods for studying complex molecules adsorbed on               
              surfaces and found in this films.  Two primary thrusts are                     
              involved: (1) the use of hyperthermal (1-10 eV) atoms to promote               
              nondissociative desorption of complex adsorbates from surfaces for             
              subsequent mass spectroscopic analysis and (2) investigation of                
              the use of laser vaporization of biological molecules for use in               
              high speed DNA sequencing experiments.                                         
              %%%                                                                            
              The successful attainment of the goals of this project should give             
              rise to new mass spectroscopic techniques for molecular-level                  
              surface characterization, novel approaches to rapid DNA                        
              sequencing, and new approaches to heteroepitaxial deposition of                
              thin-film molecular solids.  Additionally, this NSF Young                      
              Investigator Award should significantly assist Professor Levis in              
              his establishing a vital and productive program of research and                
              research training.
