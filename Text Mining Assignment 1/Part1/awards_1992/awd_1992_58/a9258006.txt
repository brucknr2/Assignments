Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Multimode heat transfer in turbulent flows will be                             
              investigated.  Many widely varying industrial processes -                      
              chemical vapor deposition, drying of textiles and foodstuffs,                  
              solder reflow of surface mount circuit boards, polymer                         
              injection molding, combustion, and countless others - have a                   
              significant dependence of heat transfer by convection,                         
              conduction and radiation.  Employing the spectral method and                   
              focusing on multimode heat transfer problems, more efficient                   
              and accurate numerical schemes will be developed to permit a                   
              much closer correspondence between academic research and                       
              industrial applications in heat and mass transfer.  The                        
              construction of new experiments designed to rigorously test                    
              and validate the numerical predictions, as well as to provide                  
              detailed measurements and insight to the physical processes                    
              that are observed.  Together, the experiments and calculations                 
              will proved much information about the complicated transport                   
              phenomena present in modern technological application.//
