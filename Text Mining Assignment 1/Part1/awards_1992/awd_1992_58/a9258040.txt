Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  The research to be conducted under this award will include                
              laboratory and field investigations of photochemical and dynamical             
              factors that govern the chemical composition of the earth's                    
              atmosphere.  An attempt will be made to gain a mechanistic                     
              understanding of low-temperature processes which determine the                 
              concentration of ozone in the stratosphere and radiation balance in            
              the upper troposphere.
