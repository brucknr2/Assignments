Abstract    :
                   In this research, networking issues arising in communications             
              systems and parallel processing will be studied within a unified               
              framework encompassing several diverse technologies.  The goal is              
              the consolidation of basic networking principles and techniques,               
              and the development of a systematic methodology, leading to a                  
              deeper understanding of the structural and analytical aspects of               
              networking and supporting innovative technologies.  Under the                  
              networking umbrella, several relevant issues are considered,                   
              including process scheduling and resource sharing, coordination and            
              protocol science, structural and analytical modeling and                       
              optimization of discrete event dynamics and asynchronous                       
              algorithmic implementations.  Motivation for this research is drawn            
              from variety of modern technological areas, including high-speed               
              communication networks and service integration, radio networks and             
              personal communications, parallel and distributed computation,                 
              flexible manufacturing systems.  Quite different in several                    
              respects indeed, these technologies share certain key structural               
              features related to networking and parallelism. They also provide              
              the natural applications for this research where there is strong               
              potential for important technological innovations.
