Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This research is aimed at understanding pinning, dissipative                   
              phenomena and magnetic stability in high temperature                           
              superconductors (HTSC's).  This work includes measurement of                   
              hysteretic response, magnetic relaxation and the magnetic                      
              irreversibility line in single crystalline and polycrystalline                 
              HTSC's.  Magnetic properties will be correlated with                           
              microstructural features responsible for pinning.  Magnetic                    
              instabilities (flux jumps) will be explored in large high quality              
              single crystals.
