Abstract    :
              Modeling and analytical studies will be carried out for                        
              turbulent combustion systems.  Included in these studies will                  
              be efforts directed at development of better understanding of                  
              fundamental mixing processes.  This research will be carried                   
              out in two basic stages: (1) An analytical study to shed light                 
              on the dependency of time evolution of chemical composition as                 
              a function of the mixing parameters governing various systems                  
              of interest; (2) A model development and implementation effort                 
              to apply new ideas in turbulent mixing modeling to full scale                  
              combustion systems.  In this activity, the turbulent mixing                    
              and reaction processes will initially be modeled based on                      
              ideas developed in prior formulation of a linear eddy model,                   
              the only current model formulation that allows for distinction                 
              between the effects of molecular diffusion and turbulent                       
              stirring at the smallest turbulent scale of the flow; such a                   
              distinction is required for accurate prediction of the small-                  
              scale mixing which governs turbulent combustion processes.  An                 
              advanced formulation which can be used in industrial                           
              combustion applications will be pursued.  Part of the research                 
              project will be devoted to implementation of such models and                   
              resulting computer codes on massively parallel computing                       
              machines.                                                                      
                                                                                             
              Energy conservation and environmental protection issues                        
              provide a strong impetus for development of cleaner, more                      
              efficient combustion processes.  Since most combustion occurs                  
              in a turbulent environment and it is the turbulent mixing that                 
              governs the overall combustor performance in most cases, it is                 
              very important that turbulent mixing and combustion be treated                 
              in a more comprehensive manner than in the past.  As part of                   
              this program, models will be applied to realistic combustion                   
              chemistries for analysis of energy production and pollutant                    
              formation.
