Abstract    :
                  Eisenberg  9258684    This is the third year base award and the second year
              matching  award of a five year NSF Young Investigator (NYI) grant.  The aim  of
              this project is to develop an empirically and theoretically  motivated
              framework for the design of powerful, expressive software  applications that
              integrate programming languages and direct  manipulation interfaces.  The
              programming environments for these  applications will be designed to be
              learnable, domain-specific (or  "domain-enriched") and interactive.  The
              stategies for combining  language and interface constructs will emphasize
              opportunities for  creative symbiosis.  Sample applications will include those
              for the  domains of physics, mathematics and graphics design.  The long term 
              goals of this project include empowerment of the end users of  applications by
              providing them with the capability for interactive  programming.
