Abstract    :
              This award provides support to Dr. Jean-Laurent Rosenthal under                
              the National Science Foundation's Young Investigator Awards                    
              program.  The objectives of this program are to recognize                      
              outstanding young faculty in science and engineering, to enhance               
              the academic career of recent Ph.D. recipients, and to foster                  
              contact and cooperation between academia and industry.  Dr.                    
              Rosenthal has already made significant research contributions in               
              the field of economic history, and he has the potential to become              
              a leader in academic research and education.                                   
                                                                                             
              This award allow him to pursue his research interests in the area              
              of credit markets.  Dr. Rosenthal intends to analyze credit                    
              markets in France for the period 1675 to 1860.  A major component              
              of this research will involve the extensive collection of data                 
              from various French archives.  These data will consist of                      
              individual credit transactions and will be linked to other                     
              sources of information about borrowers and lenders.  The research              
              agenda is important because it will shed new light on the                      
              relationship between the evolution of credit markets and economic              
              growth and development.  The research findings could have                      
              important implications for the establishing credit markets in the              
              transition economies of Eastern Europe.
