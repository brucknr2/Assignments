Abstract    :
              Protein kinase C transduces signals that promote phospholipid                  
              hydrolysis.  Binding of a wide variety of signals to cell                      
              surface receptors results in phospholipase C-catalyzed                         
              hydrolysis of phosphatidylinositol bisphosphate, producing the                 
              water soluble head-group, inositol trisphosphate, and the lipid                
              backbone, diacylglycerol.  Both molecules are critical second                  
              messengers in the protein kinase C signalling pathway.                         
              Inositol trisphosphate mobilizes intracellular Ca2+ thus causing               
              protein kinase C, which is present in the cytosol under resting                
              conditions, to bind to the plasma membrane.  Diacylglycerol                    
              activates the kinase; activity also requires the amino                         
              phospholipid, phosphatidylserine.  The long-term objective of                  
              the proposed research is to understand the mechanism of action                 
              of protein kinase C.  Specifically, the role of diayclglycerol                 
              in regulating the enzyme will be addressed.  The hypotheses                    
              that 1! diacylglycerol targets protein kinase C to the plasma                  
              membrane, and 2! diacylglycerol is an allosteric activator of                  
              the kinase will be tested.                                                     
              %%%                                                                            
              The effect of diacylglycaerol on the protein kinase C membrane                 
              interaction, and on the conformation of protein kinase C, will                 
              be addressed with the aim of understanding how this second                     
              messenger regulates the structure and function of protein                      
              kinase C, and in turn, signal transduction.
