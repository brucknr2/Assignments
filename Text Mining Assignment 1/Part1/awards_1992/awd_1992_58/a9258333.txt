Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This National Science Foundation Young Investigator Award will                 
              support the development of state-of-the-art mid-infrared                       
              instrumentation for use with the new generation of large ground-               
              based telescopes.  The principal investigator, Dr. Rognvald Garden,            
              will use this instrumentation to study protoplanetary systems and              
              the winds generated by young stars.
