Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  Goals of the proposed research are two-fold:  1) Describe                 
              the auditory representation of speech using perceptual measures                
              with humans and computational models based upon                                
              neurophysiological data; 2) Model the formation of phonetic                    
              categories from that representation through experiments with                   
              nonhuman animal subjects, and computer simulations with self-                  
              organizing connectionist models.
