Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Transition metal complexes are applied as stereospecific catalysts             
              for the synthesis of a new class of chiral polymers of well-defined            
              architecture.  Functionalized olefins will be investigated to yield            
              an entirely new class of functionalized, chiral macromolecules.                
              Silicon monomers will be investigated to prepare novel                         
              electroactive polymers.
