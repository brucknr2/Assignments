Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The objective of the proposed research is to experimentally observe            
              the inhomogeneous flow processes operative during superplastic                 
              deformation and to study their relationship to the macroscopic                 
              constitutive response through finite element modeling of the                   
              microstructure.  Emphasis will be placed on experimentally                     
              isolating the operative dislocation and diffusional flow processes             
              and the detecting the inhomogeneity of deformation within single               
              grains as well as within larger collections of grains.
