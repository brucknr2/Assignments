Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This research will develop mechanistic models to describe how                  
              inorganic matrix composites will behave in high temperature                    
              environments.  Three specific areas are under study:  effect of                
              temperature change and mismatch in coefficients of thermal                     
              expansion on composite creep, deformation mechanisms in composite              
              materials and composite processing.
