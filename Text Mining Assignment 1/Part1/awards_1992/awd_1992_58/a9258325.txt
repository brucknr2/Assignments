Abstract    :
                   This NYI award will support the research of a promising and               
              accomplished young investigator.  His research will include a                  
              development of the AMANDA neutrino telescope which utilizes the                
              vast expanse of optically transparent ice located one kilometer                
              beneath the surface of the South Pole, and continue to                         
              investigate methods to augment the capabilities of the SPASE air               
              shower array to observe astrophysical sources of high energy.
