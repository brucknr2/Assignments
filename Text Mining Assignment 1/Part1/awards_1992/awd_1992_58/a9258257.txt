Abstract    :
              The aspartate receptor will be used as a model system for                      
              transmembrane signaling.  It will be investigated using solid state            
              nuclear magnetic resonance techniques and mutant receptor proteins             
              to determine critical distances and geometric relationships in the             
              combining site and accessibility of solvent and ligands to the                 
              combining site.  Clustering of the receptor protein will also be               
              studied.  The results should yield a visualization at the molecular            
              level of the receptor binding site and the role of receptor                    
              clustering and conformational changes in the receptor binding                  
              process.                                                                       
              %%%                                                                            
                 Signal transduction is essential to biological organisms or                 
              organelles for the sensing of the environment, reacting to it if               
              necessary and in intercellular communication.  This research will              
              focus on understanding how membrane receptors transmit information             
              across cell membranes.  The goal is to determine how structures of             
              specific regions or active sites of the receptor molecules in the              
              membrane change during the signaling process.  Both the biophysical            
              approaches used in this study and the insight gained into the                  
              molecular mechanisms of signaling should be generally  useful for              
              understanding more complex membrane receptors.
