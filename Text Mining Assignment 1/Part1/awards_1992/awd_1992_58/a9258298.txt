Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The research activities includes:  the design, synthesis, and study            
              of molecular and polymeric liquid crystals with useful electrical              
              and/or magnetic properties; investigations of supermolecular                   
              organizations to create new organic metals, magnetic materials,                
              nonlinear optical materials, and ferroelectric liquid crystals; and            
              new conducting polymers with novel electronic structures and with              
              chemically sensitive conductivities.
