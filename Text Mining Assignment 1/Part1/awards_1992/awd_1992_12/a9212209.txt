Abstract    :
                   This work in theoretical nuclear physics will study the                   
              properties of hadrons in hot dense matter as it is expected to                 
              occur in high energy heavy-ion collisions.  The properties of                  
              mesons in matter will be studied using density dependent                       
              masses and coupling constants.  The relativistic transport                     
              theory will also be generalized to include the density                         
              dependence of other hadrons.  The long range goal of this work                 
              is to understand the dynamics of relativistic heavy-ion                        
              collisions such as will be produced in the future RHIC                         
              facility in search of the quark-gluon plasma.
