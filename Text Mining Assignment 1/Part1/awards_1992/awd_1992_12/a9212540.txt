Abstract    :
                   Research in theoretical elementary particle physics will                  
              utilize an approximation in which the space-time continuum is                  
              replaced by a discrete lattice of points.  The primary purpose                 
              of the work will be to gain a quantitative understanding of                    
              why quarks cannot exist as free particles.  No free quarks                     
              have ever been seen, so it is important to understand how the                  
              strong nuclear force results in their complete confinement                     
              within the particles which have been seen, such as the                         
              nucleons.
