Abstract    :
              Workstations will be purchased to enhance the acquisition, real                
              time treatment and post-processing of large amount of                          
              experimental data obtained from moire and coherent gradient                    
              sensing interferograms, and STM pictures.  High graphic                        
              capabilities, good computer power and large memory space are                   
              needed for better resolution and to handle the quantity of                     
              information.
