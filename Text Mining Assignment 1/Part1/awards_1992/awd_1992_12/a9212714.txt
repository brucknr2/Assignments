Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  The Main objective of this project is the preparation and                 
              development of inorganic-polymeric membranes for separation                    
              processes.  These composites should combine the structural                     
              strength of inorganic membranes with the high selectivity of                   
              the polymeric varieties.  Fabrication will start with a vinyl                  
              silanation of an inorganic membrane substrate followed by free                 
              radical graft polymerization onto these vinyl moiety surface                   
              sites.  Properties of the final composite can be altered                       
              through the structure of the inorganic support (e.g. pore                      
              size), the density of graft sites, choice of monomeric                         
              species, and the reaction conditions for the polymerization.                   
              Membranes will be tested for hydraulic permeability and for                    
              basic separation performance.                                                  
                                                                                             
                                                                                             
                   Certain membrane processes are well-suited to separations                 
              involving dilute solutions like the purification and                           
              concentration of biomolecules or the removal of heavy metals                   
              from wastewater streams.  Others like pervaporation of                         
              volatile organic mixtures have the potential to replace                        
              distillation as the method of separation.  Materials                           
              development is essential if the expected potential of membrane                 
              separation methods to address important environmental and                      
              industrial problems is to be realized and if the United States                 
              is to continue as a leader in the production and sales of                      
              membranes worldwide.  The ceramic-supported polymeric hybrid                   
              membranes contribute to this effort.
