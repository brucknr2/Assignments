Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This proposal suggests purchasing a cryogenic stage and                        
              controlled vitrification system for cryogenic electron                         
              microscopy.  The system will be used to study the structure of                 
              nanometer sized ceramic and metallic particles precipitated or                 
              reduced inside the microdomains of vesicles.                                   
                                                                                             
              The production of nanosized particles in the microdomain                       
              reactors of vesicles and microemulsions represents and                         
              emerging technology with important applications.  The purchase                 
              of the cryogenic system will easily allow for the rapid                        
              cooling of samples, thereby preserving the structure in its                    
              original state.  Electron microscopic examination of these                     
              samples will provide information on the structure, kinetics                    
              and size distribution of the precipitated particles which will                 
              be of great use in tailoring process conditions to particle                    
              functionality.
