Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Copper is among the most common metals in biological systems, yet              
              elevated copper ion levels are toxic to microorganisms and higher              
              organisms.  Cells have developed highly conserved mechanisms and               
              divergent strategies to reduce the deleterious effects of excess               
              copper in the cell.  It is known that copper induces the production            
              of an extracellular protein with affinity for copper in a common               
              marine bacterium, Vibrio alginolyticus.  This project examines two             
              hypotheses:  (1) copper-binding protein induction is a specific                
              response to elevated metal levels and (2) the microbial metal-                 
              binding proteins contribute significantly to regulation of the                 
              levels of bio-available copper in the ocean.  Dr. Harwood will                 
              clone the copper-binding protein gene, which encodes the copper-               
              induced, copper-binding protein.  An oligonucleotide probe specific            
              to the copper-binding protein will be developed and tested with                
              natural populations of marine microbes in order to determine the               
              efficacy of copper-binding protein probes for detecting the gene               
              sequene and gene expression in natural waters.
