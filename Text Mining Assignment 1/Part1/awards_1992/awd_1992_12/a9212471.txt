Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This U.S.-Hungary research project on "Mathematical Models of the              
              Cell Division Cycle" is between Dr. John J. Tyson of Virginia                  
              Polytechnic Institute & State University, and Dr. Bela Novak of                
              the Technical University, Budapest.  Recent molecular studies                  
              have revealed four classes of proteins that participate                        
              prominently in the division control mechanism.  Two proteins                   
              (cdc2 and cyclin) combine to form a heterodimer ("mitosis                      
              promoting factor," or MPF) that, when activated, triggers all the              
              major events of mitosis and cell division.  The activity of MPF                
              is, in turn, controlled by protein kinases and protein                         
              phosphatases that determine the phosphorylation state of MPF.                  
              The goal of this joint project is to develop mathematical models               
              of the cell division cycle, in order to build secure, reliable                 
              connections between molecular details of the control mechanism                 
              and classical observations of the behavior of the intact                       
              regulatory system.  The model will describe the regulation of the              
              MPF activity by phosphorylation, and how the phosphorylation                   
              state of MPF is determined by the DNA-to-protein ratio of the                  
              cell.  The research should yield a mathematical tool to refine                 
              assumptions and guide reasoning about the essential events of                  
              cell growth and division.                                                      
                                                                                             
              This research in cell biology and mathematics fulfills the                     
              program objective of advancing science by enabling leading                     
              experts in the United States and Hungary to combine complementary              
              talents and pool research resources in areas of strong mutual                  
              interest and competence.
