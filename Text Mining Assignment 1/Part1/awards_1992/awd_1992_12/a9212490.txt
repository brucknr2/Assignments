Abstract    :
              The major use of this equipment will                                           
              be for the development of a novel                                              
              drug delivery system comprised of                                              
              microencapsulated liposomes and                                                
              designed to produce devices that                                               
              deliver drugs in either a pulsatile                                            
              fashion, or in response to an                                                  
              external trigger.  Liposomes, the                                              
              major component of the proposed drug                                           
              delivery device, range in size from                                            
              20 to 3500 nanometers.  They are                                               
              lamellar particles consisting of                                               
              highly ordered concentric                                                      
              phospholipid bilayers, and require                                             
              a high speed centrifuge to be                                                  
              separated from solutions in which                                              
              they are suspended.  This equipment                                            
              is capable of separating micron and                                            
              submicron sized particles by                                                   
              sedimentation at high g values, and                                            
              would, therefore, be very useful in                                            
              both the preparation of the                                                    
              liposomes and the monitoring of the                                            
              delivery profile from the drug                                                 
              delivery devices.
