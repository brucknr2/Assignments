Abstract    :
              The primary objectives of the proposed project is to advance                   
              understanding of the interaction of ring current ions with                     
              magnetospheric hydromagnetic waves.  In particular, wave excitation            
              by magnetic drift-bounce resonance with energetic (100-200 keV)                
              ring current protons and the self-consistent nonlinear evolution of            
              the waves and the ring current ions (H+ and O+) will be considered.            
              The methods employed will include (i) numerical solutions of linear            
              gyrokinetic eigenmode equations using existing computer codes, (ii)            
              simulations of the motion of ring current ions in hydromagnetic                
              waves using an existing gyroaveraged Hamiltonian test particle                 
              code, (iii) development of a 3D dipole geometry magnetohydrodynamic            
              (MHD) code and (iv) coupling of the test-particle and MHD codes to             
              produce a hybid MHD-gyrokinetic code.  The hybrid code will be                 
              developed separately on a CRAY-YMP computer and also on a massively            
              paralle CM-2 Connection Machine.  It is expected that the CM-2 MHD-            
              gyrokinetic simulation system will be faster than the CRAY version             
              and will be capable of handling a larger simulation region.  The               
              results will provide the first simulation of the excitation and                
              nonlinear evolution of magnetospheric hydromagnetic waves due to               
              ring current ions, and of the self-consistent effect of the waves              
              on the ions.  Comparisons with spacecraft data will be made to test            
              the theoretical predictions and yield new theoretical insights into            
              observed wave properties and associated particle measurements.
