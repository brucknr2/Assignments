Abstract    :
                   Agamospermy, the asexual production of seeds, occurs in a wide            
              variety of flowering plants.  In groups where hybridization,                   
              polyploidy, and agamospermy are combined, an agamic complex is                 
              formed.  The Crepis occidentalis agamic complex is among the best              
              known and most frequently cited examples of an agamic complex.                 
              This research will use restriction site variation in chloroplast               
              and nuclear ribosomal DNA, as will as allozyme variation, to                   
              examine the origin, development, and maintenance of this complex.              
              The relationship of the North American taxa to other sections of               
              the genus, the relationships among North American species, and the             
              origins of polyploids within the complex will be evaluated with                
              restriction site data.  The genetic structure of the agamic                    
              population will be examined using allozyme variation.  Results from            
              this research will have implications for taxonomic treatment of                
              this and other agamic complexes and will serve as a model for                  
              combining traditional and molecular methods in the study of agamic             
              complexes in plants.  This study will greatly add to the                       
              understanding of the adaptive radiation and spread of this group               
              and help explain how genetic variation is introduced, distributed,             
              and maintained in agamic complexes.
