Abstract    :
              The objective of this research is to use recent advances to                    
              develop the experimental and interpretive means to characterize                
              fractures in rock and concrete. Recent advances in the                         
              understanding of the effects of discontinuities on seismic wave                
              transmission make it feasible to locate and characterize                       
              macroscopic discontinuities in rock and concrete structures, as                
              well as to determine their strength and deformability parameters.              
              These characterizations will then be used in a Discontinuous                   
              Deformation Analysis (DDA) model to build a numerical simulation               
              that evaluates the overall properties of the defective zone                    
              within the structure or foundation. The methods will be developed              
              in the laboratory, tested in bench scale experiments, and applied              
              in a series of preliminary field trials.
