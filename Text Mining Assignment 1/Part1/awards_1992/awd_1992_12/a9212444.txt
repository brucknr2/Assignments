Abstract    :
              The interaction of high energy                                                 
              femtosecond through picosecond laser                                           
              pulses with solid targets provides                                             
              a bright source of incoherent soft                                             
              X-rays.  In this Engineering                                                   
              Research Equipment Grant, two                                                  
              experiments are described which                                                
              employ the interaction of energetic                                            
              femtosecond through 100 ps pulses                                              
              with solid targets.  These                                                     
              experiments require the use of soft                                            
              X-ray spectrometer (~10-400A range)                                            
              to monitor the hot plasma emission.                                            
              The first experiment has as its aim                                            
              the efficient and high average power                                           
              generation of 0.1-1 KeV X-rays for                                             
              eventual application to soft X-ray                                             
              lithography.  By preparing                                                     
              appropriately shaped and sized short                                           
              plasma density scalelengths and                                                
              adjusting the input polarization,                                              
              pulse length, and incidence angle of                                           
              a short laser pulse of ~2-20 mJ                                                
              energy, the generation of 0.1-1 KeV                                            
              X-rays with at least 10% efficiency                                            
              is expected.  This will provide a                                              
              proof-of-principle for scaling to                                              
              very high repetition rate laser                                                
              systems.  A second use for the                                                 
              spectrometer will be the monitoring                                            
              of soft X-ray emission from                                                    
              femtosecond laser-produced plasmas.                                            
              This has applications in the                                                   
              production of an ultrashort pulse X-                                           
              ray source and in the study of the                                             
              unique, high-density, non-ideal                                                
              plasmas produced in the interaction.
