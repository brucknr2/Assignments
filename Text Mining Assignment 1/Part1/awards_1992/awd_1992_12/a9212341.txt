Abstract    :
              Matching funds are provided to support purchase of an adhesion                 
              tester.  The equipment will be used in a study of the properties               
              of the adhesion of CVD silicon dioxide films to polyimide                      
              composites.  The films are being developed for elevated oxidation              
              protection.  The adhesion results will be compared with process                
              parameters and substrate microstructure.
