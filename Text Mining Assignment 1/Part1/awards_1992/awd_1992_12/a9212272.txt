Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The PI proposes to purchase a ASAP 2000 MicroPore sorptometer                  
              (an adsorption porosimeter) from Micromeritics.  The                           
              instrument measures the surface area, pore volume, and                         
              micropore (20 A) and mesopore (20-500 A) size distribution of                  
              a porous solid sample based on the physical adsorption of N2.                  
              A volumetric method is used to measure the adsorption and                      
              desorption isotherms over a large pressure range, and from                     
              these the pore characteristics of the material can be                          
              calculated.                                                                    
                                                                                             
              The PI will use this instrument in his research on the sol-gel                 
              preparation of ceramic membranes.  In particular this                          
              instrument will allow for (1) the elucidation of the effects                   
              of sintering temperature and hostile processing environment on                 
              the pore structure al alumina, zirconia and titantia                           
              membranes, (2) examination of pore structures of                               
              hydrothermally stable separation membranes made of silica-                     
              alumina or silica magnesia binary systems and (3) establishing                 
              pore structures in alumina, zirconia and titania membranes                     
              doped with materials to improve their thermal stability.  The                  
              advanced ceramic membranes that the PI is researching have                     
              many potential applications, especially in the gas separations                 
              area, and the porosimeter is essential for characterizing                      
              these membranes.
