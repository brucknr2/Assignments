Abstract    :
              This award, of $390,000, is for the development of optoelectronic              
              packaging science technology and related curriculum.  This is a                
              joint effort between the Electrical and Computer Engineering                   
              Department at the University of California, San Diego and the                  
              Mechanical Engineering Department at the University of Colorado at             
              Boulder.  The joint effort will address the alignment, assembly,               
              and CAD issues of packaging optoelectronic parallel computing                  
              systems, using leverage from the existing strengths of both                    
              institutions.  The two complementary research efforts -- in a                  
              critical area driving U.S. economic competitiveness -- will be                 
              integrated into an educational program by means of curriculum                  
              development.  Existing courses will be modified and new courses                
              will be added to expedite transferring new research results to the             
              classrooms.
