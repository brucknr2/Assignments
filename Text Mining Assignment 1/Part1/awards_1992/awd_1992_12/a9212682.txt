Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Funded through an Engineering Research Equipment Grant,                        
              equipment will be purchased for use in a diverse set of                        
              computational research thrusts which model details important                   
              to:  chemical vapor deposition, polymer processing, liquid                     
              crystal mixture behavior, and enzyme catalysis.  The equipment                 
              is a high performance graphics workstation.                                    
                                                                                             
              The research is relevant to a variety of engineering systems,                  
              ranging over chemical, mechanical, and bio-engineering.
