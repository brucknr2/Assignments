Abstract    :
                  9212976  Reed    This is the third year of a three-year continuing grant.  
              Understanding the dynamics of massively parallel computer systems  is critical
              to advancing the state of the scientific art.   Increasing numbers of scientist
              use high-performance computer  systems as their only tool.  However, it is
              impossible to  accurately predict performance of application programs of
              massively  parallel procesor systems and it is difficult to identify the 
              reasons for poor performance.  This work is to use a head-mounted  display and
              virtual reality technology to develop virtual  environment representations of
              the time varying state of a parallel  computer system.  Immersion view models
              will be developed for data  representation and process control.  Much of the
              work will focus on  the development of appropriate visual and aural idioms for
              computer  and application scientists, making immersive performance analysis 
              readily understandable.
