Abstract    :
                   This project will relieve the overcrowded conditions at the               
              herbarium of the University of Nebraska Museum.  The collection                
              of plants has regional and national importance and is                          
              particularly strong in recording the plants from the Great                     
              Plains. The collection is used by students and researchers at the              
              university and elsewhere for teaching and research on Great                    
              Plains and botanical biodiversity.  This project will ensure                   
              adequate housing and conservation of this important collection.
