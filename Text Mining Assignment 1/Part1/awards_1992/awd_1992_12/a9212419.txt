Abstract    :
                   This is a three year research project which has as its                    
              purpose the study of computationally intensive methods in                      
              classification (pattern recognition) and regression (noisy                     
              prediction) where the data is high-dimensional and nonlinear.                  
              The research involves new approaches to binary tree structured                 
              methods, with the goal of significantly improving on the accuracy              
              and flexiblity of the present, widely used tree structured                     
              methods initiated by the book and software presented by Breiman                
              et. al. (1984).                                                                
                   The advances in methodology will be useful in the many and                
              diverse areas that make use of classification and prediction.                  
              Current areas of interest including speech recognition, image                  
              processing, medical diagnosis, and handwritten and printed                     
              charactor recognition.                                                         
                   There will be five areas of concentration.  Two of these are              
              based on recent work by Breiman (1991) for efficiently fitting                 
              very high dimensional noisy data by continuously joined                        
              hyperplane segments.  Similar algorithms will be used to                       
              construct trees by fitting hyperplanes in the nodes, and by using              
              multivariate "ramp" functions to construct continuous                          
              approximations to prediction surfaces.                                         
                   The other three areas include a promising method for                      
              optimizing trees, making them multi-step optimal instead in one-               
              step at present, hyperplane splitting for multiple response trees              
              and a new method for doing penalized linear prediction.  This                  
              latter method, called Bridge Regression, offers hope of providing              
              uniformly better prediction than ordinary least squares.
