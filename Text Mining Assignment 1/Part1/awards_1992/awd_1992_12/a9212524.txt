Abstract    :
                   High resolution recording, display, and computing                         
              equipment will be purchased with this award and used in                        
              research projects involving image processing.  The research                    
              will primarily take place in the Digital Image Analysis,                       
              Computer Vision, and the Color Image Processing Laboratories                   
              where projects include a common need for long-term archival                    
              storage of large, multi-dimensional imagery and visualization                  
              of processing results.
