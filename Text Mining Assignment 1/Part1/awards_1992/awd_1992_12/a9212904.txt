Abstract    :
              This equipment grant will be used to purchase a gas                            
              chromatograph for research projects related to combustion and                  
              fuels.  This system will be able to accept either packed                       
              columns or capillary columns, have injectors for either gas or                 
              liquid samples, and have the capability of accepting various                   
              detectors.  The associated data system will be able to                         
              automatically control the GC and acquire data for long-                        
              duration experiments.  Specific projects for which this                        
              instrument will be used are: chlorine-catalyzed oxidation of                   
              chlorinated organic solvents, combustion synthesis of                          
              fullerenes, development of diode lasers as hazardous waste                     
              incinerator monitors, and oxidation of aromatic compounds by                   
              singlet oxygen.                                                                
                                                                                             
              The projects for which this instrument will be first used are                  
              all in the area of chemical kinetics and will have immediate                   
              practical applications such as in hazardous waste destruction                  
              or in synthesis of new materials.
