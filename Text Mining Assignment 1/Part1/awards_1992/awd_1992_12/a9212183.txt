Abstract    :
                   With the increased complexity of distributed and concurrent               
              programs, it becomes necessary to use formal methods to reason about           
              such systems.  This entails new research on using temporal logics and          
              state transition systems to reason about concurrent programs.  The             
              problem of proving properties of systems of processes communicating            
              through message channels that may lose or duplicate messages is                
              investigated.  New methods for automatically verifying properties of           
              such systems specified in different temporal logics are proposed.              
                   Part of the research will be directed towards developing                  
              algorithms for verifying real-time properties of finite state                  
              concurrent programs specified in a branching time temporal logic.              
              New formalisms for specifying real-time behavior of finite-state               
              processes will be investigated.  In addition, new methods for proving          
              correctness of concurrent programs with respect to specifications              
              given by, possibly finite state, nondeterministic automata will be             
              explored.  Research on fault-tolerance in distributed systems will             
              focus on developing new algorithms for achieving fault-tolerance               
              through roll back recovery in distributed systems.  Specifically,              
              efficient algorithms that tolerate arbitrarily spaced crash failures           
              as well as application specific recovery procedures will be                    
              investigated.
