Abstract    :
              The investigators propose to study the biological diversity,                   
              community structure, and energetics of a Neotropical rain forest               
                                                                                             
              canopy ant assemblage.  Although ants are thought to be, in                    
              general, predators and scavengers, they are probably the most                  
              abundant arthropod group in tropical forests trees.  Their                     
              abundance poses an ecological paradox, because predators should                
              not                                                                            
              be more abundant than the herbivores on which they feed.  The                  
              investigators will test the hypothesis that most rain forest                   
              canopy                                                                         
              ants derive the bulk of their energy from plant resources and                  
              function essentially as primary rather than secondary consumers,               
                                                                                             
              which may enable them to support comparatively dense populations.

              determine the composition of the local arboreal ant assemblage                 
              and

              several                                                                        
              of the most abundant ant species will determine the relative                   
              importance of animal and plant matter to their diets; and, the

              will be quantified in order to obtain an estimate of the degree                
              to                                                                             
              which they rely on plant matter as a source of energy.  By

              reliance of ants on plant-derived energy may help explain their                
              abundance, this comprehensive research project will enhance our                
              understanding of fundamental aspects of the biology of tropical
