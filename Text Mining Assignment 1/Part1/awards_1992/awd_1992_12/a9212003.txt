Abstract    :
              This project will investigate the                                              
              benefits of applying interior point                                            
              techniques to learning algorithms                                              
              in neural networks.  The P.I. will                                             
              attempt to show that by using the                                              
              tools of interior point methods, a                                             
              neural network algorithm such as                                               
              back propagation can be improved                                               
              both in learning time and quality                                              
              of solution by optimizing the given                                            
              methods of learning.  As an                                                    
              introductory study, this proposal                                              
              will investigate the effects on                                                
              learning in BP by studying a method                                            
              of analytical centers (Huard 1967,

              similar approach was developed and                                             
              investigated by Trafalis (1989),

              The proposed research would be

              The findings of the research will                                              
              then be generalized to cover more                                              
              general activation functions (e.g.                                             
              sigmoid functions); (2) To design,                                             
              implement and computationally test                                             
              the learning algorithms which were
