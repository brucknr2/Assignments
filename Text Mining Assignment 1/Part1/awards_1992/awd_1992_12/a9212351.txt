Abstract    :
              This dissertation project consists of three related components on              
              the impact of legal and political events on the West German steel              
              industry.  Part 1 studies the anticipated profitability changes due            
              to protectionist policies enacted after 1974 on behalf of the                  
              Western European steel industry.  The study focusses on German                 
              steel producers and is based on a stock market event study.  Part              
              2 is devoted to the study of electoral competition and its effects             
              on German federal steel policy after 1974.  The analysis is based              
              on a rational choice model which includes post-election                        
              institutional rivalry as a novel component.  Part 3 focusses on the            
              distorting effects of political precommitments to supply                       
              protectionist policy measures on the investment and output behavior            
              of steel producers.  Based on a theoretical model, the study                   
              analyzes the role of the Treaty of Paris (1951) as a determinant               
              for the long-term development of European Steel after 1974.                    
                                                                                             
              The results of this research are theoretically and methodologically            
              important in the areas of economics, political science, and law and            
              social science.  Also, its policy implications are provocative.                
              The United States is surrounded by countries in which governments              
              take a much more active role in the regulation of economic change.             
              In Western Europe, industrial policy has become an essential                   
              instrument for securing a long-term growth and employment base.                
              The EC authorities and national governments guided and regulated               
              the structural adjustment of the EC steel industry and, today                  
              unlike the U.S., European steel producers are again competitive on             
              the world market.  Also, as the nations in Western Europe move                 
              closer to a "United Europe," it is more important than ever for the            
              U.S. to learn more about how the European market place is                      
              interconnected with political institutions on the various levels               
              of the political hierarchy to be able to take advantage of the                 
              newly developing economic opportunities.
