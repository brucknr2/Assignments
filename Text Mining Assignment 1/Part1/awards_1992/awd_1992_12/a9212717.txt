Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This project involves the dissertation research of an                          
              anthropology student from the University of Florida.  The project              
              studies the reasons why elderly Black Americans suffering from                 
              hypertension follow or ignore the dietary suggestions of their                 
              medical care givers.  The student will interview 40 informants                 
              using a standardized model of "Health Beliefs" as well as other                
              standardized measures of medical knowledge and personality.  The               
              purpose will be to explain variations in people's culturally-                  
              determined diet patterns.                                                      
                                                                                             
              This research is important because the elderly Black population                
              is an expanding portion of the nation, and is disproportionally                
              susceptible to hypertension.  This study will help medical care                
              givers understand why some people follow a medically approved                  
              diet while others do not deviate from their childhood diets rich               
              in fat, calories and salt.  The knowledge can be useful to those               
              designing programs of public education about how to treat                      
              hypertension.
