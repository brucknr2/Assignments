Abstract    :
              The Department of Civil Engineering at the Kansas City                         
              engineering program of the University of Missouri will purchase                
              computing equipment which will be dedicated to support research                
              in computational aspect of geo-modelling, micromechanics of                    
              materials, and computer aided design in structures and                         
              geomechanics. The equipment will be specifically used in: 1.                   
              Large scale simulation in particulate mechanics; 2. Methodologies              
              for design and performance prediction; 3. Thermal stratification               
              problems of fossil units.
