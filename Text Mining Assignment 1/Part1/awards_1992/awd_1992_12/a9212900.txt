Abstract    :
              The School of Electrical Engineering at                                        
              Cornell University will purchase Scanning                                      
              Tunneling Microscope equipment and software                                    
              which will be dedicated to support research in                                 
              engineering.  The equipment will be used for                                   
              several research projects, including in                                        
              particular: the NSF sponsored project                                          
              "Microdynamics and Nanodynamics: Materials                                     
              Structure and Devices:  the Semiconductor                                      
              Research Corporation project, "Massively                                       
              Parallel Electron Beam Architecture for                                        
              Electron Beam Lithography; and a DARPA                                         
              sponsored project (with Raytheon) on RF                                        
              Vacuum Microelectronics.  All these projects                                   
              use 20 nm diameter silicon tips or arrays of                                   
              silicon tips to produce tunneling microscope                                   
              devices or to produce field emitter arrays for                                 
              electron beam instrumentation, or vacuum                                       
              microelectronic devices.  We have designed a                                   
              unique nanoelectromechanical instrument:  a                                    
              high-speed (5 MHz) scanning tunneling device                                   
              to be used to make unique sensors to detect                                    
              sound, radiation, mass, pressure, and                                          
              acceleration.

              equipment and software requested in this                                       
              proposal will be used to drive our                                             
              nanoelectromechanical tunneling devices and                                    
              to characterize the tip formation processed for                                
              both silicon field and tunneling tip structures.
