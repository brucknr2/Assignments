Abstract    :
              The purpose of this study is to develop and test a theory for the              
              launching and propagation of extremely low frequency (ELF) waves               
              from lightning discharges.  Recent observations have indicated that            
              ELF wavelets from lightning deposit significant energy in the                  
              mesosphere and ionosphere.  This energy may modify upper                       
              atmospheric currents and affect the global electrical circuit.  The            
              investigators will develop a theory for ELF propagation and examine            
              its validity by analyzing existing data on lightning discharges on             
              Earth and other planets.
