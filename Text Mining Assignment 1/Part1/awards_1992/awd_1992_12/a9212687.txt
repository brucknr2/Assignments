Abstract    :
              An intensified CCD (Charged Coupled Device) camera will be                     
              purchased with this equipment grant; initially, this system                    
              will be dedicated to experiments on the study of mixing and                    
              combustion in supersonic flow environments.  When coupled with                 
              a dedicated pulsed dye-laser system, this equipment will allow                 
              non-intrusive Planar Laser-Induced Fluorescence (PLIF) studies                 
              of concentration, velocity, temperature  and pressure in an                    
              existing large-scale facility designed for fundamental studies                 
              of supersonic combustion, allowing first-time non-intrusive                    
              fundamental measurements of the nature and mechanisms of                       
              mixing and combustion in compressible environments over a                      
              broad range of flow conditions.  Such results will be used for                 
              comparison with ongoing numerical simulations and for                          
              development and validation of compressible mixing and                          
              combustion models.                                                             
                                                                                             
              Supersonic mixing and combustion processes are of major                        
              interest for a future generation of supersonic/hypersonic                      
              propulsion systems.  There are numerous critical                               
              processes/problems associated with this combustion mode;                       
              accurate experimental characterization of flow velocities,                     
              pressures, temperatures, and species concentrations are needed                 
              for development of an understanding of these phenomena and                     
              definition of approaches to achieving efficient fuel                           
              utilization under supersonic combustion conditions.  There are                 
              numerous open questions in this area which this facility will                  
              be uniquely suited to investigate.
