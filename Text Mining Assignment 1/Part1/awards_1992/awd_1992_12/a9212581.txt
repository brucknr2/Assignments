Abstract    :
              Two regulatory proteins alpha 1 and MCM1 from the yeast                        
              Saccharomyces cerevisiae cooperate to activate transcription of                
              alpha cell type specific genes.  MCM1 protein, which is homologous             
              to the mammalian serum response factor, is a multifunctional                   
              protein implicated in several processes in the yeast cell.  Both               
              the alpha 1  and MCM1 proteins bind their DNA recognition sequence             
              in both duplex and single stranded DNA.  Since most DNA binding                
              proteins recognize B form DNA and contact the sugar-phosphate                  
              backbone, this is an unexpected activity.  The hypothesis that the             
              proteins unwind duplex DNA to generate single stranded DNA will be             
              tested; thus two apparently different activities could be in                   
              reality a single activity.  The relationship between the duplex and            
              single strand binding activities will be analyzed by comparing 1)              
              the protein-DNA contracts, 2) the sequence requirements for binding            
              and 3) the domains of the proteins required for each type of                   
              binding. Selection of a alpha 1 mutations in vivo will be used to              
              extend mapping of the domains.  The unusual binding properties of              
              other proteins are integral to their function.

              This research, which deals with issues potentially very important              
              for eukaryotic gene expression, has the potential for wide                     
              applicability in biotechnology. It is an interesting and                       
              potentially significant phenomenon, and the research planned will              
              help to delineate the biological role for the unusual findings to              
              date.  The planned research will also provide useful training for              
              student associated with the project.
