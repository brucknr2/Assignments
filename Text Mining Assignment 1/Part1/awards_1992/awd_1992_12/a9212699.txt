Abstract    :
                   The Department of Mathematics of The University of Wisconsin              
              - Madison, with subcontracts to the Departments of Mathematics of              
              Colby College and the University of California - Davis, will                   
              purchase, at an estimated price of $37,500, equipment to support               
              research in the mathematical sciences.  The equipment consists of              
              dedicated CAM-8 workstations, high-performance pseudo-parallel                 
              processors that enable video visualization of a wide variety of                
              lattice dynamics at a speed of 25 million cell updates per                     
              second.  Companion hardware and software will also be purchased                
              as the budget permits.  This equipment will aid Professors D.                  
              Griffeath (Wisconsin), R. Fisch (Colby) and J. Gravner (UC-Davis)              
              in their research on complex random systems.  The three                        
              investigators rely heavily on computer experimentation and                     
              graphics in their collaborative and individual research.  Primary              
              benefits anticipated from the present request are as follows.
