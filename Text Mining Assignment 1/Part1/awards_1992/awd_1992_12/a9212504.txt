Abstract    :
              The proposed research is on fault modeling and test generation for             
              mixed signal integrated circuits.  In the area of fault models,                
              defect and yield statistics are being used to derive comprehensive             
              fault models for analog circuits.  These include functional fault              
              models useable in design for test and test generation.  New test               
              generation algorithms are being derived for analog circuits, and               
              techniques are being developed to interface the analog tests with              
              the digital circuitry in a mixed signal circuit.  The fundamental              
              theories are being validated experimentally with designs and data              
              from industry.
