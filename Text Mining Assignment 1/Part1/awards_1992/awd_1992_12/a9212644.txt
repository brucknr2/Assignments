Abstract    :
                    This award is to conduct the annual grantees conference of               
              the Division of Design and Manufacturing Systems.  By encouraging              
              interaction between the grantees of this Division, the Engineering             
              Research Centers Division and some of the grantees of the Computer             
              Information Science and Engineering Directorate, this conference               
              ensures that the individual researchers are informed about the                 
              ongoing activities of their colleagues.  An elimination of                     
              duplication of their efforts may be achieved and a degree of                   
              cooperation may result from this activity.  An overall improvement             
              of efficiency of the research activity could be expected.  In                  
              addition, the conference program organization allows for ample time            
              to discuss manufacturing research in detail with the collective                
              research community at the meeting, with feedback and input from the            
              National Science Foundation.  Finally, personal contacts with the              
              grantees and program officers in the Divisions should contribute               
              to clarifying many current problems in their work.                             
                   Principal investigators attending the conference usually gain             
              a one to two year lead on the information disseminated; this is the            
              usual time frame for materials presented at the conference to be               
              published in journals and other literature.
