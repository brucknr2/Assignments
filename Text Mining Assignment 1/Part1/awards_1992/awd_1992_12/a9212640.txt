Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This research project is dedicated to answering three basic                    
              questions about the development of the visual system:  1) how do               
              nerve cells connect to each other; 2) how do nerve cells know where            
              to connect to each other and 3) how does nerve cell activity                   
              influence the connections?  The answers can be found by studying               
              the prenatal and postnatal development of the cat visual system,               
              which is remarkably similar to that in the human.                              
                                                                                             
              During development the connections nerve cells make are not the                
              same as those found in the adult.  It is important, therefore, to              
              ascertain what determines which connections are eliminated or                  
              preserved.  Although it is known that activity influences which                
              connections nerve cells make, it is not clear how it is done.  This            
              project will study the anatomy and physiology of developing nerve              
              cells and whether certain types of "growth-associated proteins"                
              (GAP) regulate this process.  Studying the processes regulating                
              normal development can further our understanding of defects of the             
              visual system.
