Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Funded through an Engineering Research Equipment Grant, a                      
              Rheometrics Dynamic Analyzer and associated peripherals will                   
              be purchased for research on the characterization of polymeric                 
              fluids and networks.  The focus on the research is on the                      
              coupling between mechanical properties and thermodynamic                       
              swelling in materials.                                                         
                                                                                             
              Such information is of importance in the design and processing                 
              of polymeric materials.
