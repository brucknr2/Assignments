Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The Brookings Institution will convene a planning meeting                      
              of U.S. and Russian scientists which is intended to lead                       
              to a larger workshop, in Russia, involving U.S. basic                          
              research scientists and engineers and former Soviet                            
              weapons researchers.  The objective of these meetings is                       
              to identify areas and topics of civilian-oriented basic                        
              research in which former Soviet weapons scientists can                         
              work in concert with American researchers as well as to                        
              identify potential partnerships between specific ex-Soviet                     
              and American researchers.  Proposals for actual support of                     
              such research will subsequently be  submitted to the State                     
              Department's Special Coordinator on FSU Non-Proliferation                      
              Policy and considered for funding either under the                             
              International Science Center that has recently been                            
              created by the Department of State or conceivably under                        
              existing bilateral arrangements, including the NSF's                           
              cooperative science programs.
