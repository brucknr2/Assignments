Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              An experimental technique for unsteady flow measurements will                  
              be further developed. The technique involves the tagging                       
              through laser exitation of molecules in a flow field, forming                  
              a line written in the flow. This line is then interrogated                     
              during its susequent deformation by rapid laser pulses. The                    
              technique can give statistical turbulence information without                  
              intruding instruments within the flow. The writing of crossed                  
              lines or grids can give data for vorticity and shear.                          
                                                                                             
              Non-intrusive measurement techniques are important for                         
              extracting flow details from highly transient flows, where                     
              instabilities and turbulence are as yet insufficiently                         
              characterized for predictive modeling purposes.
