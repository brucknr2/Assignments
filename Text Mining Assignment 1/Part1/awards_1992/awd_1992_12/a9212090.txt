Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              A Research Planning Grant is sought in connection with the                     
              establishment of a physics research laboratory.  The research will             
              comprise a study of the stability of colloidal suspensions in                  
              aqueous solutions in the presence of alternating electric fields.              
              Computer simulations will also be carried out, aimed at developing             
              a possible model for the system.
