Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  This Research Planning Grant will be used to assess the                   
              feasibility of conducting a long-term study that would provide a               
              major theoretical and methodological advancement of previous                   
              research on trends in female labor force participation.  The                   
              study will determine the feasibility of developing more refined                
              measures of supply and demand for women's labor by, and develop a              
              more comprehensive model of women's labor force participation.                 
              The planning activities consist of locating appropriate data,                  
              developing measures of supply and demand, and developing the                   
              statistical models.  If the outcome of the planning phase is                   
              positive, then the research resulting from it can be expected to               
              make a major contribution to the sociological study of women's                 
              labor force participation in the United States.
