Abstract    :
              This equipment grant will be used for acquisition of a high-                   
              speed data acquisition and analysis system which will be used                  
              with an existing five nanosecond pulse-width laser for                         
              combustion studies.  The system will allow for acquisition of                  
              sufficient data over the 5 nanosecond pulse width of an                        
              existing degenerate four-wave mixing laser combustion                          
              diagnostic to determine the temporal response of the system.                   
              In addition to acquiring the data, this system will process                    
              the information to provide a real-time measure of the                          
              performance of the combustion diagnostic system.                               
                                                                                             
              In its initial application, this data acquisition system will                  
              be integrated into an in-situ pulse laser based diagnostic for                 
              measurement of hydroperoxy radicals generated during the                       
              combustion of hydrocarbons.  This technique utilizes                           
              degenerate four-wave mixing of a low-lying absorption band of                  
              HO2 which is unique to that molecule, not having the                           
              spectroscopic interference problems associated with other                      
              absorption bands of this molecule in the fingerprint region of                 
              the electromagnetic spectrum.  Successful completion of this                   
              research program will provide a new diagnostic tool to probe                   
              hydrocarbon oxidation and provide new insight into the                         
              chemistry which limits efficiency and controls emissions from                  
              hydrocarbon combustion systems.
