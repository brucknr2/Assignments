Abstract    :
              The end objective of the research is to correlate the structural               
              condition of portland cement concrete facilities with the test                 
              results using electromagnetic waves, eddy current, and ultrasonic              
              techniques.  Electromagnetic and ultrasonic methods have                       
              previously shown promise for achieving this objective.  Eddy                   
              currents are used as complementary technique. However, before the              
              end objective can be addressed, it is important to clearly                     
              establish a scientific/engineering data base from which the                    
              electromagnetic, electrical, and ultrasonic properties of                      
              portland cement structures can be obtained.  This database will                
              provide insight and understanding of other problems arising from               
              the interaction of these electrical/acoustic methods with                      
              concrete structures and will be made available to other                        
              researchers considering similar NDE methods.  This data base                   
              represents the first attempt to set up and carry out, under                    
              controlled conditions, a comprehensive set of measurements to                  
              characterize a select set of concrete specimens using a basic                  
              electrical and ultrasonic techniques that have only been                       
              estimated in previous research.
