Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              New methodologies have opened up the possibility of discovering how            
              young infants perceive the world around them, and even how they                
              think about it.  This research will examine the relations between              
              infants' representations of objects and substances and early                   
              language learning.  The studies will establish the ways in which               
              language learning requires children to conceputalize the world in              
              new terms and the ways in which language learning simply requires              
              children to learn how their language expresses the concepts they               
              already possess.                                                               
                                                                                             
              One series of studies will explore how babies establish                        
              representations of distinct objects in their environment, and how              
              they track identity of these objects over time.  Previous research             
              has discovered a change in the criteria for object individuation               
              and object identity beginning around eleven months of age that is              
              related to learning to comprehend object labels.                               
                                                                                             
              Other series of studies will explore the processes underlying word             
              learning by 2- to 4-year-old children, documenting continuing                  
              changes in lexical representations throughout the preschool years.             
                                                                                             
              These studies will shed light on fundamental questions concerning              
              the relations between language and thought.  Furthermore, they will            
              contribute to a deeper understanding of normal language and                    
              cognitive development, in terms of which abnormal development can              
              be better understood.
