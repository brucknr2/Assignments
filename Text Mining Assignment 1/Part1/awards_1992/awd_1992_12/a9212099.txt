Abstract    :
              Certain suspensions of fine particles in a dielectric liquid                   
              will change rheological behavior in the presence of a strong                   
              electric field. These suspensions are called                                   
              electrorheological (ER) fluids, and there has been                             
              considerable interest in exploiting their unique behavior for                  
              a wide variety of hydraulic devices such as clutches and                       
              valves. The objective of this research is to experimentally                    
              investigate the convective heat transfer characteristics of ER                 
              fluids and to identify parameters specific to ER fluid flow                    
              which may be imporvant to the heat transfer of these fluids.                   
              Heat transfer measurements will be made by radiatively                         
              imposing a known heat flux at one surface of a channel flow                    
              and optically measuring local temperatures at the surface.                     
              With this information, local heat transfer coefficients will                   
              be determined by estimating the local bulk fluid temperature                   
              in the channel. Such information on thermal transport will be                  
              important for design in many of the applications proposed for                  
              ER fluids.
