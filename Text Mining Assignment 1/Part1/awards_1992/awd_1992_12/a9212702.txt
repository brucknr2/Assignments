Abstract    :
                Long term work in Dr. T. H. Dunnebacke's laboratory, provocative             
              but generally ignored, has shown that an agent from amoebae of                 
              Naegleria gruberi induces generations-delayed death of vertebrate              
              cells in culture, and that these dying cells in turn produce an                
              agent that causes death of other vertebrate cells.  This remarkable            
              phenomenon has been confirmed, and it has been shown that the cell             
              death has features characteristic of apoptosis.  The first goal is             
              to complete and carefully document these new observations.                     
              Dunnebacke has purified the agent from amoebae, and has identified             
              it as a protein, which has been partially sequenced.  The plan, in             
              collaboration with Dunnebacke, is to use her information to clone              
              the Naegleria gene that encodes the protein, to sequence and                   
              characterize this gene and its product, and to determine whether               
              the isolated protein is responsible for the biological activity of             
              the agent.                                                                     
                                                                                             
              These studies should make this phenomenon a paradigm for future                
              investigations of: 1, the mechanism by which a protein induces                 
              generations-delayed apoptosis; 2, how a protein from an amoeba can             
              lead to the production, by dying vertebrate cells, of a product                
              with similar biological activity, as well as the nature of the                 
              vertebrate product; and 3, possible therapeutic applications of the            
              protein.
