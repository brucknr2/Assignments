Abstract    :
                   This study will assess N-fixation in rhizosheath forming and               
                                                                                            
              non-rhizosheath forming plants.  For the first time.  The                      
              quantity of nitrogen (N) rhizosheath forming plants obtain from                
              either atmospheric or soil sources will be quantified 15N isotope              
                                                                                             
              dilution methods.                                                              
                   The function of rhizosheath roots in hydraulic lift will                  
              also be measured.  Rhizosheath soil may act as sinks for deep                  
              soil moisture supplies (hydraulic lift) or rhizosheath roots may               
                                                                                             
              act as barriers to moisture loss, which can have a direct effect               
                                                                                             
              on microbial activity within rhizosheaths and can significantly                
              alter N-fixation.  Research will determine whether hydraulic lift              
                                                                                             
              of moisture reserves from deep roots to rhizosheath soil occurs                
              and whether hydraulic lift stimulates microbial numbers and N-                 
              fixation in rhizosheaths.
