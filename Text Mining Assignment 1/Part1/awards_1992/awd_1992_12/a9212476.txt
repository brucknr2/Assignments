Abstract    :
                   The objective of this project is to identify factors                      
              responsible for arrested succession in old-fields in a tropical                
              rainforest in Mexico.  Four arrested old-fields will be compared               
                                                                                             
              with four fields in late succession, defined by the abundance of               
                                                                                             
              the indicator species of late succession, Cecropia obtusifolia.                
                                                                                             
              The factors involved in its absence in arrested fields will be                 
              investigated from the seed to the sapling stage.  Soil seed bank               
                                                                                             
              and its viability will be compared between arrested and                        
              non-arrested stages.  Space availability as potential                          
              colonization                                                                   
              sites will equally be compared.  Sown seeds, following two                     
              different densities, will be followed to determine removal by                  
              predators and seed viability.  These will be compared between                  
              stages.  Growth and survival of the seedlings will be compared                 
              between arrested and non-arrested sites, until they reach the                  
              sapling stage.  Microclimatic and edaphic conditions will be                   
              monitored for possible correlation with growth and survival of                 
              the                                                                            
              seedlings.  Factors preventing C. obtusifolia from occurring in                
              arrested sites may indicate forces detaining succession, which                 
              are                                                                            
              important to control fallow periods in traditional agriculture.
