Abstract    :
                   A high power laser will be used for several innovative                    
              research projects on laser processing of materials.  These include             
              beam-splitting for enhanced materials processing; laser-enhanced               
              diffusion welding of high temperature superconducting materials;               
              acoustic emission monitoring of laser weld quality; adaptive                   
              control and interpolators in laser processing operations; and laser            
              machining.                                                                     
                   The goal of the research is to develop innovative laser                   
              processing techniques and to improve basic understanding of the                
              interactions of lasers with materials during processing.  This may             
              lead to improved productivity in the use of lasers in industry.
