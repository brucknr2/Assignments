Abstract    :
              The proposed research investigates the relationship of vascular                
              plant species in abandoned agricultural wetlands to factors of the             
              physical/chemical environment by analyzing their respective spatial            
              patterns.  Large areas of forested peatlands have been cleared for             
              agriculture in the Lake States and in New York.  These wetland                 
              ecosystems undergo extreme alterations upon drainage, clearing, and            
              cultivation, until eventually abandoned.  Currently, state and                 
              federal regulatory agencies and the muckfarming industry debate                
              whether abandoned mucklands are irreversibly altered or revert to              
              naturally functioning systems.  Although much information exists               
              on old-field and forest succession, no studies have investigated               
              successional patterns in abandoned agricultural wetlands.  In 1991,            
              investigations of abandoned mucklands in Oswego County were                    
              initiated.  Examination of photographic records and preliminary                
              field surveys have revealed large variation in species response to             
              mucklands abandoned for different lengths of time.  Measured or                
              observed variability in surface water depth soil solution pH, marl             
              sublayer features, calcium ion concentration, and soil profile                 
              characteristics further indicates nonhomogeneity.  Recognition of              
              spatial heterogeneity of plant distributions is fundamental to                 
              understanding processes of succession.  Patterns and trends will               
              be identified and quantified by using a combination of                         
              geostatistical and geographic information systems (GIS) techniques.
