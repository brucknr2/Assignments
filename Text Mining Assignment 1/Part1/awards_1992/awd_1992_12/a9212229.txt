Abstract    :
              The project involves the data capture into MUSE of approximately               
              114,000 records of fishes in the WHOI collection being transferred             
              to Harvard as well as the older fish collection at the MCZ.  After             
              entry, the data will be verified against the collection using the              
              collection printout.  The database will be made accessible to                  
              scientists and students and will be used for collection management             
              purposes.

              This project will complete the computer cataloguing of the fish                
              collections at the Museum of Comparative Zoology, especially the               
              collection of adult and larval fishes transferred from the Woods               
              Hole Oceanographic Institution.  These collections are unparalleled            
              in documentation and quality and are critical to research on fish              
              biology, diversity and ecology.  The computerization of these                  
              collections will make them much more accessible to scientists and              
              students and increase the role of these fish collections in                    
              research and education.
