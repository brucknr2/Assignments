Abstract    :
              This research project involves the development of a laboratory                 
              facility to investigate the complex interactions between noise,                
              stability and  nonlinear dynamics inherent in mechanical systems.              
              Specifically, the research work consists of conducting dynamics                
              experiments on the behavior of two nonlinear mechanical models.                
              One deals with the transverse vibrations of a rotating shaft                   
              under pulsating axial loads, and the other is the dynamics and                 
              control of coupled torsional and bending vibrations of a thin                  
              beam under nonconservative forces. Experimental measurements                   
              include data leading to statistics such as mean square responses               
              and power spectral densities; Lyapunov exponents, fractal                      
              dimensions and correlation functions of the response coordinates;              
              and probability density and distribution functions. The                        
              laboratory meets the needs of enhancing the experimental skills                
              of graduate students in the areas of dynamics and control.***//
