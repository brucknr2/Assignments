Abstract    :
              An Atomic Force Microscope (AFM) will be purchased to conduct                  
              dedicated experimental research in three areas: (1) nanometer-                 
              scale measurement of temperature and properties of thin solid                  
              films and nano-structures; (2) nanometer-scale measurement of                  
              mechanical properties and frictional forces for fiber-matrix                   
              interfaces in composite materials; and (3) fabrication of                      
              nanometer-scale solid structures for solid state devices and                   
              sensors. Arizona State University will provide 50% of the                      
              instrument cost.
