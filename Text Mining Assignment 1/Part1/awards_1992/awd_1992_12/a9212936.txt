Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  Knowledge of the effects of the social structure on                       
              stratification is largely based on information about Western                   
              capitalist societies.  The different nations and regions of the                
              former Soviet Union provide a diversity of forms of planned                    
              economy.  This diversity in combination with the extraordinary                 
              recent political and socioeconomic changes permits a new                       
              opportunity for deepening our understanding of the effect of social            
              structure on stratification.  This proposal will assemble a data               
              set in preparation for a study of the transition from dependency               
              to adult roles of people born between 1966 and 1968 in the Soviet              
              Union.  These individuals were educated in a fully-developed                   
              socialist society, completed secondary education during the period             
              of Perestroika (1983-1985), and began their job careers during the             
              transition from socialism to a new political and economic system.              
              Specifically, a longitudinal data set on 20,000 secondary school               
              graduates in 13 different regions of the former Soviet Union will              
              be assembled and verified in preparation for a study of the                    
              influence of social structural variables on early life course                  
              transitions.                                                                   
                                                                                             
                   This project will contribute to our understanding of how                  
              societal institutions shape people's lives, and it will thus help              
              to counterbalance the emphasis in the U.S. literature on how                   
              individual characteristics shape people's lives.  The timing and               
              geographic locations of the longitudinal data collections to be                
              completed and assembled in single data set provide a unique                    
              opportunity for studying early life careers.
