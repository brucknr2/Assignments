Abstract    :
              A dynamic mechanical spectroscopy equipment will be purchased to               
              study characterization of fluid, semi-solid, bulk materials,                   
              including polymer melts, liquid crystals, latex polymers,                      
              elastomers, plastics and other polymer combinations.  The work                 
              will study sound and vibration damping in polymeric materials.//
