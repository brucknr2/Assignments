Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This U.S.-Poland research project on "Ethical                                  
              Reasoning Among Public Administrators in the                                   
              New Local Governments in Poland:  A Study of                                   
              Two Provinces" between Drs. Debra W. Stewart                                   
              and Norman A. Sprinthall of the State                                          
              University in Raleigh and Dr. Renata Siemienska                                
              of the University of Warsaw will investigate                                   
              ethical decision making among local public                                     
              administrators in two provinces in Poland.  The                                
              study aims to understand:  1. how non-elected                                  
              public officials in the new Poland exercise                                    
              discretion inherent in the public                                              
              administrative role when they confront ethical                                 
              dilemmas;  2. the variables associated with the                                
              exercise of alternative models of ethical                                      
              reasoning among this group;  3. the                                            
              organizational, contextual, demographic and                                    
              attitudinal correlates of principled reasoning                                 
              among these officials.  Working collaboratively                                
              with investigators in Poland, Dr. Stewart will                                 
              survey 300 local public administrators and                                     
              conduct in-depth interviews with 20 of these                                   
              civil servants in five towns within each of two                                
              provinces in Poland.  As power increasingly                                    
              devolves to local government, it is important                                  
              to know how new managers are using their newly                                 
              sanctioned discretion and how the ethical                                      
              models they employ shape that action.  Data                                    
              generated in this study will lead to a                                         
              comparison of modes of ethical response across                                 
              U.S. and Polish government officials.                                          
                                                                                             
              This project in sociology fulfills the program                                 
              objective of advancing scientific knowledge by                                 
              enabling leading experts in the United States                                  
              and Eastern Europe to combine complementary                                    
              talents and pool resources in areas of strong                                  
              mutual interest and competence.
