Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              What determines private sector expectations about the likely                   
              timing of discrete changes in government policy?  For example,                 
              Central Banks often have control over policy instruments -- such               
              as a nominal exchange rate or a key interest rate -- that can be               
              adjusted discrete and suddenly.  Mark participants appear to form              
              expectations about when these adjustments will occur (and about                
              how large they will be) and these expectations influence their                 
              behavior.  Import payments may be accelerated and exports                      
              postponed in anticipation of a devaluation.  Similarly,                        
              anticipated changes in interest rates may affect the timing of                 
              housing purchases or other investment decisions.  One intuitively              
              appealing model of how market participants might formulate their               
              expectations is a "Threshold" model in which policy changes are                
              expected to occur when some underlying indicator(s) cross a                    
              critical threshold.  The contribution of this research comes from              
              (1) deriving a Threshold model to explain the actual and expected              
              timing of discrete policy changes; (2) developing a methodology                
              for empirically estimating and testing the Threshold model; and                
              (3) suing the Threshold model to study a number of types of                    
              discrete policy changes.                                                       
                                                                                             
              Under certain assumptions the probability functions describing                 
              the expected timing of policy changes will come from an Inverse                
              Gaussian distribution.  This formulation of the Threshold model                
              will be used to study the actual timing of policy changes as                   
              well.  Previous work by the investigator on realignments in the                
              European Monetary System will be extended.  Future research will               
              include a theoretical and empirical analysis of the expectations               
              about the timing of changes in key U.S. interest rates.
