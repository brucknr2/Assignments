Abstract    :
              This equipment is to be used for                                               
              investigations of the (bio)catalytic                                           
              synthesis of polymers in                                                       
              supercritical fluids.  Specifically,                                           
              the identification of enzymes for                                              
              the synthesis of poly(ethylene

              to be carried out.  In addition, the                                           
              use of supercritical fluids as                                                 
              solvents for traditional

              work on the (bio)catalytic                                                     
              transesterification of acrylates has                                           
              produced a set of general guidelines                                           
              for the optimization of enzymatic                                              
              processes in supercritical                                                     
              environments. Using these                                                      
              guidelines, this project is to                                                 
              establish the feasibility of the
