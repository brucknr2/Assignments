Abstract    :
              A sample holder is constructed for a transmission electron                     
              microscope that will allow ex-situ, controlled atmosphere                      
              studies of environmentally sensitive materials.  The device                    
              has capabilities, in particular the ability to treat samples                   
              at atmospheric pressure, that are not available at national                    
              microscopy facilities and offers an advance in electron                        
              microscopy design.                                                             
                                                                                             
              The modified electron microscope will be used to study                         
              morphology of metal particles in heterogeneous catalysis,                      
              corrosive interactions of metal surfaces, and the influence of                 
              environment on dispersed phases of oxides.
