Abstract    :
                   The investigator plans several projects designed to illuminate            
              the dynamic features of computations and the connections between               
              notions of computability in varying environments.  He envisions                
              separate studies on the global theory of various degree structures;            
              the extension of embeddings problem for the recursively enumerable             
              degrees; the relativized formulation of Lerman's theorem on finite             
              ideals in the Turing degrees; Kechris' notion of universal Borel               
              equivalence relations; and abstract complexity theory.                         
                   Prominent among the questions to be addressed by this project             
              are a number that bear on theoretical computability.  They lie in              
              what is known as recursion theory, which deals with a model of                 
              computability knowing no bounds on time or space.  Although answers            
              to such questions have the ability to illuminate practical                     
              questions, they are really practical only when their answers are               
              negative, for it is a very strong statement indeed to say that                 
              something cannot be computed even when one puts no limits on                   
              resources available for the purpose.  The finer structure of                   
              computability theory is sometimes more relevant to actual                      
              computations, and various aspects of that will also be considered.
