Abstract    :
              This project is to expose senior-level undergraduates in electrical            
              and mechanical engineering to recent research advances by focusing             
              on a specific application.  The application selected is the design             
              and control of a walking robot.  The main reasons for this choice              
              are (i) the recent experience of some of the PI's (Azarm,                      
              Dayawansa, Tsai) in directing groups of senior undergraduates to               
              design, build and test rudimentary walking robots (in the context              
              of a course) and (ii) the almost endless possibility of                        
              incorporating advanced concepts and techniques (mechanisms                     
              synthesis, nonlinear control, speech recognition).  The current                
              course will be restructured.  Main aspects will include: (i)                   
              incremental development of a long term (three-year cycle) project,             
              with different focus each year; (ii) emphasis on application of                
              research results obtained by the PI's and their research groups;               
              (iii) creating an environment conducive to interdisciplinary                   
              research and education; (iv) active involvement of graduate                    
              students in transferring their research results to undergraduates              
              and thus complementing more theoretical thesis work; (v) industrial            
              and federal involvement; (vi) strong connection with the ECSEL                 
              program.  This course will be cross-listed in Electrical                       
              Engineering and Mechanical Engineering.
