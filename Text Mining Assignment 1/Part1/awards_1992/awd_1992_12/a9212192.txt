Abstract    :
              This is an award to support research on the                                    
              transport and fate of sulfur dioxide, ozone                                    
              and hydrogen peroxide in selected plant                                        
              species, to use this understanding to                                          
              interpret the results of laboratory and field                                  
              measurements and to calculate the fate of air                                  
              pollutants in the internal regions of plant                                    
              leaves.  Foliar uptake by plants represents                                    
              an important sink for many air pollutants yet                                  
              factors                                                                        
              for characterizing pollutant uptake are used                                   
              in regional atmospheric models are currently                                   
              applied with a large degree of uncertainty.                                    
              For improving these deposition estimates,                                      
              laboratory experiments are needed in which                                     
              gas exchange rates are accurately measured                                     
              and results interpreted to improve the                                         
              transport models and validate their                                            
              predictive capability.  The proposal leading                                   
              to this award was submitted in response to                                     
              NSF 88-99 as modified by changes dated

              Results of this research are expected to                                       
              enhance our understanding of the transport                                     
              and fate of trace gases in plant leaves and                                    
              lead to more effective parameterization of                                     
              deposition and emission rates for vegetation,                                  
              for use in regional air quality models.                                        
              These, in turn can be utilized in improving                                    
              engineering design of processes and systems                                    
              for abatement and control of air pollution.
