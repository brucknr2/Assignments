Abstract    :
              This project provides support for acquisition of                               
              additional testing equipment to upgrade the newly                              
              developed structural engineering research                                      
              laboratory at Clarkson University.  This equipment                             
              includes a new hydraulic pump capable of                                       
              maintaining 3000 psi pressure and flow volumes of                              
              30 gallons per minute, hydraulic pressure control                              
              units, and apparatuses for determination of material                           
              properties of concrete (modulus, and Poisson's                                 
              ratio).  Acquisition of this equipment will improve                            
              the experimental research capability existing and                              
              will lead to greater impact on future code                                     
              development for reinforced concrete structures                                 
              under seismic loads.                                                           
                                                                                             
              This is an equipment grant.
