Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  This research is an experimental and theoretical study on the             
              viscoelastic properties of blends of dissimilar polymers in the                
              entangled fluid state.  Binary blends will first be prepared from              
              well-characterized linear polybutadienes of narrow molecular-weight            
              distribution and variable microstructure.  The heteropolymer                   
              character of these mixtures will be controlled by increasing the               
              disparity of the vinyl group content in the participating                      
              components.  Dynamic-oscillatory, steady-shear, tensile, and step-             
              strain experiments will be utilized in examining the linear and                
              nonlinear viscoelasticity of these systems at several temperatures             
              as a function of composition.  The fluidity, elasticity, and                   
              rigidity of a blend will thus be related to the corresponding                  
              properties of its pure constituents.  Blends of commercial polymers            
              will also be investigated to test whether the conclusions drawn on             
              model polymer mixtures apply to cases of commerical interest.                  
              Especial emphasis will be given on blends where miscibility is                 
              driven by the presence of strong specific interactions.  A                     
              molecular theory already developed to explain the composite network            
              architecture and molecular dynamics in miscible heteropolymer                  
              blends will be extended to accommodate non-ideal behavior.                     
                                                                                             
              This research is part of a general format to understand better the             
              mixing behavior of dissimilar polymer.  A particle outcome would be            
              more efficient processing of recycled plastics, which are typically            
              mixtures.
