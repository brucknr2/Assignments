Abstract    :
              This award, for $390,000, is for the development of integrated                 
              undergraduate educational programs on semiconductor devices for                
              electric power flow control.  The award is motivated by                        
              deregulation in the power industry and concomitant needs for                   
              flexible AC power flow control. At the distribution level, the                 
              semiconductor revolution has penetrated power levels which make                
              adjustable speed drives and other forms of power flow control                  
              possible. Despite great advances in applications of semiconductors             
              in power engineering, there is an absence of educational efforts               
              (courses, texts, software) which integrate topics in semiconductor             
              device physics with power electronic circuits and power                        
              distribution systems.
