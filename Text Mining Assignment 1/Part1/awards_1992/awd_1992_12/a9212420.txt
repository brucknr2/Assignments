Abstract    :
                   This award provides support for graduate student research                 
              focusing on research in approximation theory under investigation               
              by the principal investigator.  The principal investigator's                   
              research is supported by several other government agencies.  Work              
              will center on problems of nonlinear approximation such as that                
              accomplished by wavelet compression, with applications to signal               
              processing.                                                                    
                   Particular emphasis will be placed on question of                         
              multivariate approximation using both wavelets and                             
              rationalapproximation schemes.                                                 
                   Other work concerns applications to image restoration,                    
              neural networks and linear approximation to shift-invariant                    
              spaces.
