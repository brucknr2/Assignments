Abstract    :
              This award, for $390,000, is for the development of the integration            
              of sensors into the Electrical Engineering curriculum.  A                      
              collaborative effort involving university, government, and                     
              industrial researchers will take place to accomplish this                      
              integration.  This effort will foster the transfer of sensor                   
              research expertise into the curriculum.  The transfer will be                  
              accomplished by three new EE courses and an undergraduate sensor               
              laboratory.
