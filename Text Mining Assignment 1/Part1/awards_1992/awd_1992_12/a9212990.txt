Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                                                                                             
                                         ABSTRACT                                            
                                                                                             
                  This research will examine the nature of parents' "working                
              models" of attachment and their impact upon parents' caregiving                
              patterns and upon their children's developing social-emotional                 
              competence.  Working models are defined as cognitive and                       
              affective representations based on parents' current conceptions                
              of their childhood relationships with their own parents.  These                
              models guide parents' strategies for accessing and organizing                  
              information about  ttachment-related experiences, and thereby                  
              influence their overall quality of child care.  This project will              
              explore: 1) the stability of parents' working models over time,                
              and links between parents' working models and their personality                
              characteristics; 2) how working models forecast particular                     
              patterns of parent-child interactions; and 3) how working models               
              and caregiving patterns affect children's developing social-                   
              emotional competence.  Mothers' and fathers' models of attachment              
              will be assessed using the Adult Attachment Interview prenatally,              
              and when their firstborn is 24-months old.  Measures of both                   
              parents' personality characteristics will be obtained prenatally               
              to see how they relate to their working models.  Caregiving                    
              quality will be assessed by videotaping parent-child interactions              
              when the child is 8 and 24 months old.  Finally, children's                    
              social emotional competence will be examined by assessing                      
              attachment security in infancy and autonomy in problem-solving in              
              toddlerhood.
