Abstract    :
              This award is made in the Office of Special Projects of the                    
              Chemistry Division and the Division of Materials Research under                
              the Materials Synthesis and Processing Initiative.                             
              Dehydrogenative condensation polymerization of silanes will be                 
              studied. The research will focus on learning how to control                    
              polymer growth at the metal center, development of new                         
              catalysts, and application of the new chemistry to produce                     
              functionalized polymers with radically new properties. Hybrid                  
              silicon polymers that contain hydrocarbon unsaturation or                      
              transition metal centers in the polymer backbone will be made.                 
              Dehydrogenative coupling will be extended to other metals such                 
              as stannanes to produce new polymers containing tin-tin bonds.

              Polymers containing redox-active metal centers will provide                    
              access to new conducting polymers, magnetically active                         
              polymers, macromolecular catalysts or electrode mediator                       
              systems.
