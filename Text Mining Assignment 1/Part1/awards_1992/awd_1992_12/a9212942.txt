Abstract    :
              The Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970 (OSHA) regulates                
              conditions in private sector establishments and has been one of the            
              most controversial examples of social regulation of the past two               
              decades.  On the one hand, OSHA has been charged with imposing                 
              needlessly high costs on firms.  On the other hand, the relative               
              stability in the overall incidence of workplace injuries in the                
              last two decades since OSHA's passage suggests that it has had a               
              negligible impact on safety and health in the workplace.  Yet, only            
              a very limited amount of independent, empirical research has been              
              completed to date to link the enforcement efforts of OSHA to health            
              and safety in the workplace.                                                   
                                                                                             
              This project fills an important empirical gap by analyzing the                 
              underlying determinants of OSHA performance.  Specifically, this               
              study draws upon a data set which contains the complete records for            
              inspections conducted by OSHA from 1971 to June of 1991.  The                  
              analysis is pursued in two stages.  First, the study empirically               
              examines the relationship between different levels of enforcement              
              and firm-level compliance with specific health and safety                      
              standards.  Second, it measures the relationship between compliance            
              and health and safety outcomes, such as the incidence of workplace             
              injuries.  In addition to answering a number of questions                      
              concerning the efficacy of current methods of safety and health                
              regulation, it advances general understanding of compliance                    
              behavior in enforcement based regulatory systems.  While analyses              
              to date typically assume perfect compliance with promulgated                   
              regulations, this study tests notions of regulatory performance                
              from the perspective of limited enforcement and imperfect                      
              compliance.
