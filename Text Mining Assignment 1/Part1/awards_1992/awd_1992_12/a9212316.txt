Abstract    :
              This award of $390,000, to the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor,              
              is for the development of an integrated research program on the                
              real-time control of semiconductor manufacturing processes and for             
              the integration of such research into new curricula.  The effort               
              will improve the capabilities of semiconductor manufacturing tools             
              to produce consistent, uniform high-yield wafers through the                   
              application of real-time and run-to-run feedback and feedforward               
              control.  It will also create a new academic program for the                   
              training of advanced undergraduate and graduate students in this               
              important area.
