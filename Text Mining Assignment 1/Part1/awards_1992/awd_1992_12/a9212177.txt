Abstract    :
                   Theoretical research in elementary particle physics will                  
              concentrate on computing the higher-order effects of the                       
              strong nuclear force on processes which occur at existing                      
              particle accelerators, or will occur at future ones of higher                  
              energy.  Knowledge of these effects is very important to our                   
              further testing of the so-called Standard Model of the                         
              elementary particles, and to our efforts to explore physics                    
              beyond that described in this Model.
