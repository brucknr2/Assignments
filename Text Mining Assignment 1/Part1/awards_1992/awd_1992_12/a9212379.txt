Abstract    :
              In this project, supported by the Analytical and Surface                       
              Chemistry Program, Professor Campbell will study ensemble                      
              effects in surface reactions catalyzed by platinum.  The use of                
              bismuth atoms as random, electronically neutral site blockers                  
              allows the determination of the size of the platinum site                      
              necessary for the hydrogenation of cyclohexene and the                         
              dehydrogenation and hydrogenolysis of cyclohexane.  The overall                
              goal of this work is to develop a stepwise kinetic model for                   
              these catalytic reactions on the platinum surface.  This sort                  
              of microscopic information is essential to a detailed                          
              understanding of heterogeneous catalysis.

              The detailed microscopic understanding of the active site for                  
              catalysis of hydrocarbon conversion chemistry on platinum is                   
              important for the design of effective catalysts for use in the                 
              petroleum refining industry.  This research project uses                       
              bismuth atom adsorption methods to probe the active site for                   
              hydrocarbon reactions on model platinum catalysts with a view                  
              to understanding the microscopic details of this heterogeneous                 
              chemistry.
