Abstract    :
              Partial support is requested to purchase a high temperature                    
              vacuum furnace dedicated to the support of engineering. The                    
              equipment will be used for many research projects, which                       
              include, in particular, (1) interfacial phase stability after                  
              extended thermal exposure in SiC/Titanium alloy and SiC/SiC                    
              composite materials; (2) the role of particle size                             
              distributions on the sintering and coarsening of alumina and                   
              tungsten; (2) the phase stability of in-situ titanium/titanium                 
              boride composite materials; (4) the heat treatment of metal                    
              alloys to simulate welding thermal cycles.
