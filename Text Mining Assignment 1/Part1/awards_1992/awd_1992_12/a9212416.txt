Abstract    :
                   This award supports the research of Professor Kadell to work              
              in combinatorics.  Specifically, he will continue his                          
              investigations into the properties of the Selberg-Jack symmetric               
              functions.  This research is part of more general investigations               
              of the theory of orthogonal polynomials.  Moreover, Professor                  
              Kadell is bringing to bear standard algebraic machinery into the               
              study of these combinatorial ideas, thereby placing these                      
              combinatorial results into the general context of algebra.                     
                   The research in the general area of combinatorics.                        
              Combinatorics attempts to find efficient methods to study how                  
              discrete collections can be organized.  The behavior of discrete               
              systems is extremely important to modern communications.  For                  
              example, the design of large networks, as in telephone systems,                
              and the design of algorithms in computer science all deal with                 
              discrete objects, and this make use of combinatorial research.
