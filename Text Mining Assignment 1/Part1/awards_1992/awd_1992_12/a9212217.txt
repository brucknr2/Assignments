Abstract    :
                   Partial financial support is requested for the URSI Commission            
              G International Symposium on "A Decade of Advances in Radiowave                
              Probing of the High-latitude Ionosphere and Atmosphere" to be held             
              at the Geophysical Institute of the University of Alaska Fairbanks             
              from 10-14 August 1992. This symposium is timely to assess what has            
              been learned during the past ten years and to consider the                     
              application and significance of new facilities. Most of the papers             
              will be published in a special issue of Radio Science similar to               
              what was done for the comparable August, 1982 meeting (Radio                   
              Science (18, Nov.-Dec., 1983).
