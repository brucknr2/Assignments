Abstract    :
                   Two years ago the National Science Foundation announced                   
              a number of new programs that support undergraduate computer                   
              science education, including CISE's Educational                                
              Infrastructure Program and EHR's Undergraduate Course and                      
              Curriculum Development Program.  These programs join the                       
              current EHR's undergraduate programs of Instrumentation and                    
              Laboratory Improvement, and Undergraduate Faculty                              
              Enhancement.

              allowance to allow Drs. David Dobkin, Chris Nevison, Juris                     
              Reinfelds and Joe Turner to attend the ACM SIGCSE Technical                    
              Symposium on Computer Science Education in March, 1992 in                      
              order to be members of a panel discussing NSF-funded                           
              curriculum projects.  Dr. David Dobkin will relate his                         
              progress with integrating computer science and the arts at                     
              the undergraduate level.  Chris Nevison will present his                       
              experience over the past years with three NSF educational                      
              programs and the development of parallel processing in the                     
              undergraduate curriculum.  Juris Reinfelds will describe a                     
              combined development effort in computer science and                            
              mathematics for the first two pairs of courses.  The efforts                   
              of Clemson University, Bowdoin College, and the University of                  
              Connecticut to implement the Computing Curriculum '91 in
