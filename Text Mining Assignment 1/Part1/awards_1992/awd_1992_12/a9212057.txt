Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  This is a study of the impact of changes in the spatial                   
              distribution of employment opportunities within urban areas on                 
              minority and youth employment outcomes.  The central focus of the              
              study is to study the extent to which the mismatch between the                 
              location and types of jobs and the location and skills of                      
              potential employees helps explain contemporary black/white                     
              differences in employment.  The study will use data for census                 
              tracts in twelve metropolitan areas in the United States.                      
                   This study is an important addition to the literature on the              
              causes of racial differences in employment rates.  The unique                  
              contribution of the study is that it develops direct measures of               
              employment potentials for small areas (tracts).  This in turn                  
              makes it possible to assess empirically whether the so-called                  
              spatial mismatch hypothesis is correct.  The spatial mismatch                  
              hypothesis suggests that the cause of the low employment rates                 
              for black men in some metropolitan areas in the United States is               
              that they live in areas where there are no jobs available that                 
              match the skills they bring to the labor market.
