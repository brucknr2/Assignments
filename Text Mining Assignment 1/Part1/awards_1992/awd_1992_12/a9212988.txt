Abstract    :
              High temperature Vacuum/Inert Atmosphere furnace and Tensile                   
              gripping fixtures will be purchased and used to study mechanical               
              behavior of advanced metallic, intermetallic, ceramic and                      
              composite materials up to 2000oC.  The research encompasses fiber              
              reinforced ceramic composites, damage processes in glass/ceramic               
              matrix composites, and effect of microstructure and solutes on                 
              tensile and creep deformation of TiAl based alloys.
