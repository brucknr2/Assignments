Abstract    :
              The objectives of the proposed research are 1) to investigate the              
              impact of mermithid parasitism on depression of mayfly host                    
              population size, 2) to investigate the ecological effect and the               
              possible source of parasite induced behavioral alterations of                  
              larval host behavior, and 3) to test that behavioral alterations               
              are caused by, rather than correlated with, parasitic infection.               
              Proposed methodology includes: 1) extensive field sampling to                  
              estimate mermithid prevalence combined with predictive mathematical            
              models; 2) microcosm experiments to a) quantify ecological effects             
              of parasite induced behavioral alterations on larval mayfly                    
              vulnerability to predation from stoneflies and trout, b) infer                 
              possible role of host nutritional stress and physical obstruction              
              of host internal function by parasite in producing the behavioral              
              alterations; and 3) the development of a laboratory culture to                 
              control and monitor parasite development in the larval host.  The              
              key contributions of this research will be 1) an understanding of              
              immediate and long term consequences to host fitness of parasite               
              infections and 2) a consideration of the evolutionary source of                
              behavioral alterations, the importance of side effects of the                  
              infection as mediators of the alterations, and the possible                    
              constraints acting on the evolution of parasite induced behavioral             
              alterations.
