Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  Terror management theory attempts to explain the                          
              psychological functions of self-esteem and cultural worldviews.                
              According to the theory, the individual is protected from anxiety              
              by a dual component cultural anxiety buffer, consisting of (a) a               
              cultural worldview, which includes one's conception of reality,                
              standards of value, and hope of immortality, and (b) self-esteem,              
              or the belief that one is living up to the standards of value                  
              prescribed by the cultural worldview. From this perspective,                   
              one's beliefs about oneself and the world in which one lives                   
              serve the essential defensive function of protecting one from                  
              anxiety. The equanimity-providing concepts are consensually                    
              validated when others share our beliefs and threatened when                    
              others disagree with our beliefs. Because the cultural anxiety-                
              buffer requires continual consensual validation for effective                  
              protection from anxiety, much social behavior is directed toward               
              the validation of its two components.                                          
                                                                                             
                   Research has shown that: (a) reminding people of their                    
              mortality increases the positivity of their reactions to people                
              and ideas that support their worldviews and the negativity of                  
              their reactions to people and ideas that threaten their                        
              worldviews, (b) high levels of self-esteem decrease both anxiety               
              in response to threatening stimuli and defensive distortions that              
              presumably function to reduce one's anxiety, and (c) threats to                
              the cultural worldview increase susceptibility to anxiety in                   
              response to subtle reminders of one's mortality. The goals of                  
              this research are threefold: (1) to investigate the centrality of              
              death concerns to the processes posited by the theory, (2) to add              
              to the evidentiary base for the theory by further assessing both               
              the effects of mortality salience on behavior focused on                       
              bolstering self-esteem and the worldview and the roles of self-                
              esteem and the worldview in allaying death concerns, and (3) to                
              assess the role of affective responses to and awareness of                     
              threatening material in the production of the effects posited by               
              the theory. This research will increase our understanding of why               
              self-esteem is so important and so beneficial for the individual.
