Abstract    :
              Theodosius Dobzhansky (1900-1975) was one of the leading biologists            
              of the 20th century:  a key figure in the evolutionary synthesis of            
              the 1930s and author of its first modern statement (Genetics and               
              the Origin of Species, 1937), he was the founder of modern Western             
              population genetics, the teacher of a large international school,              
              and author of many influential popular books on scientific and                 
              social topics.  Although historians of biology are focussing                   
              increasing attention on his legacy, this ongoing evaluation has                
              been greatly hampered by a lack of information about his formative             
              years.  Dobzhansky left Russia for New York in 1927 to work with               
              American geneticist T. H. Morgan, and never returned.                          
                                                                                             
              Thanks to recent developments in Russia, it has now become                     
              possible, using newly discovered archival materials, to analyze the            
              formative years of Dobzhansky's career.  Under this grant, Dr.                 
              Adams is beginning to survey these archives in preparation for a               
              study of Dobzhansky's formative years, 1900-1937.  Working with                
              young Russian investigators who have been collecting the pertinent             
              materials, Dr. Adams is seeking to clarify the influence of the                
              Kiev school of cytogenetics on Dobzhansky's chromosomal work (1914-            
              1924);  the views of his Petersburg mentor, Filipchenko, on his                
              approach to micro- and macroevolution, and his social views (1924-             
              1927);  the influence of Russian entomological traditions on his               
              approach to populations, species, and field practice; his gradual              
              assimilation of the conventions and practices of the Morgan                    
              laboratory; and the influence of his Russian background on the                 
              writing of his evolutionary classic.  With support from this grant,            
              Dr. Adams and colleagues are beginning to mine the newly opened                
              Russian archives.  This grant provides travel assistance to the PI             
              as well as instrumentation necessary for his Russian collaborators             
              to provide him with the needed documentation.  As a result, sources            
              for the origin of modern population biology will be made available             
              for study in the US.
