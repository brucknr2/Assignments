Abstract    :
              This project provides support for acquisition of laboratory                    
              research equipment for seismic engineering experiments.  The                   
              equipment to be purchased is a moderate speed, one hundred and                 
              four channel data acquisition system, eighty channels for use with             
              strain gages and twenty-four channels for use with load cells and              
              LVDTs.  Increasing testing of larger and more complex structural               
              systems has been conducted at the large scale structural                       
              engineering laboratory at the University of Michigan.  These test              
              structures require more instrumentation in order to completely                 
              interpret their behavior under severe loading conditions.  The                 
              reliable and large capacity data acquisition system acquired will              
              further enhance the capability of large scale seismic testing.                 
                                                                                             
              This is an equipment grant.
