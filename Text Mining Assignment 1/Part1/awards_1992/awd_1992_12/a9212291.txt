Abstract    :
              This project, supported by the Analytical and Surface Chemistry                
              Program, uses unenhanced Raman spectroscopy to probe the                       
              structure and reactivity of adsorbates at solid surfaces.  Both                
              electrochemical surfaces and surfaces characterized in ultra                   
              high vacuum will be investigated in the work to be carried out                 
              here. Technique development to extend the sensitivity of the                   
              method and to address the detection of nontotally symmetric                    
              vibrational modes in the adsorbates will be pursued. In                        
              addition, the work will focus on the characterization of the                   
              polyimide-metal interface.

              The use of unenhanced Raman spectroscopy to characterize the                   
              structure of adsorbed layers at solid surfaces is the focus of                 
              this research project.  Both technique development directed                    
              toward improving the sensitivity and applicability of this                     
              method, as well as direct studies of the polymer-metal                         
              interface make up the research to be carried out here.
