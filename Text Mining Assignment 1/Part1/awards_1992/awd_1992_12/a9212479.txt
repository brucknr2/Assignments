Abstract    :
              A major upgrade of an existing Mossbauer spectrometer is                       
              performed.  Electronics are updated and a controlled                           
              atmosphere, variable-temperature cell with in situ reaction                    
              capability is fabricated; the cell is designed to be placed                    
              between the poles of a 5-inch electromagnet to provide a                       
              magnetic field up to 11 kilogauss.  It is thought that this is                 
              the most versatile Mossbauer facility in the U. S.                             
                                                                                             
              The equipment will be used for several studies in catalysis                    
              and coal chemistry including studies of electronic, magnetic,                  
              and lattice properties of supported metal clusters; active                     
              phases of cobalt and iron catalysts during hydrogenation of                    
              carbon monoxide; surface and bulk characteristics of zeolites                  
              exchanged with iron or cobalt, and their correlation with                      
              activity for decomposition of nitric oxide; transformations of                 
              iron minerals during coal devolatilization, char oxidation,                    
              and the deposition of mineral matter on boiler surfaces; and                   
              iron compounds in fly ash.
