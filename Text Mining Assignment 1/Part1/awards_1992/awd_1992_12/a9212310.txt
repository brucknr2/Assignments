Abstract    :
              This award, of $390,000, is for the development of a dynamic                   
              curriculum for opto-electronics and communication by training                  
              senior undergraduate and first-level graduate students in photonic             
              areas.  The existing photonic engineering courses will be                      
              restructured, with an emphasis on hands-on laboratory work, problem            
              solving, systems design and testing, computer-aided analysis and               
              design, and information exchange on newly developed photonic                   
              topics.  The program will strengthen the follow-up independent                 
              study course and the summer research project.  Students will                   
              participate in active research environments by measuring,                      
              analyzing, and attacking state-of-the art problems with a                      
              purposeful experience to encourage young engineers in their                    
              professional growth.
