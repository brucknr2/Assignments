Abstract    :
              The work described in this proposal will result in                             
              the development of a comprehensive robust control                              
              theory and design methodology for power                                        
              conversion systems.  This will be the first time that                          
              robust control techniques will be applied techniques                           
              will be applied to feedback design of power                                    
              conversion systems with the resulting benefits of                              
              more reliable, less costly converter designs.  The                             
              work is broadly divided into the two related areas                             
              of analysis and synthesis of power conversion                                  
              feedback systems.  For analysis we will identify and                           
              implement algorithms for the computation of u, the                             
              structured singular value.  This will then allow the                           
              assessment of robust stability and robust                                      
              performance; that is, determination will be made                               
              whether stability and performance criteria are                                 
              satisfied despite variations or uncertainties in                               
              operating conditions/parameters away from the                                  
              nominal.  Furthermore, the work will result in the                             
              development of robust controller design                                        
              methodologies for power conversion systems.                                    
              These methodologies will be given both single                                  
              output converters and for multi-output and multiple                            
              interconnected converter systems.
