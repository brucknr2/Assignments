Abstract    :
                   A multi-processor platform will be used for the development               
              of an insitu intelligent materials processing system.  This system             
              includes data acquisition, analysis and control of advanced                    
              material processing that can be conducted in real-time as the                  
              process is running.  This equipment will be dedicated to support               
              research in advancing several material processing problems                     
              including:  (1) composition and structure control for laminated                
              coatings, (2) real-time control for chemical vapor deposition                  
              processing, and (3) automated inspection of coatings.  All these               
              projects take a multi-disciplinary approach in developing a                    
              fundamental understanding and control of the principal phenomena               
              of manufacturing and structure/property correlations which would               
              assist in the engineering and development of new and novel                     
              materials capabilities.                                                        
                   There is an urgent need in all segments of technology and                 
              industry for new and advanced materials.  Custom tailoring of                  
              materials provides exciting new capabilities for all applications              
              from advanced electronic devices to new structural materials.  A               
              major barrier to wide-spread use of this approach has been the                 
              difficulties in utilizing all the data and processing information              
              needed to design and fabricate these materials.  An intelligent                
              materials processing capability will significantly aid the                     
              materials engineer in achieving these objectives.
