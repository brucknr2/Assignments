Abstract    :
                   It is typically quite difficult to predict the properties of              
              injection molded, fiber-reinforced parts.  A major part of the                 
              difficulty involves an inability to accurately predict the                     
              orientation of the fibers in the finished part.  The research will             
              provide the scientific basis for predictions of the flow-induced               
              structure and properties of fiber composites.  The project will                
              provide a firm basis for qualitative engineering judgments about               
              the effects of factors such as fiber concentration and aspect                  
              ratio, mold geometry, filling pressure and fluid                               
              rheology on fiber orientation and composite properties.                        
                   The results obtained from the research will guide the                     
              development of computer-aided design/computer-aided manufacturing              
              (CAD/CAM) software for the processing of fiber composites by                   
              injection and compression molding.
