Abstract    :
              9212906  Singer    This award provides funds to permit Dr. Sherwin  J. Singer,
              Department of Chemistry, Ohio State  University, to pursue with Dr. Sungyul
              Lee,  Professor of Chemistry, Kyunghee University,  Korea, for 24 months, a
              program of cooperative  research on the electronic structure in dynamic 
              environments - clusters and condensed phases.   These collaborators will study
              solvated metal  atoms in rare gas clusters and will perform mixed 
              quantum/classical theoretical calculations on  these systems.  They hope to
              stimulate further  overlap between theory and experiments on  clusters.    The
              proposed research is part of a broad effort  combining quantum chemical and
              condensed phase  simulation techniques.  The U.S. and Korean  collaborators are
              highly respected scientists  with proven ability in the field of this 
              research.  Under this project, Dr. Lee will make  extended visits for
              cooperative research in Dr.  Singer's laboratory.  This project is relevant to 
              the objectives of the U.S.-Korea Cooperative  Science Program which seeks to
              increase the level  of cooperation between U.S. and Korean scientists  and
              engineers through the exchange of scientific  information, ideas, skills, and
              techniques and  through collaboration on problems of mutual  benefit.  Korean
              participation in the project is  supported by the Korea Science and Engineering
               Foundation (KOSEF).  This project adds an  international cooperative dimension
              to the PI's  research under NSF Grant No. CHE-9115615.  ***
