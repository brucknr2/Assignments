Abstract    :
              Recent published results show that fractal geometry can be                     
              effectively used to model the skewness and degree of self-                     
              similarity exhibited by the memory-access patterns generated                   
              by processors.  The fact that the fractal model can be used to                 
              predict the behavior of programs at many levels of the memory                  
              hierarchy, and that the performance of those levels can be in                  
              turn predicted, implies that memory access patterns are highly                 
              structured.                                                                    
                                                                                             
              Unfortunately, this structure is also highly irregular, and                    
              the vast majority of models that have been proposed to                         
              simulate program behavior must rely on over-simplifying and                    
              unrealistic assumptions of uniformity of access and/or of                      
              independence of access.  Some preliminary results show that                    
              under some conditions, in particular when a process is                         
              allocated too little cache storage, its memory access pattern                  
              results in chaos in the cache, yielding poor cache                             
              performance.                                                                   
                                                                                             
              This research investigates the conditions under which chaos                    
              occurs, how cache design parameters influence it, how chaotic                  
              behavior influences cache performance, and applies these                       
              results to threading and cache partitioning, two methodologies                 
              that present potentially favorable conditions for chaos to                     
              appear.
