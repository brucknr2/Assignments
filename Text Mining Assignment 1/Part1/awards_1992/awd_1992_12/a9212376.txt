Abstract    :
              The Coordinated Science Laboratory at the University of Illinois-              
              Champaign will purchase equipment to support research in real-                 
              time vision based adaptive control of robotic manipulators. The                
              equipment, consisting of a camera, vision system, and computer                 
              workstation, will be interfaced to a direct-drive manipulator for              
              use in research projects aimed at improving the robustness of                  
              adaptive robot control. The project will seek to quantify,                     
              through theoretical and experimental investigation of adaptive                 
              robot control, various instability phenomena that may arise in                 
              real-time adaptive vision feedback as a result of external                     
              disturbances and unmodeled dynamics. Among the phenomena to be                 
              studied are slow parameter drift instabilities, fast adaptation                
              instabilities, bursting, and more. The ultimate goal is to  make               
              adaptive control of robots highly robust and therefore practical               
              from an engineering standpoint.***     //
