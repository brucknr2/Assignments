Abstract    :
              This is an award to support research to find                                   
              a strategy for describing the reduction                                        
              kinetics of organic substrates in natural                                      
              environments that is both rigorously                                           
              deterministic in theory as well as being                                       
              amenable to practical application.  The                                        
              approach will be to treat the substance                                        
              directly responsible for the reduction of                                      
              organic pollutants as electron-transfer                                        
              mediators that are present at low steady-                                      
              state concentration and can be assayed by                                      
              their rate of reaction with selective probe                                    
              compounds.  The first part of this project                                     
              will be to identify suitable probe compounds                                   
              for likely reduction mediators, and to verify                                  
              that these techniques can be used in natural                                   
              media.  Later, the most promising probe                                        
              technique will be applied to show that the                                     
              mediator to which the probe technique                                          
              responds is, in fact, contributing to                                          
              reduction in environmental systems.  Finally,                                  
              the utility of the whole approach for                                          
              predicting the rate of specific reduction                                      
              reactions of organic pollutants in the                                         
              environment will be demonstrated.  The                                         
              proposal leading to this award was submitted                                   
              in response to NSF 88-99 as modified by

              changes in NSF 83-57 and published as NSF 90-                                  
              77.                                                                            
                                                                                             
              Despite recent research on the reduction                                       
              reactions of organic pollutants in anaerobic                                   
              sediments, soils, and groundwaters, it is not                                  
              yet possible to quantitatively predict the                                     
              rates of any of these transformations.  This                                   
              severely restricts the consideration of                                        
              reduction processes in regulatory decision-                                    
              making and contributes to the unreliability                                    
              of remediation technologies that rely on                                       
              these reactions.  If this research proves to                                   
              be as successful as it was for describing the                                  
              kinetics of photooxidation in sunlit surface                                   
              water, it is likely to influence the way most                                  
              research on the kinetics of reduction                                          
              reactions in anaerobic environmental systems                                   
              is done in the future.  Results of this                                        
              research are likely to be applied to                                           
              engineering design of processes and systems                                    
              for decontamination of soils and groundwater.
