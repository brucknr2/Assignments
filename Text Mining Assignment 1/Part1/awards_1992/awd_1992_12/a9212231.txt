Abstract    :
                   This work addresses theoretical nuclear structure issues.                 
              It will use a theoretical model based on the symplectic group to               
              study the microscopic origin of nuclear collective motions.  the               
              proposed explicit evaluation of tensor operator matrix elements                
              can be useful in many areas of physics.
