              International Symposium on Probability and Its Applications".                  
              The conference will be held from 18 to 21 March 1993, in                       
              Bloomington, Indiana.  The purpose of this Symposium is to focus               
              special attention on some of the more prominent directions in                  
              probability and its applications.  The symposium's objectives                  
              include:

                   among probability researchers through-out a large                         
                   interdisciplinary community;                                              
                   2.  Presenting recent research developments and facilitating              
                   prioritization of future directions;                                      
                   3.  Apprising non-specialists, young researchers and                      
                   graduate students of the most active areas in probability                 
                   research.
