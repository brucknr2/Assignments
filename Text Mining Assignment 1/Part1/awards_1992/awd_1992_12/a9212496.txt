Abstract    :
              This study is part of a joint NSF/EPRI Program on Advanced                     
              Polymeric Materials.  The tribological properties of novel                     
              fluorinated ultra-thin films will be investigated.  The films are              
              composed of molecules which are designed to spontaneously absorb               
              to solid surfaces, self-assemble, and anchor as monolayers.  The               
              polymer architectures combine amphilic structures which self-                  
              organic as monomers, produce highly ordered polymeric Langmuir-                
              Blodgett films, and incorporate mobility and assembly via                      
              flexible linkages.  Thin film chemistry will use a flexible, low               
              surface energy siloxane backbone, which has been derivatized with              
              self-assembling, terminally functionalized, long hydrocarbon                   
              alkyl chains for surface chemisorption, as well as mobile                      
              perfluoroalky side chains for enhanced friction properties.
