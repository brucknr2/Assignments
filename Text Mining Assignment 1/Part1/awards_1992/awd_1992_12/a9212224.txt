Abstract    :
                   This award is for the purchase of a two-axis rotary table that            
              will be installed on a three-axis vertical milling machine, giving             
              the machine tool a total of five Computer Numerical Control (CNC)              
              axis.  This degree of complexity will enable the researchers to                
              evaluate several research projects, currently in progress, in a                
              real world mode of operation.  All these research efforts are aimed            
              at enhancing the accuracy capability of complex-contour machining              
              by developing new and improved interpolators and servo-system                  
              architecture.  The equipment is also intended to be used for                   
              undergraduate education, specifically in the area of "Computer                 
              Control of Manufacturing Systems."                                             
                   Enhancing the accuracy of contour machining of complex                    
              surfaces is of major significance to wide variety of manufacturing             
              industries for the purpose of improving the performance of their               
              products.  This work is also of great significance to the domestic             
              industry from a competitive perspective.
