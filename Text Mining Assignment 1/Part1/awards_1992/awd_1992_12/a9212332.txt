Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The fact that the United States has been surprised by the force of             
              nationalism in destroying countries such as the Soviet Union and               
              Yugoslavia shows that our assumptions and theories  about                      
              nationalism and ethnicism have serious flaws.  The countries of the            
              former Soviet Union remain ethnically very divided and the                     
              conseqences of these divisions are only recently being appreciated.            
                                                                                             
              In this research investigation, a leading comparative politics area            
              specialist and a leading theorist on nationalism are jointly                   
              examining the most complex and least understood of the ethnic                  
              issues - - language use and assimilation - - in six of the new                 
              countries of the former Soviet Union.  Using both sociological and             
              anthropological methods, the investigation not only aims at                    
              contributing to our understanding of this crucial area of the                  
              world, but also to the improvement of our theories of language use             
              and assimilation and the general factors that determine whether                
              language politics does or does not lead to conflict.  Given the                
              total lack of correspondence between country boundaries and ethnic             
              boundaries in the Third World, this is a central question for our              
              understanding of politics and democratization in the former Soviet             
              Union.
