Abstract    :
                   Past instrumental and proxy records of climate are relatively             
              scarce for the middle to high latitudes of the Southern Hemisphere.            
              Yet this highly oceanic region is a key to larger-scale climatic               
              change, in ways that are fundamentally different from comparable               
              northern latitudes.  Climatically-sensitive, absolutely-dated                  
              annual tree-ring chronologies have been developed for time-spans               
              ranging from recent centuries to the past millennium for the three             
              forested land areas at southern middle latitudes:  Tierra del                  
              Fuego, Tasmania and New Zealand.  However this data has yet to be              
              fully exploited in large-scale studies of climate change.  Prior               
              research has demonstrated the value of using tree-ring data as                 
              indicators of past atmosphere-ocean interaction at sites around the            
              globe.  This award supports the utilization of these southern tree-            
              ring records to model and reconstruct indices of atmospheric and               
              oceanic parameters of climatic variability in the subantarctic                 
              sector.  These new data will allow us to evaluate the Little Ice               
              Age and Medieval Warm Epoch at these latitudes, and how recent and             
              possible future greenhouse warming relates to past patterns of                 
              natural climate variability for this part of the Southern                      
              Hemisphere.
