Abstract    :
              The implementation phase of STEP is beginning to take shape on a               
              wide international scale.  Satellites AKEBONO, SOLAR-A, and UARS               
              are in orbit, and major national programs, such as CANOPUS                     
              (Canada) and CEDAR, GEM, MAX-91 (USA) are in place.  Community                 
              services such as the US STEP Newsletter and Japan's STEP                       
              Simulation Promotion Office are beginning to play a crucial role               
              in communications and scholarly exchange.  Recognizing the                     
              importance of STEP and the need to assure participation of all                 
              space missions, the International Council of Scientific Unions                 
              recently extended the formal duration of STEP until 1997.  In                  
              view of the increased demands for international coordination, and              
              to assure continuity of the operations, the Bureau of the                      
              Scientific Committee of Solar-Terrestrial Physics recently                     
              appointed the Principal Investigator to another year in his                    
              functions as the International STEP Coordinator.  Support is                   
              requested to enable the PI to continue his tasks in that                       
              capacity.  His continued participation will be of benefit to the               
              STEP scientists in the United States, because through his office,              
              a close link to the international STEP-related information and                 
              activities will be assured.
