Abstract    :
                   Cadmium electroplating in cyanide baths is of significant                 
              environmental concern.  In addition, by-products of cadmium                    
              coatings release toxic substances in the environment during their              
              use and disposal.  As a consequence, a unique, environmentally and             
              occupationally safe dry plating concept has been developed.                    
                   The dry plating concept utilizes a novel plasma assisted vapor            
              deposition process and an in situ reclaim technique for cadmium.               
              This dry plating is economical for coating and waste management.
