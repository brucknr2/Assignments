Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              During the last week of October, 1991, Hog Island of the Virginia              
              Coast Reserve LTER site was overwashed with sea water from the                 
              combined effects of three weather systems.  The relatively low                 
              relief of the island contributed to ca. 75% of the island being                
              inundated.  There was a tremendous increase in salinity (a                     
              substantial freshwater lens underlying the island now is 22 ppt                
              saline).  This situation presents a unique opportunity to examine              
              storm-induced changes in the ecosystem that may not happen again               
              for several decades.  Specifically, this project will study the                
              impact of these storms on the dominant woody species of the                    
              islands, Myrica cerifera (wax myrtle).  Myrica is an "impact"                  
              species, either directly or indirectly affecting many terrestrial              
              ecological processes on the islands, from island stability, to                 
              nitrogen availability (it is a N fixer), to bird nesting.  A                   
              series of field measurements will be conducted to examine                      
              patterns of Myrica establishment, mortality, and production as                 
              related to variations in groundwater salinity and subtle changes               
              in elevation.
