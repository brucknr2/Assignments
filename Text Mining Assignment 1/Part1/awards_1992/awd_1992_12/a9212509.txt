Abstract    :
              The project will organize, convene                                             
              and report on a workshop on the                                                
              effects of the April 22, 1991 Costa                                            
              Rica earthquake.  This earthquake                                              
              presents an unique opportunity to                                              
              study the performance of structures

              study and identify analysis,
