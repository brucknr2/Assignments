Abstract    :
              This proposal has two stated objectives.  One was to examine the               
              microstructural development during solidification of a ceramic                 
              material in which more than one phase adopts a faceted morphology.             
              A four component silicate system of silica-magnesia-alumina-calcia             
              (SMAC) was selected for this study.  The second objective was to               
              gain a better understanding of the visual representation of                    
              multicomponent system with a previously developed computer aided               
              design (CAD) program.                                                          
              %%%%                                                                           
              This proposal studies the microstructural development during                   
              directional solidification.  The floating zone technique will be               
              employed.  A previously developed computer aided design (CAD)                  
              program will be modified to handle systems with components greater             
              than 4.  This study will bring better understandings of phase                  
              equlibria and the morphological development during the                         
              solidification.
