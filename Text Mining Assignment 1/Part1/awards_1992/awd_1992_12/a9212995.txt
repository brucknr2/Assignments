Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This project will study the effects of plant species diversity on              
              the cycling of nitrogen and phosphorus in a restored California                
              serpentine grassland.  Native forbs and grasses from four                      
              functional groups that differ in phenology, C/N ratio, rooting                 
              depth, root-to-shoot ratio, and other characteristics relevant to              
              nutrient cycling will be used.  Plots will be planted with                     
              different compositions and diversities of these functional groups              
              to test five hypotheses: 1) Differences in plant phenology and                 
              associated functional characteristics result in different patterns             
              of nutrient turnover and retention in plots composed of separate               
              functional groups; 2) Increasing diversity causes an increased                 
              importance of plant uptake relative to microbial immobilization;               
              alternatively, it results in decreased nutrient loss from the                  
              system; 3) Increases in functional group diversity result in                   
              decreased seasonal variability in nutrient availability; 4)                    
              Maximum rates of nutrient turnover do not increase with increasing             
              diversity; and 5) Below-ground litter turnover and diversity in                
              below-ground plant functional characteristics have greater effects             
              on nutrient dynamics than does above-ground litter.
