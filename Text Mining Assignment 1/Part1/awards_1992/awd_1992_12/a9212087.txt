Abstract    :
              A machine's physical memory is a resource for which many                       
              subsystems, including databases, persistent object storage                     
              managers, and multimedia file systems, are potential competitors.              
              As memory size grows, optimizing the diverse uses of physical                  
              memory will require diverse management policies. These policies                
              must, however, coexist, and the claims on memory for different                 
              uses must be balanced. This research investigates a system                     
              architecture for balancing the requirements of memory competitors,             
              while allowing a greater variety of management policies to be                  
              implemented.  The system architecture permits pageout daemons                  
              situated outside the kernel to control pools of physical memory.               
              This allows subsystems such as databases much greater control over             
              memory management policy.  A balance manager within the kernel                 
              controls the size of these pools.  A simulator is used to explore              
              the interactions of management policies, while a prototype system,             
              supported by an extended version of Mach 3.0, allows the                       
              experimental validation of the simulation results. Successful                  
              completion of this project will provide a framework for managing               
              large physical memories in future machines.  Using the balancing               
              strategies identified in this research, subsystems for memory-                 
              intensive application will be more readily developed and installed             
              on new machines without ad hoc performance tuning.
