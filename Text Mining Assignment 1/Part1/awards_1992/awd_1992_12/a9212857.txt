Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Dissertation student: Douglas Hemken; Topic:  "Farmers, Scientists,            
              and Boundary Work:  The Origins of Agricultural Science"                       
                                                                                             
              Mr. Hemken, under the direction of Dr. Kloppenburg, is undertaking             
              an historical study of the variation in farmers' and scientists'               
              conceptualization of `science' and its relationship to agriculture.            
              In US history, agricultural research and agricultural improvement              
              went through far-reaching social transformations.  As experiments              
              and improvements ceased to be the province of individual farmers               
              and instead became the product of professional researchers employed            
              by state and federal governments, the manner in which `science' was            
              defined was crucial in justifying transformations.  Drawing upon               
              agricultural periodicals, agricultural society transactions, state             
              experiment station reports, and US Department of Agriculture                   
              publications, this study traces how `science' and `farming' were               
              characterized, and how these characterizations were used to                    
              establish social boundaries and scientific institutions.
