Abstract    :
              The Departments of Civil Engineering, Mechanical Engineering and               
              Physics at the University of Vermont will purchase a YAG laser and             
              an 8-channel signal processor module which will be used to support             
              research in engineering.  The equipment will be used for several               
              research projects including, in particular: smart structures,                  
              mechanical instrumentation, laser-based ultrasonics, and                       
              vibrations.
