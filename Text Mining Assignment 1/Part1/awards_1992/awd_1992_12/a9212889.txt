Abstract    :
                   The Summer Mathematics Institute for Minority Students is a               
              six-week residential summer institute which each year will                     
              accommodate approximately 30-36 minority undergraduates from the               
              United States and Puerto Rico.  Each student participant will                  
              have completed two or more years of collegiate mathematics with                
              distinction.  The students will participate in two intensive                   
              seminars, chosen from at least four offered, which have been                   
              designed to enable them to explore a mathematical topic in depth               
              and to experience the excitement of creating mathematics.  A                   
              principal emphasis common to all seminars is helping students to               
              develop increased fluency with mathematical language, both                     
              written and oral.  The overall goal is to help the students make               
              important transitions:  from learning algorithms to creating                   
              algorithms, from learning definitions to recognizing the salient               
              features of a mathematical landscape and creating definitions,                 
              from learning particular theorems and topics to exploiting the                 
              power of mathematical interconnectivity--that is, from learning                
              mathematics to doing mathematics.  The Institutes will be                      
              operated as a four-way joint project of the Departments of                     
              Mathematics at the University of California, Berkeley and the                  
              University of Texas at Austin, the Professional Development                    
              Program at the University of California, Berkeley, and the Dana                
              Center for Mathematics and Science Education at the University of              
              Texas at Austin.                                                               
                   The Institutes will be held in alternate years at the                     
              University of California, Berkeley and the University of Texas at              
              Austin and will build on successful institutes held in 1989,                   
              1990, and 1991.  The Summer Institutes are conceived as part of a              
              national strategy aimed at increasing the participation of                     
              historically under-represented minorities in mathematics and                   
              mathematics-dependent professions.  The primary goal is to                     
              increase substantially the number of minority undergraduates                   
              pursuing careers in mathematics.
