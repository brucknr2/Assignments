Abstract    :
              The objective of this project is to                                            
              further develop a new technology                                               
              based on the directed modification                                             
              of bacterial surfaces.  The                                                    
              properties of cellular surfaces are                                            
              determined to a large extent by the                                            
              presence of externally exposed                                                 
              receptors and enzymes.  Until now,                                             
              it has not been possible to localize                                           
              proteins on the bacterial surface.                                             
              Recently, the Principal                                                        
              Investigators (PIs) have                                                       
              demonstrated that enzymatically                                                
              active recombinant proteins can be                                             
              anchored on the surface of E. coli                                             
              and other gram negative bacteria.                                              
              This opens the way for numerous                                                
              biotechnology applications                                                     
              including:  (i) Generation of                                                  
              inexpensive cellular adsorbents                                                
              consisting of cells coated with                                                
              recombinant receptors; (ii)                                                    
              Production of new microbial

              expressing surface anchored enzymes                                            
              for use in lieu of immobilized                                                 
              enzyme particles; and (iii)

              suitable for the selection of                                                  
              antibodies with desired properties.
