Abstract    :
              With support from the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program,                 
              Professor Ziegler is developing and using novel Raman                          
              spectroscopic techniques to investigate the dynamics of                        
              photodissociation processes in small polyatomic molecules at a                 
              resolution sufficient to examine individual rotational-                        
              vibrational levels.  Previously developed rotational resonance                 
              Raman techniques are being used to measure rovibrational                       
              quantum specific lifetimes of short-lived (20 femtoseconds to 5                
              picoseconds) quasi-bound excited state levels.  Resonance                      
              hyper-Raman is extending the work to dissociative molecular                    
              excited states in the vuv accessible via two-photon processes                  
              with near-uv photons.  Planned work also includes the use of                   
              resonant Coherent Anti-Stokes Raman Spectroscopy (CARS) to                     
              achieve greater rotational quantum resolution and allow the                    
              study of larger molecules.                                                     
              %%%                                                                            
              In order to control and predict the course of chemical                         
              reactions, one must understand the dynamics of reactions on a                  
              molecular level as a function of both space and time.  This                    
              experimental and theoretical study will focus on expanding our                 
              detailed understanding of the process of photodissociation,                    
              that is, the breaking apart of a molecule after the absorption                 
              of light.  In this work the photodissociation process will be                  
              examined in several cases for the dependence of the outcome on                 
              the initial energy state of the absorbing species.
