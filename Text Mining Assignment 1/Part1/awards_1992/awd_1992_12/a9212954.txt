Abstract    :
              Single species are often envisioned as relatively uniform entities             
              that occupy a single "niche."  Recently, however, ecologists have              
              discovered that single species can consist of multiple specialists             
              that occupy different niches.  Furthermore, ecological diversity               
              within species can be heavily influenced by other species in the               
              community.  The PIs will investigate this important subject in                 
              pumpkinseed sunfish (Lepomis gibbosus), whose geographical range               
              partially overlaps with the bluegill sunfish (Lepomis                          
              machrochirus).  Where they coexist, bluegill are ecological                    
              generalists that often feed on zooplankton, while pumpkinseed are              
              ecological specialists that feed primarily on snails.  In lakes                
              without bluegill, however, pumpkinseeds exist as two morphological             
              forms, one of which feeds on zooplankton.  Thus, the ecological                
              diversity that exists between species in areas of sympatry is                  
              replaced by a comparable degree of ecological diversity that exists            
              within species in allopatry.  From the standpoint of basic science,            
              the proposed research addresses fundamental questions involving                
              coevolution, adaptive radiations, phenotypic plasticity, and                   
              speciation.  The research will also have practical implications,               
              especially by showing that intraspecific variation cannot be                   
              ignored in studies of biodiversity.
