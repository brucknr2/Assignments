Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                                                                                            
              This is a study of methane oxidation in marine sediments and in the            
              water column.  The PI will focus on samples from the Black Sea                 
              Expedition, samples from a forthcoming cruise to Australian coastal            
              waters, and on chemostat experiments in the Laboratory using                   
              sediments from Scan Bay, Alaska. Stable carbon and hydrogen                    
              isotopes will be measured to provide an estimate of the presence               
              and the extent of anaerobic methane oxidation.  The chemostat                  
              experiments will lead to an understanding of the substrates and the            
              mechanisms involved in this oxidation process.
