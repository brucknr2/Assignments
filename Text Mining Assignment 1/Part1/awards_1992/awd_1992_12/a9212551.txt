Abstract    :
              The Department of Aerospace and Mechanical Engineering at the                  
              University of Arizona will purchase an HP 3566A PC Spectrum                    
              Analyzer which will be dedicated to support research in                        
              engineering. The equipment will be used for several research                   
              projects, including in particular the development of a real time               
              active chatter controller. It is proposed to develop both                      
              analytically and in hardware the necessary techniques for the                  
              real time control of machine tool chatter and to implement this                
              system in a manner that allows for integration into existing CNC               
              machine tools. To accomplish this objective, research will focus               
              on development of techniques for real time identification of the               
              transfer function between the cutting tool and the workpiece for               
              a variety of metal working machines as the machine tool operates               
              in the fully developed chatter regime. Development of an adaptive              
              closed-loop control strategy (based on the data provided by the                
              real time system identification technique) for minimizing the                  
              motion between the cutting tool and the workpiece. Initial                     
              research will focus on lathe chatter with the extension to a more              
              broad class of machine tools, including (but not limited to)                   
              milling machines and surface grinders, in the future.***    //
