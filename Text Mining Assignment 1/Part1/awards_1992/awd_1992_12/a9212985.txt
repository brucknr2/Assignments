Abstract    :
              This equipment will be used for                                                
              several research projects, and will                                            
              aid in the analysis of proteins and                                            
              organic acids.  The research                                                   
              projects include light scattering                                              
              studies on protein folding and                                                 
              aggregation, effects of downstream                                             
              processing conditions on protein                                               
              conformation and enzyme activity                                               
              changes, and novel separations for                                             
              protein fractionation and                                                      
              purification.  Each of these                                                   
              projects require rapid and accurate                                            
              analyses of the protein solution or                                            
              fermentation broth samples.
