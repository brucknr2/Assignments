Abstract    :
                   Real-time, computationally intensive, graphical methods for               
              regression are the focus of this research.  In particular, it                  
              will emphasize the theoretical statistical foundations and the                 
              implications of standard displays such as the family of plots                  
              based on residuals for a broad class of peri-parametric models                 
              including generalized linear models.  One goal of this research                
              is to develop a purely graphical analysis with model assessment                
              methods that do not originate in residuals.  These developments                
              will be available as extensions of the LISP-based computing                    
              environment XLISP-STAT.                                                        
                   Graphical displays of quantitative data are a central tool                
              of scientific inquiry.  Although these have historically been                  
              limited to whatever could be presented on a two-dimensional sheet              
              of paper, computing technology now routinely allows three-                     
              dimensional graphical displays.  How to make effective and                     
              technically valid scientific use of this technology needs careful              
              thought and a logical treatment.  In turn, this should result in               
              both a better understanding of standard displays and the                       
              construction of still more effective ones.
