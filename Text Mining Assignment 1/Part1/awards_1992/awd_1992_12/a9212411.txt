Abstract    :
                   This research addresses a series of problems arising in                   
              industry, in geophysics  and in statistics; all require intensive              
              computational efforts and most have a strong geometric aspect.                 
              Whether the topic is geometric work associated with the design of              
              molecules, the timing of folding and magnetization of the earth                
              or dynamical systems of fractals, the emphasis and the novelty                 
              will be found in the formulation of the problems.  The methods of              
              attack will draw on computational mathematics, as in the                       
              computation of fractal dimensions and the fractal pursuit index.               
                   Access to affordable computing means that "solutions" for                 
              practical problems can be found.  More than ever before, the                   
              important step is that of expressing the problem precisely and                 
              correctly in mathematical terms in order to execute correct                    
              computations.  This means capturing the scientific essence of the              
              problem, which is not always what it at first appears to be.                   
              Then, with careful selection of mathematical and computational                 
              methods, simulation and other procedures can yield good working                
              solutions or even exact ones.
