Abstract    :
                   Support is requested for a two-year study of seed dispersal                
                                                                                            
              and seedling establishment in abandoned pastures in the                        
              Chacocente Dry Forest Preserve in southwest Nicaragua.  The                    
              abundance, richness, diversity, species composition, and other                 
              ecological traits of the seed rain, soil seed bank, seed                       
              germination, and seedling and sapling assemblages in abandoned                 
              pastures will be evaluated against the distribution of those                   
              characteristics in nearby intact forest. Rarefaction and                       
              simulation techniques will be used to generate the appropriate                 
              null distributions for the comparisons.  Results of the proposed               
                                                                                             
              research will (1) enhance our understanding of the natural                     
              constraints to dispersal and establishment of forest species in                
              abandoned pastures; (2) contribute to our ability to predict                   
              patterns of regeneration based on source assemblages; and (3)                  
              provide critical information required for efforts to accelerate                
              or enrich the restoration of tropical forest vegetation.
