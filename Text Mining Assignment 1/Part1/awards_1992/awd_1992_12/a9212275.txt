Abstract    :
              This project addresses advanced materials known as                             
              polyphosphazenes, and their design and synthesis.  These                       
              electrically conductive polymers could be used in energy storage               
              devices and lightweight rechargeable batteries.  Material                      
              characterization (glass transition temperature, adhesion to                    
              metals and dimensional stability) as well as ionic conductivities              
              will be evaluated.  In addition, molecular characterization,                   
              including gel permation chromotography, and Fourier Transform                  
              infrared spectroscopy will be conducted to identify molecular                  
              weights and distributions and side groups respectively.  To                    
              examine the interaction of a polymeric electrolyte and an                      
              electrode metal, and between the traces of water in electrolyte                
              and the electrode, preliminary experiments will be conducted                   
              using electron microscopy techniques.  These interactions are a                
              deciding factor in limiting the lifetimes of batteries over many               
              cycles of charge and discharge.
