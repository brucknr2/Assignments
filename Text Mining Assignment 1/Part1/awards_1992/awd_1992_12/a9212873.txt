Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Belowground carbon allocation in forests is poorly understood.                 
              Biomass production, root respiration and carbohydrate storage have             
              often been quantified in recent years, but the factors controlling             
              these processes remain unclear.  This project will do a                        
              comprehensive examination of control and fertilized red pine                   
              (Pinus resinosa Ait.) root systems, in order to determine how                  
              climate and nutrients influence belowground carbon allocation By               
              combining information on changes in in situ root respiration,                  
              total soil respiration, root starch and N concentrations, root                 
              growth and climate factors over time, they will construct yearly               
              belowground carbon budgets for control and fertilized red pine in              
              northern Wisconsin.  They study will complement a similar study of             
              slash pine in Florida and will be compared to predictions from                 
              total soil respiration and ecosystem process models.
