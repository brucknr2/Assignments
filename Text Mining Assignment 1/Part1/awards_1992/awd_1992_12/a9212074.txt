Abstract    :
                 Updates are essential in database applications that require                 
              reasoning under dynamic situations. The objective of the project               
              is to enhance current database systems with strong capabilities                
              ofmodeling and processing changes. An update calculus and an                   
              update algebra have been developed for specifying dynamic                      
              queries, and have been shown to be equivalent to each other. This              
              project investigates algorithms for optimization and efficient                 
              evaluation of dynamic queries. Hypothetical queries are a special              
              case in which new databases after updates are not needed for                   
              answers.  Transformations of these queries into static ones are                
              explored in order to take advantage of existing querying                       
              technology. This project also pursues simplification and                       
              inference techniques for consistency checking so that data                     
              integrity can be preserved after updates. Results of the project               
              will extend database technology to a wider class of applications               
              that exhibit complex dynamic behavior.
