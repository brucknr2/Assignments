Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This Americas Program award will support                                       
              Professor James J. Kolata of the University of                                 
              Notre Dame, Indiana, in a research                                             
              collaboration with Professors Eli Aguilar and                                  
              Enrique Martinez of the Mexican Nuclear                                        
              Research Center (ININ).  The proposed research                                 
              will study details of fusion mechanisms in the                                 
              reaction of atomic nuclei.  The goal of the                                    
              research is to achieve a basic understanding of                                
              heavy-ion fusion, a process in which the                                       
              constituent protons and neutrons of two                                        
              reacting atomic nuclei drastically re-arrange                                  
              to form a compound nucleus.  Sub-barrier fusion                                
              is now known to be stronger than what was                                      
              expected on the basis of simple theoretical                                    
              models of these processes.  Several                                            
              explanations have been put forward to explain                                  
              this discrepancy but further study is needed to                                
              understand this phenomenon.                                                    
                                                                                             
              The proposed collaboration is an extension of                                  
              previous mutually beneficial projects involving                                
              staff members of the Mexican Research Center.                                  
              The data analysis phase of the work will be                                    
              carried out primarily in Mexico while the Notre                                
              Dame group will bring to the collaboration its                                 
              expertise in heavy-ion physics and sub-barrier                                 
              fusion.
