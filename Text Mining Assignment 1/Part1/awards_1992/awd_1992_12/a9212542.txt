Abstract    :
              Narrow dietary specialization in phytophagous insects has been                 
              hypothesized to evolve as a response to hostplant allelochemistry              
              for nearly three decades, but recent investigations have questioned            
              this hypothesis.  Genetic studies, in particular, have failed to               
              support the notion of trade-offs in insect performance across plant            
              species upon which the theory is based.  While ecological studies              
              which take into account three trophic levels have supported the                
              hypothesis that predators may be a strong selective agent on insect            
              host range, there are currently no genetic studies of hostplant-               
              mediated predation.  The research proposed here uses an adapted                
              specialist lepidopteran herbivore, Junonia coenia, which recycles              
              plant allelochemicals as a defense against predators to assess: 1)             
              the responses of invertebrate predators to intraspecific variation             
              in levels of sequestered allelochemicals, 2) the genetic basis of              
              allelochemical tolerance and sequestration, 3) the genetic                     
              relationship of oviposition preferences with physiological                     
              adaptation and protection from predation, and 4) the interaction of            
              adaptation to hostplant chemistry and the plant's chemical defence.            
              By combining field studies of predation with quantitative genetic              
              analyses of adaption to phytochemistry and predators, this study               
              will integrate these seemingly contradictory single-factor                     
              hypotheses.  A practical result will be a greater understanding of             
              the biology of plant pests.
