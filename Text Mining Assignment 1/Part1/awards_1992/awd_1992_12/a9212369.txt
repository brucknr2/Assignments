Abstract    :
              9212369   Reed   We propose to develop a portable tool set to explore the design
               space for scalable input/output systems.  This tool set will take  the form of
              a user-level input library that will be portable  across several parallel
              systems, permitting a wide range of  experimentation with modest human
              resources.  These input/output  libraries will be invoked by user input/output
              calls and will  rely on the underlying system software for physical
              input/output.   Interposing the libraries between the application and the
              system  software will allow us to quickly experiment with a variety of  data
              distribution and data management algorithms.  For example,  local read ahead
              and write behind policies could be implemented  in the user-level library. 
              Alternatively,  we could explore  coordinated global prefetching policies
              coupled with distributed  caching.
