Abstract    :
              This award, of $390,000, is for research and curriculum development            
              for power plant intelligent distributed control.  Many new                     
              specialized skills in applying simulation, computer networking, and            
              microprocessor-based controller programming have been acquired by              
              the faculty and graduate students that have been choosing this                 
              research.  In order to accelerate the achievement of the goal of               
              improving power generation reliability, economy, and safety through            
              the implementation of modern control technologies, an efficient                
              mechanism is needed for teaching new graduate students and industry            
              specialists the required skills for conducting applied research in             
              this area.  For this purpose, current research will be expanded to             
              plant-wide system implementation and an introductory graduate level            
              course will be developed over a three year period.  The course will            
              later be suitable for advanced undergraduates that are going to                
              graduate school or will be employed in the power industry.
