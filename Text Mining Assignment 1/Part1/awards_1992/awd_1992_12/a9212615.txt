Abstract    :
                   This contract is to conduct Phases I and II of Cycle IV of                
              the National Survey of Academic Research Instruments and                       
              Instrumentation Needs during the period 1992-1995.  This survey,               
              a sample survey of higher education institutions, will be                      
              conducted in two phases.  Phase I will collect and process only                
              the department/facility survey questionnaire, which will survey                
              academic departments or nondepartmental research units that                    
              contain at least one research instrument system costing $20,000                
              or more.  During Phase II the contractor will collect and process              
              the full-scale survey, which consists of both the department/                  
              facility questionnaire, and an equipment questionnaire which will              
              be used to collect data for samples of research instrument                     
              systems within sampled departments/facilities.  The sample shall               
              be limited to instruments with an original purchase price of                   
              $20,000 or more.  Contractor tasks for Cycle IV will include                   
              conduct of data collection activities, tabulation of data                      
              results, provision of technical support as required for the                    
              National Science Foundation's own analytical uses of the data,                 
              and production of final analytical reports summarizing the                     
              results of the study.                                                          
                                                                                             
                   The 96th Congress (Public Law 96-44, Section 7) directed NSF              
              to "...develop indices, correlates, or other suitable measures or              
              indicators of the status of scientific instrumentation in the                  
              United States and of the current and projected need for                        
              scientific and technological instrumentation."  This study,                    
              initiated in response to the above mandate, measures changes and               
              trends in the instrumentation needs and the national inventory of              
              scientific research equipment in academic institutions.
