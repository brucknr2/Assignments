Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The proposal is concerned with the synthesis and                               
              characterization of new gas adsorbents to be used especially                   
              with the pressure swing adsorption process, and with the                       
              modeling of hysteresis in the PSA process.  Four kinds of                      
              adsorbents will be studied:  pillared clays, ion-exchanged                     
              zeolites, polymeric adsorbents and modified carbon molecular                   
              sieves.                                                                        
                                                                                             
              With regard to the synthesis of new pillared clays, and PI has                 
              already synthesized and studied ZrO2 and AL2O3 PILC's, and                     
              these studies indicated that the equilibrium separation of                     
              N2/CH4 and O2/N2 are feasible with AL-PILC.  The PI suggests                   
              new experiments in which pillared clays already synthesized                    
              for catalytic purposes will be modified to improve their                       
              sorbent characteristics.  The zeolites which will be studied                   
              are ion-exchanged A and X type and clinoptilolites.  The PI                    
              gives some preliminary data which indicates that the                           
              clinoptilolites are promising sorbents for kinetic separation                  
              of N2 and CH4.  Polymeric adsorbents will focus on                             
              unfunctionalized polystyrenic sorbents, whose preliminary data                 
              indicates that the SO2 and NOx adsorption amounts are                          
              significant, to particularly functionalized adsorbents.  With                  
              regard to the modelling of hysterisis in the PSA process,                      
              single particle cyclic scanning curves will be measured using                  
              a TGA, and these results will be used in modeling the PSA                      
              process.
