Abstract    :
              9212437  Orlans  This project will plan and test a pilot program to train
              college  teachers to introduce the consideration of ethical issues that  deal
              with the use of animals for research and education into  their biology classes
              in their home institutions.  College  teachers in the biological sciences need
              preparation to enable  them to consider these controversial ethical and policy 
              questions, that face them directly, and that face society  generally.  This
              six-day intensive summer program will include  approximately 15 participants
              from academic centers in the 100  mile region surrounding Washington DC. 
              Course content will be  broad, well-balanced, and will include opposing
              viewpoints.   Visits to the surrounding institutions before the workshop will 
              identify a biology faculty consultant who will work with the  course directors
              to assure its relevance and sensitivity to the  needs of faculty participants,
              and will stimulate faculty  interest in the course.  Post-course visits will
              assess progress  in achieving the course goals of stimulating curriculum change
              to  include discussion of ethical and policy issues involving animal  use. 
              Planning for further workshops will depend on and  incorporate results from
              this pilot effort.  ***
