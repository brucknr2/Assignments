Abstract    :
              Telecommunication technology has                                               
              advanced to the point where direct                                             
              failure of critical equipment is                                               
              unlikely in modern central offices.                                            
              However, increasing robustness of                                              
              equipment is partly compromised by                                             
              other trends:  fewer trunks and more                                           
              concentration of switching offices                                             
              (fiber optics technology), more                                                
              complex switching/signaling

              in the equipment and their host                                                
              facilities.  The result is that                                                
              failure is now more likely to be                                               
              caused by collateral hazards and                                               
              failure of supporting lifelines, and                                           
              as a result the impact of the                                                  
              failure on an urban system would be                                            
              much greater than in the past.                                                 
                                                                                             
              This project studies the effects of
