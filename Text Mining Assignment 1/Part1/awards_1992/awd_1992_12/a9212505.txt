Abstract    :
              This is an award to provide support for purchase of Lanthanum-                 
              Hexaboride electron source for the Department of Civil                         
              Engineering's environmental scanning electron microscope.  The                 
              source is expected to enhance the resolution and contrast of                   
              images in the study of biocorrosion of ferrous metals, control of              
              the stability of immobilized contaminants, study of creep in                   
              moist rock salt that comprises subsurface geological strata that               
              are planned for use in storage of wastes, and for remediation of               
              radiocolloids.                                                                 
                                                                                             
              This proposal was submitted in accord with conditions listed in                
              the publication Research Equipment Grant Program Announcement and              
              Guidelines (NSF 90-146).  The aquisition of this equipment is                  
              expected to improve the efficiency of the research being                       
              conducted, results of which are expected to be utilized in                     
              engineering design of waste management processes and systems.
