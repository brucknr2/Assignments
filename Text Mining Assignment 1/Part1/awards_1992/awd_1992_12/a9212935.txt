Abstract    :
              This research will examine the emerging uses of computer-mediated              
              communication technologies by American Indians and the subsequent              
              cultural changes associated with them.  The researcher will study              
              two on-line communities which have been identified as having                   
              significant American Indian populations; the Electronic Native                 
              American Network (ENAN) and NATIVEnet.  ENAN is an on-line                     
              computer network which serves Indian children and tribal                       
              educators from across the United States.  Funded by the Bureau of              
              Indian Affairs, ENAN resides on a desk-top computer at the                     
              University of New Mexico and is accessed by four toll free                     
              telephone lines.  NATIVEnet is a "news-group" (list-serv)                      
              residing on the NSF-funded INTERNET.  It connects American                     
              Indians and scholars interested in indigenous issues from around               
              the world.  These two networks will be studied using theorems                  
              from convergence and network theory which have a bearing on                    
              intercultural communication and cultural change.  Techniques used              
              in data collection will include the experimental construction of               
              sociograms of the networked interpersonal relationships, content               
              analysis of several years of on-line discussions, and                          
              ethnographic data derived from participant observation.  Results               
              will contribute to the development of network theory, as applied               
              to intercultural computer-mediated communication, and to                       
              understanding the relationships of information and network social              
              policy to cultural change.  Results will be disseminated to                    
              relevant Indian organizations, tribal leaders, and appropriate                 
              scientific journals.
