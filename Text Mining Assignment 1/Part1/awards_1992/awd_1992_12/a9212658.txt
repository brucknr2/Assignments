Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The Synchrotron Radiation Center (SRC) operated by the                         
              University of Wisconsin-Madison, is a national facility                        
              for the utilization of ultra-violet and soft x-ray                             
              synchrotron radiation in scientific investigations.  The                       
              studies carried out at the SRC impact condensed matter                         
              physics, atomic and molecular physics, chemistry,                              
              materials science and engineering, biology, and other                          
              disciplines.  The SRC is a user oriented facility which                        
              accepts proposals from all qualified investigators.  At                        
              present, more than 300 individuals make up 75 groups                           
              which conduct research on the 26 operating beamlines at                        
              the SRC.  Of these groups, 69% are from universities, 19%                      
              are from national laboratories, and 12% are industrial                         
              affiliates.  The SRC operation includes nine public                            
              beamlines, sixteen Participating Research Team (PRT)                           
              beamlines, one joint SRC/PRT beam line, and three                              
              beamlines under development.   Eighteen operating lines                        
              have monochromators.   They cover the photon energy range                      
              from a few eV to several keV.  The SRC operates at two                         
              electron energies: 800 MeV and 1 GeV.  A clean room and                        
              a chemical handling room are maintained for users.                             
              Several unique beamlines are available including five                          
              beamlines operated by the Center for X-ray Lithography,                        
              a beam line developed for high resolution photoemission                        
              x-ray microscopy utilizing an undulator (Multiple                              
              Application X-ray Imaging Undulator Microscope-MAXIMUM),                       
              a high resolution photoelectron spectroscopy beam line                         
              being developed for band-structure measurements of Fermi-                      
              surface contours in high-Tc superconducting materials, a                       
              high precision soft x-ray double-crystal monochromator                         
              beam line which provides a tunable beam in the 1500-3700                       
              Ev range for Extended X-ray Absorption Fine Structure                          
              studies (EXAFS).
