Abstract    :
              The history of science in America cannot be discussed without                  
              acknowledging the central role that James McKeen Cattell (1860-                
              1944) played in its development.  He was a psychologist trained in             
              Europe whose first experiments led directly to the formation of                
              behavioralist psychology, and he originated the first program of               
              mental tests in 1890 as part of a goal of creating an applied                  
              psychology.  Yet his major contribution to science was not in the              
              field in which he was trained.  For Cattell played a major role in             
              the emergence of Columbia University and the New York scientific               
              community; he was a long-time owner and editor of the journal                  
              Science  as well as a number of other important scientific                     
              periodicals;  he created American Men of Science (now American Men             
              and Women of Science) and controlled for many years the American               
              Association for the Advancement of Science.  His mark thus remains             
              indelibly on the major institutions of modern American science.                
              Dr. Sokal is undertaking a major study of Cattell's life and work.             
              Dr. Sokal argues that Cattell approached his work with an                      
              understanding of science rooted in the 19th century.  He plans to              
              trace how Cattell's 20th century significance emerged directly from            
              his 19th century attitudes.  This study promises to enhance our                
              understanding of how American science came to be organized as it is            
              today.
