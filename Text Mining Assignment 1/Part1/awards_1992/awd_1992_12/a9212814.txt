Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Litter quality, decomposition rate, and N mineralization are                   
              strongly connected and control nutrient availability over time                 
              scales of 0-5 y.  However, little is known about species effects               
              on soil humus turnover (turnover time >10 y).  Ecosystem                       
              simulation models show that the humus fraction contains the                    
              largest pool of N and controls N availability over longer time                 
              scales (>10 y).  This project will test whether species                        
              differences in litter quality and quantity influence the turnover              
              of humus.  Specifically, these investigators will address (1)                  
              whether litter quality and quantity alter the physical protection              
              of SOM and the turnover rate of humus fractions, and (2) whether               
              species influence labile SOM (turnover time < 5 y) and if this                 
              could change humus mineralization rate.  These questions will be               
              addressed at sites where only species differences have modified                
              SOM characteristics.  Long-term laboratory incubations will be                 
              used to assess species effects on C and N mineralization kinetics.             
              Species differences in litter quality and quantity will then be                
              related to characteristics of the different humus fractions.  This             
              project will show whether species modify humus turnover and                    
              whether this influences long-term soil fertility.
