Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Funded under an Engineering Research Equipment Grant,                          
              equipment will be purchased to support a variety of projects                   
              involving the development application of advanced flow field                   
              diagnostics.  The equipment consists of cameras and motion                     
              analysis equipment, and will be utilized in conjunction with                   
              recently developed techniques for embedding marked tracers in                  
              rapidly varying flows.                                                         
                                                                                             
              The flows of interest range from low speed to supersonic, and                  
              the novel diagnostics will help resolve details necessary for                  
              the eventual development of improved modeling and predictive                   
              tools for a variety of engineering flow systems.
