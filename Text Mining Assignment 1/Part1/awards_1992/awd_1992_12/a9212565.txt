Abstract    :
                    The Santa Cruz Mudstone is a thick unit (approximately 2000m)            
              of siliceous mudstones in north-central California that appears to             
              be correlative with the upper part of the Miocene Monterey                     
              Formation.  The unit is exposed in the Bolinas-Point Reyes and                 
              Santa Cruz areas where it has been significantly offset by movement            
              along the San Andreas fault system.  The age, stratigraphy, and                
              paleoceanography of the Santa Cruz Mudstones are poorly known.  The            
              major objectives of a multi-year study on the Santa Cruz Mudstone              
              would be:  (1) to precisely date the age of the Santa Cruz Mudstone            
              using diatom biostratigraphy, (2) to describe and document                     
              stratigraphic cycles between silica-rich and carbonate-rich rocks,             
              and (3) to assess the timing and paleoceanographic significance of             
              prominent bedding cycles and other stratigraphic variations within             
              the Santa Cruz Mudstone.  A planning period will facilitate                    
              preliminary data collection and the effective evaluation of a                  
              multi-year research plan.  Two major objectives during the planning            
              year are:  (1) to conduct reconnaissance field work and sampling               
              (for diatoms) and (2) evaluate and synthesize field and age data               
              and write a competitive multi-year research proposal.  The most                
              significant aspect of this investigation is the results are                    
              expected to reflect complex climate and sea level variations during            
              the late Miocene.  Results such as these will increase our                     
              understanding of sediments deposited beneath ancient upwelling,                
              high fertility systems.
