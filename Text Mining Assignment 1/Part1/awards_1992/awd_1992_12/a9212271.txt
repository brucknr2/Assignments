Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Funded through an Engineering Research Equipment Grant,                        
              equipment will be purchased for the case in a variety of                       
              investigations relevant to the dynamic behavior of polymers:                   
              phase separation phenomena, dynamic relaxation, and                            
              rheological materials characterization.  The equipment                         
              consists of a mechanical spectrometer.                                         
                                                                                             
              Application areas for this research are polymer processing                     
              (coating, mixing), as well as biological systems (blood                        
              clotting).
