Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Given the rapid changes taking place in scientific computing and               
              the Federal High-Performance Computing and Communications multi-               
              agency program, it is important to examine future directions for               
              the NSF Supercomputer Centers Programs, its organizational                     
              structure and its role in the overall national effort in high                  
              performance computing.  The Program Advisory Committee (PAC) of the            
              Division of Advanced Scientific Computing will convene a workshop              
              on this subject on March 7-8 1992, to provide NSF with broadly-                
              based input from experts in the field, and to prepare position                 
              papers which will serve as the basis for the report.  Topics for               
              discussion at this workshop will be:                                           
                                                                                             
              1) Access: The major function of the Centers Program is to provide             
              access to state of the art computational facilities for the                    
              national research community.  What facilities will be needed in                
              the coming years.                                                              
                                                                                             
              2) Infrastructure development: What should be role of the Centers              
              in developing human and computational infrastructure?                          
                                                                                             
              3) Catalysis and technology transfer: What should be the role of               
              the Centers in relation to the high performance computer industry              
              and the industrial user community?                                             
                                                                                             
              4) Process: Are changes needed in the structure of the Centers                 
              Program?  How should it be reviewed and renewed?  What should be               
              the relationship between the Centers Program and other high                    
              performance computing programs supported by the NSF, other federal             
              agencies and state government?
