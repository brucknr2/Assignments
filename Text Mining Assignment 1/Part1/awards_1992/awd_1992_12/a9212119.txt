Abstract    :
              The Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering at                       
              Clarkson University will purchase a flume for multiphase flow                  
              studies which will be dedicated to support the following                       
              studies:  (1) simultaneous transport of a simulated frazil ice                 
              and sediment in rivers; (2) conveyance characteristics of                      
              solid-liquid transport at large solid fractions; (3) water                     
              wave and ice fragment interaction; (4) mass transport                          
              relationships for nearly buoyant sediments; and (5) the                        
              surface transport of contaminants (oil) and their mixing into                  
              the water column.  The Flume for multiphase flow studies                       
              consists of a rectangular channel with a working length of 40'                 
              (12.2m) in length having a cross section width and height of                   
              1'-6" (0.457m) by 2' (0.610m) respectively.  The flume is                      
              designed  to simultaneously recirculate water and two                          
              separate solid phase.  One phase is to be buoyant and the                      
              other non buoyant.  The flow rate of water and each solid                      
              phase can be independently controlled.  The bed of the channel                 
              can be varied between slopes of 0 and +6 degrees.  Specially                   
              designed discharge storage facilities will be provided enable                  
              studies to be conducted on the surface spreading of immiscible                 
              fluids such as oil in water.  The results of these studies                     
              will have application in the civil infrastructure and                          
              industry.
