Abstract    :
                   This research will develop methods for proving lower                      
              bounds on the complexity of general Boolean circuits for                       
              computing specific functions.  Several directions appear                       
              promising.  One is the topological approach of Sipser, where                   
              infinitary analogs suggest ways to apply concepts from                         
              descriptive set theory.  The second is an approach suggested                   
              by Karchmer, Raz and Wigderson for obtaining high depth                        
              complexity by composing hard functions.  The third is a method                 
              suggested by Razborov as a generalization of the approximation                 
              method he used to obtain monotone lower bounds.
