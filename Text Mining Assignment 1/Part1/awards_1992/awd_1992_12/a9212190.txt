Abstract    :
              As part of a series of research projects aimed at marrying machine             
              learning technology to economically important problems, this                   
              project in concerned with the task of finding errors in databases.             
              Because many database situations do not afford the luxury of a                 
              surplus programmer, machine learning methods are used to construct             
              prescriptive data models.  These models predict appropriate values             
              for data attributes, and if actual values differ, an alarm is                  
              raised.  Two basic research issues in database consistency checking            
              are studied.  First, fundamental limitation of a common class of               
              learning methods is identified, then a new learning formulation is             
              proposed.  Second, this research reiterates the need to incorporate            
              expert knowledge into the learning process, and a space of possible            
              approaches.  Understanding of  the resulting new methods will lead             
              to  advances in the quality and applicability of database                      
              consistency systems, and as a consequence, to improved performance             
              in the wide variety of systems that rely on high quality data.
