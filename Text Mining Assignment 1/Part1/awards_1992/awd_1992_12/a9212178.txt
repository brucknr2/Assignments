Abstract    :
              This project funded by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organo-                 
              metallic Chemistry Program is for the continuation of studies                  
              by Professor Rauchfuss in the area of transition metal-sulfur                  
              chemistry.  Topics to be pursued include a variety of studies                  
              on ruthenium-sulfur clusters with the cubane skeleton.  Special                
              emphasis will be placed on their reactions with electrophiles                  
              and on the investigation of the mobility of metal-metal bonds                  
              within the clusters.   Syntheses of mixed metal versions will                  
              be undertaken to provide further information concerning the                    
              mobility of metal-metal bonds in the clusters.  Newly                          
              discovered donor solvent promoted reactions of elemental sulfur                
              and oxidizing sulfur compounds (carbon disulfide and organic                   
              disulfides) with metals and zero-valent metal compounds will be                
              explored for their synthetic utility in the preparation of new                 
              sulfur containing transition metal compounds.

              This research involves the development of new chemistry of                     
              transition metals and sulfur  with emphasis on the synthesis                   
              and reactivity of polynuclear compounds.  The results of this                  
              research may aid in the development of new catalysts for use in                
              petroleum refining or in new advanced materials.
