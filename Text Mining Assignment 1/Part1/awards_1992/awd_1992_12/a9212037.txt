Abstract    :
                   This career advancement award supports the research of                    
              Professor Shubov to study the asymptotic behavior of resonances for            
              Schrodinger operators with Coulomb-like potentials. Professor                  
              Shubov also intends to investigate many-particle quantum systems.              
                   Modern physics, quantum mechanics and relativity, is a product            
              of the twentieth century.  It is founded firmly in the last                    
              century's attempt to address the microstructure of matter and to               
              come to grips with the concepts of action-at-a distance, electro-              
              magnetism, and heat radiation.  The mathematical foundations for               
              these developments, collectively called mathematical physics,                  
              ranges from detailed analysis of Schrodinger operators, which                  
              governs the dynamics of particles, to unified field theory, which              
              attempts to unite the four known forces into a single theory.
