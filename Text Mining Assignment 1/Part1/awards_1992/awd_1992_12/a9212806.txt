Abstract    :
              This equipment will be used for                                                
              several research projects,                                                     
              including, in particular, (i) the

              synthesis rates during the cell                                                
              cycle of Saccharomyces cerevisiae,                                             
              (ii) the study of protein synthesis                                            
              and secretion in mammalian cells,                                              
              and (iii) the evaluation of feeding                                            
              and growth rates during the cell
