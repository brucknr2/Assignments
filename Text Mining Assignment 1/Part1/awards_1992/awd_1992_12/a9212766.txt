Abstract    :
                   Digital image coding of color video sequences will be                     
              supported by the new equipment purchased under the aegis of                    
              this award.  The system will be used for developing and                        
              implementing data compression and digital signal processing                    
              algorithms which will be applied to visual interactive systems                 
              such as medical imaging or videotext.  Acquisition of the                      
              equipment will stimulate development of applications                           
              algorithms suitable for broadband integrated services digital                  
              networks.
