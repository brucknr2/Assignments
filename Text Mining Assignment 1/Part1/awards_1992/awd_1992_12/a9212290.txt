Abstract    :
              Professor Constant is building on recent work in anthropology and              
              philosophy of science for his study of how science literally                   
              transforms society and how society transforms science.  The core of            
              this study is an historical account of the interaction between                 
              developing petroleum engineering science and the oil fraternity in             
              Texas.  He is trying to capture the processes of negotiation and               
              renegotiation by which they jointly produced and reconstructed                 
              "social reality" (their relationship to each other and to the rest             
              of the Texas power structure) and "physical reality" (the nature of            
              the subsurface petroleum reserves).  He is doing this by studying              
              in detail the ways that Texas oil men turned to scientists to help             
              determine the best way to exploit oil riches, how scientists                   
              adjusted their work to meet the needs of the oil men, and how both             
              cooperated to establish a regulatory system in Texas to manage the             
              oil industry. On the basis of this detailed case study, Professor              
              Constant hopes to develop a general model of the interactions of               
              science, technology and society.  This study thus promises insights            
              not only into the history of oil industry in Texas, but a real                 
              contribution to the entire field of studies in science, technology             
              and society.
