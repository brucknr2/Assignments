Abstract    :
              It is proposed that the standard oedometer test, properly                      
              conducted, can be used to determine all the necessary parameters               
              to implement the unrestricted theory in the consolidation aspects              
              of geotechnical engineering practice for undisturbed and remolded              
              soils.  This research would synthesize and prove the viability of              
              the use of unrestricted consolidation theory for a wide range of               
              soft soils, and would develop the methodology for applying the                 
              theory in a form that could be easily used by all geotechnical                 
              engineers at a minimum cost in time and equipment.
