Abstract    :
              This is a one year Planning Grant to a young Principal Investigator            
              at the University of Guam to conduct numerical simulations of                  
              tilted accretion disks in models of pulsar binary systems. The aim             
              of this project is to bring together high energy (x- and gamma-                
              ray) and optical observations to attempt to discriminate among                 
              competing theories of the "long periods" of x-ray pulsar binary                
              systems, such as precisions of tilted disks and obscurations of                
              the pulsar emission by clumps in the disks.
