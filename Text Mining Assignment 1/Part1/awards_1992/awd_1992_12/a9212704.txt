Abstract    :
              This archaeological project will investigate two Late                          
              Pleistocene/Early Holocene archaeological sites and carry out                  
              surveys on the Kisarilik and Holitna River drainages in Southwest              
              Alaska. The purpose is to define the artifact, settlement and land-            
              use relationships of ancient Siberian hunter-gatherer societies                
              which first settled Alaska. This project addresses the need to                 
              define the earliest origins of Native peoples and cultures in the              
              New World.
