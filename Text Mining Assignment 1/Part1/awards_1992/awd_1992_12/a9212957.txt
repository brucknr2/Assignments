Abstract    :
              The MINT Center at the University of                                           
              Alabama will purchase equipment to upgrade                                     
              an existing Vac-Tec four target sputtering                                     
              system.  Specifically the proposal requests                                    
              funds for retro-fitting a computer based                                       
              control system and the installation of a                                       
              dedicated residual gas analyzer.  The                                          
              equipment will be used to accelerate progress                                  
              on several research projects, including an                                     
              investigation of the physical, magnetic and                                    
              magnetoresistive properties of giant                                           
              magnetoresistance multilayers for use in MR                                    
              heads, and of the properties of sputtered FeN                                  
              based materials for both thin film recording                                   
              heads and media.  Both of these projects                                       
              currently receive significant NSF funding in                                   
              the form of individual investigator grants.  A                                 
              continuing commitment to these education and                                   
              training of graduate students is evidenced by                                  
              13 students supported on related projects.                                     
              The performance increases, which may be                                        
              possible using these materials, especially in                                  
              atomically engineered multilayer                                               
              configurations, make them very attractive                                      
              candidates for exploitation in the data                                        
              recording industry.  The routine production of                                 
              multilayers composed of a large number of                                      
              identical bilayers and of reactively sputtered                                 
              FeN films and multilayers requires a high                                      
              degree of process control.  This control will                                  
              be provided by the proposed upgrade greatly                                    
              enhancing the ongoing research program.
