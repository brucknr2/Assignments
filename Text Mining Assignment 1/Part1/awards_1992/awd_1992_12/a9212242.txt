Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  This is a study of the transition from state socialism to                 
              capitalism in Russia.  Case studies of the wood, coal, gas and                 
              military industries in the Komi region will be undertaken to                   
              examine the hypothesis that the transition exaggerates                         
              pathologies of the old economic order, leading towards a form of               
              merchant capitalism.  It is also hypothesized, that with the                   
              collapse of the party state, there is an intensification of                    
              monopoly, an increase in barter, and increased worker control                  
              over production.  Current policies of shock therapy, involving                 
              stabilizing currency, price liberalization, bringing down tariffs              
              and privatization may not lead to modern capitalism but may                    
              create a form of merchant capitalism which may create obstacles                
              to economic development.                                                       
                   This study will make a significant contribution to our                    
              understanding of the ways in which the old economic system under               
              state socialism may present a series of obstacles to change in                 
              economic organization in spite of widespread political support                 
              for such changes.
