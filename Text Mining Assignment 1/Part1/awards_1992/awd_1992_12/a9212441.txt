Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Factors which interact with and influence complex learned behavior             
              include circulating hormone levels, brain neurotransmitters and                
              changes in neuroanatomy. In this award, Dr. Cheryl Harding will                
              quantify levels and turnover of two transmitter substances,                    
              norepinephrine and dopamine, in a variety of brain regions involved            
              in avian vocal learning. The studies will be done at critical times            
              during brain development and the sensitive period for vocal                    
              learning. In adults, levels and turnover of these neurotransmitters            
              in the brain areas under study are strongly modulated by                       
              circulating hormone levels. Therefore, circulating hormone levels              
              will also be assessed to determine if changing hormone levels                  
              during development have similar effects on neurotransmitter                    
              function. This research will look for evidence that these                      
              neurotranmitters might be involved in stimulating some of the                  
              dramatic neuroanatomical changes which occur in these brain areas              
              during early development and the period of vocal learning. The                 
              potential contributions of norepinephrine and dopamine in these                
              areas to the learning of a complex social beahvior and the                     
              modulation of this process by circulating hormones will also be                
              assessed. The knowledge gained in these studies will be important              
              in understanding the factors which are involved in the development             
              and learning of vocalization and communication.
