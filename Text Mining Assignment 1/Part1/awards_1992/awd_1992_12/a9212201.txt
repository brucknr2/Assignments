                                         ABSTRACT                                            
                                                                                             
                  There is little prospective scientific research on the                    
              development of individual differences in positive orientations                 
              toward other people.  This orientation can be conceptualized as                
              predispositions along one dimension.  At one end of the                        
              dimension, some individuals appear to have an enduring                         
              predisposition toward altruism, kindness, social warmth, and                   
              cooperativeness.  At the other end, some individuals appear to be              
              predisposed toward behaviors that have been labeled hostile,                   
              aggressive, and cold-hearted.  An interlocking program of                      
              research will examine this individual difference dimension in                  
              children and adolescents.  Socialization patterns may be                       
              systematically related to its development.  This research will                 
              conduct basic foundational work upon which later work can build.               
              The first part of the research program will focus on reliability               
              and validity, using computer assessments to obtain self-ratings                
              from children and adolescents.  This evidence will be compared                 
              with adult and peer ratings of the same children for the                       
              convergence in assessments.  In addition, an observational study               
              will focus on parental socialization of emotional self-                        
              regulation.  The research is designed to build basic links from                
              personality toward developmental and social psychological                      
              approaches to social interaction.
