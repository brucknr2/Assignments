Abstract    :
              Coordinated arenes can serve as valuable synthons to a variety                 
              of mono-and polycyclic natural products when used in                           
              conjunction with an appropriate dihapto-coordination agent.  In                
              order to test and develop this hypothesis, the research program                
              will address three primary questions: i) what organic                          
              transformations can be accomplished through such a technology                  
              that are difficult to achieve by conventional methods, ii) to                  
              what extent can the stereochemistry of such transformations be                 
              controlled by the transition metal, and iii) how can the nature                
              of the complexing agent be modified to achieve a) greater                      
              activation of the aromatic substrate b) asymmetric induction,                  
              and c) a catalytic cycle for various target reactions?

              With this award, the Organic Synthesis Program will support the                
              research of Dr. W. Dean Harman at the University of Virginia.                  
              The research will develop the reactions of coordinated arene                   
              transition metal complexes to form substituted cyclic products                 
              which has the effect of shortening certain synthetic sequences.                
              This new synthetic methodology should benefit research in                      
              biochemistry and medicine as well as in the chemical industry.
