Abstract    :
                   In this project laboratory experiments on the OH radical                  
              pertinent to three major needs for monitoring particular trace                 
              species in the atmosphere will be carried out.  The study of                   
              polarization of laser-induced fluorescence in the A-X electronic               
              system of OH, and the modeling of state-to-state rotational energy             
              transfer in the A-state, concern detection of OH itself in the                 
              troposphere.  Transition probabilities for weak vibrational bands              
              of the A-X system impact OH detection as well as studies of OH                 
              kinetics for atmospheric purposes.  Collisional quenching of high              
              rotational levels in the A-State, and the temperature dependence of            
              this process, govern quantum yields in the measurement of                      
              stratospheric H2O with a Lyman-a hygrometer.  HNO3 is a molecule               
              difficult to detect at the low levels present in the relatively                
              clean troposphere.  SRI scientists study the nascent distribution              
              of OH over vibrational and rotational levels, following the                    
              photodissociation of HNO3, and the relaxation of this distribution             
              to a thermal one.  These data are necessary for the design of a                
              photoframentation/laser-induced fluorescence method for nitric acid            
              monitoring.
