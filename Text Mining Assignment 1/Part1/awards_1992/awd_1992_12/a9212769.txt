Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This project continues research by the investigator in four areas              
              of general equilibrium analysis: (1) the existence and optimality              
              of competitive equilibrium in markets with an infinite number of               
              commodities; (2) the spanning and pricing of derivative assets,                
              with call options in markets with infinite state spaces; (3) the               
              allocation of resources in market economies with increasing                    
              returns to scale in production; and (4) general equilibrium                    
              restrictions on market prices and income distributions.  This                  
              research provides a more rigorous and general theory for studying              
              incomplete financial markets, macroeconomics, economic growth and              
              other important areas of economics.                                            
                                                                                             
              More specifically, the contributions under this grant for  these               
              four areas consists of (1) proving the existence of equilibria in              
              two-period and three-period incomplete markets general                         
              equilibrium models, where the state space is infinite, for both                
              the cases of a finite and infinite number of marketed financial                
              assets;                                                                        
              (2) providing a constructive existence proof of pseudo-equilibria              
              in general equilibrium models with incomplete asset markets;                   
              (3) establishing the existence of a two-part pricing equilibrium               
              with imperfect information and examining its optimality; and (4)               
              extending the Brown-Matzkin model of revealed equilibrium                      
              analysis to accommodate random utility functions or errors in                  
              measurement.
