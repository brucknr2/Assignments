Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              It has never been possible until very recently to measure the                  
              natural distribution patterns of odor in the environment.  Dr.                 
              Atema and his colleagues have developed tools to make such high-               
              resolution measurements based on the odor-sampling equipment of                
              lobsters.  The lobster and the aquatic environment are                         
              particularly favorable to carry out this fundamental research on               
              odor-sampling.  The present research will try to extract from                  
              such odor measurements the salient features that allow animals to              
              track turbulent odor plumes and locate their source.                           
                                                                                             
              Results from this work will open up our human understanding of an              
              almost unknown sensory world, but one used by many animals, both               
              aquatic and terrestrial.  Practical applications can be expected               
              almost immediately in the design of odor-tracking underwater                   
              vehicles.
