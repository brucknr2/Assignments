Abstract    :
              The Department of Civil Engineering at the University of Utah                  
              will purchase computer automated and controlled triaxial and                   
              oedometric equipment for testing soil specimens. This equipment                
              will be dedicated to support research in engineering. The                      
              equipment will be used for several research projects,                          
              including in particular: 1. Stress-State Analysis in                           
              Unsaturated Soils; 2. Chemical Stabilization of Soils; 3.                      
              In Situ Stabilization of Soils; 4. Study of Playas and                         
              Desert Basins; 5. Permeability in Marine Sediments; 6.                         
              Ground Water Monitoring.
