Abstract    :
                   Arveson will investigate several areas of non-commutative                 
              analysis involving von Neumann algebras and C*-algebras, quantized             
              index theory, and the role of the non-commutative spheres of                   
              Bratteli, Elliott, Evans and Kishimoto in numerical quantum                    
              mechanics.  The research will involve the index theory and                     
              classification theory of semigroups of endomorphisms of factors,               
              the structure of the C*-algebras associated to such semigroups, and            
              the properties of C*-algebras associated with the discretized                  
              canonical commutation relations.                                               
                   The general area of mathematics of this project has its basis             
              in the theory of algebras of Hilbert space operators.  Operators               
              can be thought of as finite or infinite matrices of complex                    
              numbers.  Special types of operators are often put together in an              
              algebra, naturally called an operator algebra.  These abstract                 
              objects have a surprising variety of applications.  For example,               
              they play a key role in knot theory, which in turn is  currently               
              being used to study the structure of DNA, and they are of                      
              fundamental importance in noncommutative geometry, which is                    
              becoming increasingly important in physics.
