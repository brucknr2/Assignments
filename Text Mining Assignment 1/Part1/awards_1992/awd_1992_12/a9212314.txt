Abstract    :
              This award, of $390,000, is for support of a program of research               
              and education in the development of advanced chemical microsensors             
              for industrial process monitoring and control.  The objective of               
              this project is to enhance the competitiveness of American chemical            
              and high technology industries by providing a means to monitor                 
              their processes in real time.  In order to perform this task,                  
              advanced senor technology is being developed to be employed on-line            
              in industrial processes.   The major emphasis in this program is               
              an interdisciplinary effort between the departments of electrical              
              engineering and chemistry to perform research and to educate                   
              students -- graduate as well as undergraduate -- in the field of               
              process chemical sensors.  Courses in basic and advanced sensor                
              development and applications are emphasized, and hands-on training             
              in these areas is also included.  These courses are blended with               
              existing courses which support an overall curriculum for this                  
              emerging field of science and engineering.
