Abstract    :
              Professor Schaffner is examining theory structure and research                 
              strategies in molecular biology.  In order to develop a more                   
              general approach to these issues, he is first undertaking three                
              detailed case studies:  a recent historical inquiry into the                   
              molecular explanation of the generation of antibody diversity;                 
              simple molecular learning mechanisms in Aplysia; and the genetic               
              control of the life cycle of the HIV virus.  These case studies are            
              intended to lead to a broader conceptualization of theory structure            
              and research strategies in molecular biology.  This                            
              conceptualization should include an examination of the conceptual              
              structure of theories, models, mechanisms, principles, and                     
              generalizations in molecular biology, and their relations to                   
              experimental results and new experimental technologies.  Professor             
              Schaffner is then considering ways in which these elements (e.g.               
              theories, models, principles . . .) change as science progresses,              
              and what dynamical factors drive such changes.  As part of this                
              study, he is examining various heuristics for theory and model                 
              changes and the proposal and evaluation of laboratory experiments.
