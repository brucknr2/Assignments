Abstract    :
              The Department of Electrical Engineering at                                    
              the University of Minnesota will purchase a                                    
              wavelength tunable sub-picosecond Ti:Sapphire                                  
              laser system for our research program in                                       
              semiconductor nanostructures and ultra-fast                                    
              devices.  The equipment is critical to more                                    
              than seven ongoing research projects that are                                  
              conducted by four faculty members and nine                                     
              graduate students in the department.  The                                      
              projects include, in particular, study and                                     
              characterization of (1) new semiconductor                                      
              nanostructures, (2) band-gap engineering                                       
              materials, (3) high-speed (>100 GHz) FETs,                                     
              (4) tera-hertz metal-semiconductor-metal                                       
              photodetectors, (5) tera-hertz planar                                          
              modulators, and (6) self-electrooptic-effect                                   
              devices.//
