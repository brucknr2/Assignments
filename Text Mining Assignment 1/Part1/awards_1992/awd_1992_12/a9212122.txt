Abstract    :
              This award, "DEDS: A New Paradigm for Performance Analysis,                    
              Computation and Optimization," made under the program for "Combined            
              Research Curriculum Development in Technological Areas of national             
              Importance," is motivated by the rapid technological changes which             
              have brought the need to design, analyze, and control Discrete                 
              Event Dynamic Systems (DEDS).  DEDS are typified by networks for               
              communications, manufacturing, computer traffic, and other systems             
              governed by man-made rules.  As a paradigm change is ripe to take              
              place in the study of these systems, perhaps similar to the major              
              conceptual advances that occurred during the Sputnik era in control            
              system theory, new methods for design, control, and optimization               
              are needed.  The major focus of this award is to bring research                
              results in DEDS into the classroom.  This effort includes the                  
              development of new courses and a simulation-based instructional                
              "electronic" laboratory, and an innovative approach for the                    
              dissemination of the project  results that exploits recent advances            
              in educational technology.
