Abstract    :
                   In a continuation of a previously successful Research                     
              Experiences for Undergraduates Site effort, eight different                    
              meteorological organizations ranging from a university to a                    
              National Weather Service Office will host up to ten undergraduate              
              students during the Summer of 1992.  The students will attend                  
              lectures, be exposed to a wide variety of research, academic and               
              operational activities in the fields of  meteorology, electrical               
              engineering and computer science.  Additionally, each student will             
              be assigned to and work with a senior professional on a topic                  
              matched as closely as possible with the students interest.  Partial            
              support for this effort will be provided by the National Oceanic               
              and Atmospheric Administration.
