Abstract    :
              This research addresses the learning of a concept class in the                 
              exact learning model.  This concept class, the set of k-quasi                  
              Horn sentences, has crucial significance in both models:  it                   
              is known that if k-quasi Horn sentences are shown to be                        
              learnable in the exact learning model, then (under some                        
              general cryptographic assumptions) the large class of                          
              conjunctive normal form sentences are predictable in the PAC                   
              model.  Partial research has shown that k-quasi Horn sentences                 
              are indeed learnable when the exact learning model is                          
              augmented with somewhat more power.  This line of research                     
              will be continued to obtain a definitive answer about the                      
              learnability of k-quasi Horn sentences in the exact learning                   
              model.
