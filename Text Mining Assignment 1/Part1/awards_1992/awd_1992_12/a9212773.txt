Abstract    :
                   This grant is for partial support of the seventh meeting                  
              of the APS division of particles and fields.  This conference                  
              is in a series of meetings, the last of which was in                           
              Vancouver, Canada in August 1991.  It provides a forum for the                 
              presentation of the latest results in High Energy Physics, in                  
              both plenary and parallel sessions.  It encourages the                         
              participation of young workers in the field, and as such                       
              provides some visibility for the work of graduate students and                 
              post docs.
