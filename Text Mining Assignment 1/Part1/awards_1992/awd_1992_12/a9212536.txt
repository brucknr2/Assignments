Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This effort explores mechanisms of precipitate coarsening in metal             
              alloys that contain low volume fractions of precipitates.  The                 
              mechanisms of precipitate coarsening and associated effects of                 
              elastic strain are important areas in physical metallurgy that                 
              needs to be resolved. Four binary alloys have been selected for                
              this study to provide a range of lattice mismatches, from a low of             
              0.003 in the nickel/silicon system to a high of 0.0112 in the                  
              nickel/germanium system.  The effects of elastic interaction and               
              volume fraction of precipitate on particle coarsening and                      
              equilibrium shape are examined.  The kinetics of coarsening are                
              followed using the techniques of transmission electron microscopy              
              and magnetic analysis, which enables measurement of the solute                 
              concentration in the Ni-rich matrix during coarsening.  Magnetron              
              sputtering is explored as a means of preparing alloys of precisely             
              controlled compositions and homogeneity.

              This research has relevance to microstructural formation and                   
              stability in high temperature metal alloys.  The emphasis is on                
              binary nickel-base alloys, the principal base for superalloy                   
              compositions development.
