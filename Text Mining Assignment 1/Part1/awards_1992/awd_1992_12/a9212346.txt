Abstract    :
              Liu         Wave pipelining techniques have a good potential to improve  the
              performance of a digital system design.  The success of  achieving CMOS wave
              pipelining requires a design methodology  which tightly couples the knowledge
              of technology, process,  circuit, logic, and system architecture design as well
              as CAD  tools for design and testing.  While preliminary results have  clearly
              demonstrated the feasibility of wave pipelining in CMOS,  more work is needed
              toward the efficient design of wave pipelined  systems.  This project is to
              develop and demonstrate design  techniques and VLSI structures for wave
              pipelining based on CMOS  technology, primarily because of its wide
              availability and  relatively low cost.  Useful application areas for wave 
              pipelining in high speed systems include high speed sampling  circuitry,
              digital phase locked loops, MUX and DEMUX, error  correction circuits, data and
              clock recovery for fiber optics.
