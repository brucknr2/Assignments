Abstract    :
              The Department of Electrical and Computer                                      
              Engineering, University of California, San                                     
              Diego, will purchase an optical spectrum                                       
              analyzer, together with an RF phase noise                                      
              test-set from Hewlett Packard, which will be                                   
              dedicated to support research in Electrical                                    
              and Communications Systems                                                     
              Engineering.  The equipment will be used                                       
              for many interdisciplinary research projects                                   
              at UCSD involving photonics components                                         
              and system research, including in particular                                   
              (a) high speed, large bandwidth, large                                         
              dynamic range waveguide devices, (b)                                           
              planar, monolithic and array integration of                                    
              high performance photonic devices, (c) a                                       
              wideband traveling-wave waveguide                                              
              photodetector, (d) hybrid optical transmitter                                  
              at high center frequency, (e) dielectric                                       
              properties of multiple quantum wells.                                          
              These projects, based on a synergy                                             
              between optoelectric material, devices, and                                    
              system, will lead to higher performance                                        
              fiber optic communication systems.  The                                        
              equipment requested will be jointly funded                                     
              by NSF and UCSD with additional                                                
              maintenance funds from research                                                
              programs sponsored by the Defense                                              
              Department and industry.
