Abstract    :
              This research seeks to design, develop and implement a system of               
              magnetostrictive actuators for sensing and control of structural               
              vibrations. The system will employ adaptive control algorithms in              
              local and global feedback configurations to  minimize vibrations               
              in various dynamic environments. Investigations to support the                 
              design and implementation will include frequency response                      
              studies, force nonlinearities, and hysteresis effects. The effort              
              is motivated in part by the availability of magnetostrictive                   
              materials that can provide higher counter  forces and strains as               
              compared to piezoelectric materials. In that the results of this               
              research will generate new knowledge concerning employment of                  
              magnetostrictive materials in vibration control applications, it               
              should serve to advance the overall field of vibration control                 
              methodologies.***//
