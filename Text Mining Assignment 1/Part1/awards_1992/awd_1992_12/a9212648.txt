              of a conference on "Visualization                                              
              in Biomedical Computing" which will                                            
              be held in October, 1992 at the

              namely, 1) Theory and Algorithms,                                              
              2) Tools and Systems for Biomedical                                            
              Visualization, and 3) Applications                                             
              of Visualization in Medicine and                                               
              Biology. The goal of the conference                                            
              is to define emerging areas in the                                             
              biomedical imaging field.  The                                                 
              conference, because of its                                                     
              multidisciplinary character, should                                            
              help focus new  research on topics                                             
              needed to advance the biomedical                                               
              imaging field.
