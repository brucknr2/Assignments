Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  An enormous carbonate megabank formed and thrived on the                  
              Nicaragua Rise in the Oligocene and early/middle Miocene, portions             
              of which form the segmented platform/basin geometry seen today.                
              Current intensification caused by this platform blocking the                   
              northward flow of the Caribean Current resulted in widespread                  
              unconformities in the Florida-Bahamas region.  The present study               
              will connect three previous study sites by a network of high-                  
              resolution seismic profiles.  Dredging of exposed outcrops and                 
              piston coring will provide samples of the older substrata.                     
              Eventually an ODP drilling program will be proposed for the                    
              Nicaragua Rise, based partly on the results of this program.
