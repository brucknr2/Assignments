Abstract    :
              This study investigates the fitness benefits of extra-pair                     
              fertilizations to both females and males in a marked population of             
              singly-paired-bonded, territorial, dispersed nesting birds with                
              biparental care of offspring.  Predictions that females gain                   
              material and genetic benefits from the males with whom they mate               
              surreptitiously and that males are more likely to pursue extra-pair            
              fertilizations when they are least likely to reduce fitness with               
              their pair-bonded females.  This study will combine field                      
              observations of behavior, song analysis, and estimation of                     
              reproductive success from biochemically assessed parentage using               
              short tandem repeats in DNA base pairs to identifying highly                   
              polymorphic Mendelian loci.  The study brings a highly original                
              blending of population analysis and molecular biological assessment            
              of relatedness on issues of general importance in addressing                   
              practical problems of species survival of wild birds.
