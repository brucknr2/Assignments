Abstract    :
                   This work will address a variety of theoretical subjects                  
              related to or inspired by the collision of high energy heavy-                  
              ions; including a model for studying cluster distributions,                    
              correlations and fluctuations; a model for hadronizing the                     
              quark-gluon plasma in analogy to ferromagnetic phase                           
              transitions; and exactly solvable statistical mechanics models                 
              of fragmentation.
