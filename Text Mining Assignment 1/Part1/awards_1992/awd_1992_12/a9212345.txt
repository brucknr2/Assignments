Abstract    :
                   This award is for computer equipment to augment that in the               
              Center for Electronic Packaging Research of the Department of                  
              Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Arizona.  The               
              equipment will enable the Center, which is well staffed to carry               
              out research in electronic packaging, to continue to move into the             
              emerging area of computer-aided Very Large Scaled Integration                  
              interconnection design and analysis.  The equipment will facilitate            
              the development and testing of a large scale software system                   
              involving both numerical and symbolic processing.
