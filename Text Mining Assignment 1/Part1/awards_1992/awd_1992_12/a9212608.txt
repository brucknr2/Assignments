Abstract    :
                   This award supports research on several problems of finite                
              p-groups, pro-p-groups, and infinite dimensional Lie algebras.                 
              All these problems are related to infinite-dimensional Lie                     
              algebras satisfying a polynomial identity and to Lie algebras                  
              with Engel's condition.                                                        
                   This research is concerned with a mathematical object called              
              a Lie algebra.  Lie algebras arise from another object called a                
              Lie group.  An example of a Lie group is the rotations of a                    
              sphere where one rotation is followed by another.  Lie groups and              
              Lie algebras are important in areas involving analysis of                      
              spherical motion.
