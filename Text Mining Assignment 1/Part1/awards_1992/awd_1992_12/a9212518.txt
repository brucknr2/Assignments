Abstract    :
              This equipment grant will be used for acquisition of a laser                   
              diagnostics imaging system for research important to                           
              development of better understanding and modeling of turbulent                  
              combustion.  This system, which employs an intensified CCD                     
              camera and an aberration-corrected monochromator in a two-                     
              dimensional multiplexed detection scheme to simultaneously                     
              detect spectral and spatial information, greatly reduces data                  
              acquisition time for characterization of strained laminar                      
              flames by enabling the acquisition of simultaneous spectra at                  
              multiple locations in such  flames, removing the need for                      
              spatial scanning.                                                              
                                                                                             
              This imaging equipment will play a key role in a comprehensive                 
              program to construct and test "libraries" of experimentally                    
              measured properties of strained laminar flamelets for use in                   
              turbulent combustion modeling and engine simulations.  Such                    
              data is currently being collected using non-intrusive laser                    
              diagnostics to measure spatially resolved temperature,                         
              velocity, and species concentration profiles in well-                          
              controlled counterflowing premixed diffusion flames; however,                  
              the current research is hampered by the massive amount of data                 
              required for each "library" and the time required to obtain                    
              it. (For a given fuel, measurements are required for a wide                    
              range of strain rates, pressures, temperatures, and                            
              equivalence ratios.)  This improvement will make possible the                  
              construction of experimental laminar flamelet libraries for                    
              accurate modeling of turbulent combustion of realistic fuels                   
              for which kinetic schemes are not yet available.
