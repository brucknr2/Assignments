Abstract    :
              This project documents the history of laws and policies concerning             
              immigration to colonial America.  It locates this history in its               
              broad global context, advancing the general notion that immigration            
              involves not only the interests and goals of the receiving nation,             
              but also those of the sending countries, and the complex interplay             
              between receiving and sending nations.  Specifically, the project              
              catalogs significant restrictions on immigration to North America              
              in the colonial period of 1607 to 1763.  It demonstrates that these            
              restrictions were not simply local phenomena, but are the result               
              of serious policy disputes between the metropolitan center of the              
              British Empire and its colonial periphery.                                     
                                                                                             
              To document this history and advance the thesis that early                     
              immigration laws are a by-product of tensions between the center               
              and the periphery, the investigator uses a combination of statutory            
              research and historical methods, including the full record of                  
              primary and secondary sources located in the U.S. and abroad. In               
              addition to filling an important gap in knowledge about the early              
              foundations of U.S. immigration law, it contributes to the broader             
              theme that law formation may be studied as a dynamic between                   
              domestic/local interests and goals on the one hand, and external               
              attempts to impose or transplant interests and goals on the other.
