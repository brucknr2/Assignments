Abstract    :
              This award, of $390,000, is for support of a Center for Education              
              Research  Infrastructure Development in Microelectromechanical                 
              Systems.  The mission of the center is to develop model                        
              interdisciplinary educational programs and resources in                        
              microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) which interact  with and                 
              support a coordinated and focused MEMS research program.  The core             
              of the proposed program is a team of four faculty members from                 
              Materials Science, Electrical Engineering, and Mechanical                      
              Engineering, whose interests and expertise span most of MEMS                   
              technology. The educational efforts include course development,                
              project/research involvement of graduate and undergradaute                     
              students, seminars, and interaction and outreach to industry and               
              other educational institutions.  The research component of the                 
              program consists of several projects which are focused on the                  
              common goal of developing an integrated MEMS technology in which               
              all major elements (microactuators, microsensors, micromechanical              
              devices, and on-chip electronics) can be compatibly fabricated on              
              a common substrate.
