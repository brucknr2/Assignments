Abstract    :
                   This research is designed to investigate the dynamics of                  
              change at the molecular level.  It uses the enzyme phosphoglucose              
              isomerase in the genus Colias (the sulphur butterfly) as an                    
              experimental model.  The major focus of this research involves a               
              comparison of PGI DNA sequences within and between species of                  
              Colias and related genera.  Sequence changes will then be                      
              interpreted in relation to three dimensional structural information            
              on PGI, the phylogenetic relationships of the butterflies involved,            
              and previous studies on Colias PGI.  In addition, this information             
              will be used to address relationships within the Coliadinae, which             
              includes Colias.  One of the potential real benefits of the                    
              proposed research is that a more accurate picture of selective                 
              forces on PGI associated with the structure and function of this               
              protein will be obtained.
