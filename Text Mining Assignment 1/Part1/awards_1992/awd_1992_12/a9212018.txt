Abstract    :
               Given a multicomputer program, its input and target  architecture, we want to
              predict the synchronization strategy  resulting in the fastest simulation of
              the program.  Simulators are often present in environments facilitating 
              parallel program design.  In addition, they are used to  compare the
              performance of different parallel architectures on  a given program.  In both
              instances, speeding up the  simulator's execution decreases development time of
              parallel  programs.  The major emphasis of this research is on comparing
              different  synchronization strategies for multicomputer simulations.  The 
              project will proceed in two stages.  First, a simple  multicomputer simulation
              paradigm having a few communication  primitives and a simple timing model will
              be used. Methods for  predicting the execution times for this paradigm using
              both  analytical and empirical techniques will be developed.  Together with
              sequential simulation, a variety of parallel  synchronization strategies, such
              as synchronous, time-driven,  asynchronous, and hybrid strategies will be
              considered.  Second, more complex multicomputer simulators, including 
              additional communication primitives and more complex timing  models will be
              investigated.
