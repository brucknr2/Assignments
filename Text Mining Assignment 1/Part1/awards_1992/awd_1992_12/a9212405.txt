Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Nervous systems encode and transmit information in the form of                 
              electrical signals.  At a cellular level, electrical impulses are              
              generated and modulated by a class of proteins that form ion                   
              channels.  One class of ion channel proteins that form calcium-                
              activated potassium channels, will be studied.  The PI has cloned              
              the gene, slowpoke, that codes for these channels in the fruit fly.            
              A number of different mRNA transcripts that code for slightly                  
              different proteins are coded for by this gene.  Using molecular                
              techniques, a high resolution map of the tissue and developmental              
              expression of each of the gene products of slowpoke in the nervous             
              system of the fruit fly will be generated.  This will be correlated            
              with the biophysical properties of the channels produced.  In                  
              addition, mutations in slowpoke which result in a unique 'sticky               
              feet' phenotypic behavior will be used to develop genetic screens              
              to identify other genes that control slowpoke gene expression.                 
              These studies promise to provide important information on the                  
              molecular signals controlling expression of proteins that form ion             
              channels in nerve cells.  Such information will be relevant to                 
              understanding development and function in the nervous systems of               
              both invertebrates and vertebrates, including human.
