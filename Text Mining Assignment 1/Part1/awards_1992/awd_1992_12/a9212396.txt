Abstract    :
              Theoretical studies will be conducted on the dynamics of complex               
              nonequilibrium systems with many degrees of freedom focusing on                
              systems which exhibit nontrivial scaling properties.  A central                
              aspect of this work involves a general formulation consisting of               
              singular diffusion limits.  Issues to be addressed include                     
              universality, deterministic versus stochastic dynamics, field                  
              theoretic techniques, the role of conservation laws, origins of the            
              separation of time scales, and the breakdown of hydrodynamics in               
              certain systems.  Specific applications of these concepts will be              
              applied to problems in seismology, fracture, friction and solid                
              state physics.                                                                 
              %%%                                                                            
              Research will be conducted on both general concepts and specific               
              applications of self-organized criticality.  This is a theory for              
              such common events as avalanches of sandpiles which may have a                 
              profound impact on fundamental physics and nonlinear science, and              
              yet may have wide-spread application to a variety of real problems             
              including earthquakes, friction and fracture.
