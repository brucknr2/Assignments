              The titanium sapphire laser will be                                            
              used for several research projects:                                            
              a) measurement of the linear and

              our Riber 32P MBE machine, for                                                 
              example, strained-layer InGaAs/GaAs                                            
              multiple quantum wells, in order to                                            
              assess their potential for low-                                                
              energy optical modulators and low-                                             
              threshold lasers; b) study of                                                  
              spectral hole burning and

              the nonlinear properties of specific                                           
              MBE-grown devices such as our
