Abstract    :
              This renewal grant is for an ongoing study of correlated lattice               
              electron systems.  The viewpoint is that of self-consistent-field              
              approximations and parquet theory.  This allows the generalization             
              of Hartree-Fock theory to systems having strong correlation and                
              large electronic fluctuations.  This provides a semi-analytical                
              alternative (and test) for numerical techniques like exact                     
              diagonalization or simulation.  In addition to development of                  
              renormalization group techniques for this class of theory, various             
              issues concerned with superconductivity and charge-density ordering            
              in strongly correlated materials (such as high-Tc superconductors)             
              will be studied.                                                               
              %%%                                                                            
              The electronic structure of solids determines most, if not all, of             
              the common properties of materials on which present and future                 
              technology is based.  However, there are large classes of materials            
              for which our present understanding is quite limited.  One such                
              class is strongly correlated materials (including high-Tc                      
              superconductors), in which the forces between electrons are very               
              stong.  This grant funds a project intended to extend to this new              
              class of materials a group of theoretical techniques which allow               
              the properties of normal systems to be understood.
