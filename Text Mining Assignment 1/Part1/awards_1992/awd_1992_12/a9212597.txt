Abstract    :
                   This is the first year funding of a three-year continuing                 
              award IRI-9212597.  Several problems are to be investigated in the             
              continuation of research on information-based complexity:  weak and            
              strong tractability of multivariate problems, weak and strong                  
              optimal information, verification, and computational learning                  
              theory/information-based complexity for continuous problems.  In               
              the first two problems, breaking intractability and unsolvability              
              of multivariate problems are explored in various settings.  The                
              concepts of strong tractability and strong optimal information are             
              introduced.  For strongly tractable problems the dependence on the             
              number of variables is eliminated.  The third problem is                       
              verification.  Surprisingly, for continuous problems, verification             
              can be exponentially harder than computation.  Finally, it has been            
              observed that there are parallels between computational learning               
              theory and information-based complexity.  Research is conducted on             
              the similarities and differences between these two areas for                   
              continuous problems.//
