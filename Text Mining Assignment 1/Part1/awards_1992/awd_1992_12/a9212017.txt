Abstract    :
              This project analyzes the management of Utah Highway 210 with                  
              respect to avalanche danger.  The occurrence of an avalanche                   
              crossing the road is a low-probability, high-risk event.                       
              Avalanche hazard is managed both by active control (explosives)                
              and by passive control (road closures).  The study emphasizes the              
              road closure decision.  The probability of an avalanche crossing               
              the road is modeled through logistic regression.  The decision to              
              close the road, however, reflects a highly asymmetric loss                     
              function.  Closing the road when no avalanche occurs is very                   
              costly, but does not compare to the effects of failing to close                
              the road when an avalanche does in fact occur.  This feature of                
              the problem is incorporated into the analysis using an asymmetric              
              loss function. Decisions to close the road are scored against                  
              actual avalanche occurrence by means of a proper scoring rule and              
              this performance is contrasted with that of professional                       
              avalanche forecasters currently managing the road.  The                        
              possibility of augmenting the current practice with statistical                
              analysis is evaluated.  The results of the project are                         
              generalized to other decision making problems involving quantal                
              forecasting under asymmetric loss. Asymmetric loss is a common                 
              problem with low-probability, high risk events.
