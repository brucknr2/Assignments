Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Funded by an Engineering Research Equipment Grant, equipment                   
              will be purchased for use in an investigation of turbulence in                 
              sediment-laden flows.  Grid-generated turbulence in a fluid-                   
              particle medium will be explored with a laser-Doppler                          
              velocimeter capable of measuring instantaneous fluid and                       
              particle velocities.  The particles will be matched to the                     
              fluid with the same index of refraction.                                       
                                                                                             
              Suspension of particulates occur in a variety of flow                          
              applications in the civil and environmental engineering area.
