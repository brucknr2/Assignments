Abstract    :
              This proposal is a request for the continuation of a 1 year 1991               
              award.  We propose to use data obtained from the coordinated GEM               
              data campaigns to test and refine the open-magnetosphere model of              
              Toffoletto and Hill ?1989! with respect to the mapping of the                  
              magnetospheric cusp to low altitude.  The model provides                       
              quantitative predictions of the local time extent and location of              
              the equatorward boundary of the cusp and the direction and                     
              strength of ionospheric convection as functions of the cross-                  
              polar-cap potential, IMF direction and solar wind dynamic                      
              pressure.  The equatorward boundary of the cusp is provisionally               
              defined as the ionospheric footprint of that portion of the                    
              dayside merging line that lies sunward of the magnetosheath sonic              
              line.                                                                          
              We plan to do model-data comparisons as a means of testing the                 
              model's assumptions and boundary conditions; this test will                    
              provide a guide for setting an agenda for model improvements,                  
              some of which are currently under development.  Ultimately, we                 
              expect to develop a model of cusp ion precipitation, calculated                
              by tracing a distribution of particles from the dayside merging                
              line to ionospheric altitude within the large-scale magnetic and               
              electric fields specified by the model.
