Abstract    :
              The primary objective of the                                                   
              Research Initiation Award research                                             
              is to demonstrate the measurement of                                           
              evanescent optical fields with                                                 
              nanometer scale spatial resolution.                                            
              To achieve this goal, a new concept                                            
              and approach has been invented.  The                                           
              approach is based upon the direct                                              
              detection of local variations in                                               
              optical field intensity by a silicon                                           
              photodector probe of nanometer size.                                           
              The probe is raster scanned in close                                           
              proximity to an optically                                                      
              illuminated surface and the                                                    
              photoresponse of the probe is                                                  
              measured and recorded at each point.                                           
              This information is electronically                                             
              displayed in a manner similar to                                               
              that of a Scanning Tunnelling                                                  
              Microscope.  The resultant image                                               
              represents the local optical field                                             
              intensity at each point on the                                                 
              illuminated sample surface.  The                                               
              achievement of this goal will                                                  
              require the design and development                                             
              of a new silicon nanoprobe and the                                             
              demonstration of the novel concept                                             
              of "Near Field Photodection Optical                                            
              Microscopy".  The second objective                                             
              is to explore the use of this new                                              
              nanoprobe for doing local optical                                              
              spectroscopy on the nanometer scale.                                           
              This will be accomplished by                                                   
              focusing a tunable optical source                                              
              onto a surface which has                                                       
              heterogeneous optical properties.                                              
              The nanoprobe is positioned in close                                           
              proximity to a specific sample                                                 
              feature and the nanoprobe                                                      
              photoresponse is measured as the                                               
              frequency of the illumination source                                           
              is tuned over a given frequency                                                
              range.  The measured photoresponse                                             
              as a function of frequency is a                                                
              spectroscopic fingerprint which                                                
              should allow identification of                                                 
              chemical or molecular species at the                                           
              sample surface with nanometer scale                                            
              resolution.
