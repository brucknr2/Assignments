Abstract    :
              This project will investigate the view of                                      
              genetic algorithms (GAs) in                                                    
              reinforcement learning problems.  In                                           
              particular, the research deals with using                                      
              GAs to specify connectionist or neural                                         
              network (NN) systems for such                                                  
              problems.  An analogy between the                                              
              principle GA-based machine learning                                            
              paradigm, learning classifier systems                                          
              (LCSs), and neural learning paradigms                                          
              suggests the proposed avenue of                                                
              research.  Using the analogy, extensive                                        
              experience with genetics-based machine                                         
              learning in LCSs can be directly                                               
              transferred to a larger body of                                                
              connectionist learning architectures.                                          
              The proposal outlines a range of such                                          
              architectures, and experiments designed                                        
              to evaluate  performance of these                                              
              architectures under various                                                    
              reinforcement learning conditions.  The                                        
              proposed research differs from typical                                         
              NN/GA studies, in that most studies                                            
              consider a population of NNs with a                                            
              GA applied to tuning connection                                                
              weights.  This proposal suggests an                                            
              LCS-inspired approach, where the GA                                            
              determines connections within a single                                         
              NN, by forming new hidden units.  The                                          
              GA's population-oriented search process                                        
              is well suited to this task.  The                                              
              proposed work has two goals:  to refine                                        
              understanding of evolutionary-                                                 
              connectionist systems, and to suggest                                          
              methods for integrating such systems                                           
              into workable reinforcement learning                                           
              controllers.
