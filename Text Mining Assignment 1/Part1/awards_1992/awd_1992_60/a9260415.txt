Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This research will develop direct micromechanical simulation                   
              techniques to model damage accumulation in composite materials.                
              Tools will be developed that are capable of evaluating the                     
              composite material deformation, fracture, damage accumulation and              
              failure based on the underlying microstructural defects and the                
              evolution of the microstructural state under multiaxial loading.               
              These simulations will establish a direct relationship between                 
              the evolution of the microdamage accumulation and the loss of                  
              load-carrying capability of the bulk composite material.
