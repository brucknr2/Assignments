Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                                                                                             
                                                                                            
              Ocean ambient sound is known to depend on wind speed, and ambient              
              sound measurements alone are known to produce accurate wind speed              
              estimates up to speeds of around 15m/s.  Ambient sound is not often            
              used to obtain wind data, however, because most investigators need             
              wind velocity, not just speed alone.                                           
                                                                                             
              This effort will combine ambient sound with ADCP (acoustic Doppler             
              Current Profiler).  The ADCP data will provide wind direction with             
              data from surface depth cell.  The ADCP will also estimate near-               
              surface bubble concentrations which will provide a basis for                   
              extending accurate wind speed measurements beyond 15 m/s.                      
                                                                                             
              The same instrument will work for measuring precipitation rates                
              and, as a stand-alone sensor, for general research in ocean ambient            
              sound.
