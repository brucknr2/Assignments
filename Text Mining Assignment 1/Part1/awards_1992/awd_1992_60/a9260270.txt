Abstract    :
                   For imaging or position-sensitive detection (particle                     
              counting) of low-intensity electron, ion, or photon beams, a                   
              common approach is to use a microchannel plate (MCP)                           
              intensifier (with an appropriate emissive coating or                           
              photocathode if necessary) followed by a position-sensitive                    
              anode.  Of several possible anode designs, one which has                       
              proven to be rugged, inexpensive, and very useful,                             
              particularly when timing of individual particle arrivals is                    
              important, is the resistive anode encoder (RAE).                               
                   Present limitations of this device include limited                        
              maximum counting rate due to RC delays and electronic                          
              processing times, and the need to use high voltage vacuum                      
              feedthroughs and breakdown-prone standoff capacitors on the                    
              signal leads for in-situ vacuum applications where the anode                   
              must be biased to high voltages.  A fast new generation of                     
              RAE-type detectors will be developed.  Proposed new pulse                      
              processing electronics, applicable to existing RAE devices as                  
              well, should increase the signal rate over that of current                     
              detectors by a factor of ten.  The new detector would replace                  
              the resistive anode with its optical analog, using a                           
              scintillating lightguide to convert an electron burst into                     
              optical pulses, which can be transmitted over optical fiber                    
              signal leads.  The advantages include inherent high speed,                     
              noise immunity, and non-conducting signal leads that allow the                 
              detector to float at high voltage.
