Abstract    :
              Thermoplastics are not widely used in polar regions because they               
              embrittle and may lose 70% of their fracture toughness at low                  
              temperature.  MCF Foam structure is created by induced                         
              thermodynamic instability in plastics supersaturated with inert gas            
              (non-CFC).  The resulting cell structure incorporates 109 to 1015              
              void per cm3, at a size of 0.3 to 20 microns.  MCF thermoplastics              
              have shown better fracture toughness, impact strength and fatigue              
              in tests at room temperature.  The research will focus in three                
              areas.  Morphology and physical properties will be quantified for              
              several polymers under varying process parameters, including                   
              supersaturation, nucleation, skin thickness and cell size.  If                 
              feasibility is demonstrated, MCF thermoplastics could replace                  
              metals and composites in polar region construction where low-cost,             
              light-weight, rigid structural materials are required.
