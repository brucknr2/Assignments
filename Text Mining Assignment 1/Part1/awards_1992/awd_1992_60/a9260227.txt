Abstract    :
              This project outlines a research plan for the development of a                 
              sensor to measure supersaturation activity in solution.  The sensor            
              consists of a tube chamber which is immersed in the solution and               
              which is filled with a buffer solution containing a probe molecule             
              pyranine.  One side of the chamber consists of a ion exchange                  
              membrane which allows for the selective transport of protons from              
              the exterior solution into the chamber, but does not allow the                 
              transport of the probe molecule out into the solution.  The proton             
              concentration determines the equilibrium between the protonated and            
              unprotonated forms of pyranine.  The chamber is irradiated by UV               
              light through a fiber optic inserted into the chamber.  The                    
              radiation excites both protonated and unprotonated forms of the                
              molecule, causing emission of the protonated form at 440 nm and of             
              the unprotonated form at 511 nm.  The ration of the intensities at             
              these two wavelengths is a function of the ratio of the ratio of               
              the two molecular forms, and this in turn characterizes the proton             
              concentration in the chamber (and presumably in the solution).  The            
              intensities are measured using a second fiber optic immersed in the            
              chamber and connected to a photodiode detector.                                
                                                                                             
              This sensor will be used to measure supersaturation.  Recent                   
              evidence for source indicates that the concentration level affects             
              the proton availability.  In particular, previous research reviewed            
              in the proposal demonstrates that the emission intensities of the              
              protonated form of the molecular increases with sucrose                        
              concentration, while that of the unprotonated form decreases with              
              increasing sucrose concentration.
