Abstract    :
              This project explores improved and expanded methods that allow                 
              optical crossbar switches to be used more effectively in multiple              
              switch mesh networks over large distances.  The primary research               
              objective is to develop new control methods for wide area optical              
              network (WAON) configurations using the techniques of packet                   
              switching, global status tables and out-of-band control.  The                  
              anticipated results of the work include the ability to expand the              
              size (number of nodes) and extent (distance between nodes) of                  
              supercomputer networks tasked to solve large scale computing                   
              problems.  Applications include gigabit LANs, supercomputer                    
              networks, and avionics networks.
