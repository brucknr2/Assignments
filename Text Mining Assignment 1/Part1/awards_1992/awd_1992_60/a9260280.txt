Abstract    :
                   Innovations in the manufacture of a very widely used                      
              electronic component, the circuit board, are considered.  In                   
              particular, fast photographic systems which would promote the use              
              of computer-controlled direct-write laser techniques are                       
              introduced.  The project concerns two advancements in direct-write             
              circuit board fabrication.  The first advancement involves the use             
              of techniques developed for integrated circuit microlithograhpy to             
              achieve increased photo-resist speed and a wider spectral range of             
              the laser direct-write exposure sources.  The second advancement               
              seeks to do away with photo-resist step by using a direct-write                
              conducting wiring board pattern, followed by chemical and physical             
              development and copper plating.  The research will evaluate the                
              feasibility of the concepts.                                                   
                   Successful implementation of the concepts would enable mask-              
              free direct-writing of circuit boards at high throughput rates,                
              typically five square feet per minute with five micron resolution.             
              The potential impact on small batch and prototype board markets is             
              high.
