Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project                 
              has as its objective the design of a multimedia mathematics                    
              learning environment for grades K-8.  The software system                      
              envisioned would be complementary to a new math textbook series                
              from Addison-Wesley that follows the new National Council of                   
              Teachers of Mathematics (NCTM) math standards for the reform of                
              mathematics teaching and learning.  The software would provide                 
              interactive simulations embedded in problem-solving and open-                  
              ended exploratory contexts and would enable the encouragement of               
              theme-based projects, investigations, and hands-on mathematics.
