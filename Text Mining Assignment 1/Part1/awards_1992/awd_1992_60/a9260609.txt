Abstract    :
              Mega Marine Structures, Inc. manufactures an innovative fiber-                 
              reinforced-polymer honeycomb (FRPH) having promising structural                
              applications.  Once it can be qualified, this high-strength,                   
              light-weight, non-corrosive, tough, resilient, and highly                      
              producible FRPH-an industrial-grade macro-honeycomb--could                     
              achieve significant cost, labor, and weight reductions in ocean                
              structures.  Compared to FRP ocean structures, FRPH structural                 
              systems have a much higher strength-to-weight ratio, the prospect              
              for greatly reduced construction costs, and the capability of                  
              being thoroughly instrumented for the purpose of non-destructive               
              evaluation (NDE).                                                              
                                                                                             
              This research effort will construct test panels of FRPH,                       
              instrumented with strain gauges and acoustic sensors, and conduct              
              NDE acoustic emission (AE) and physical load testing.  During                  
              testing, failures will be induced to determine the utility of AE               
              for studying FRPH failure modes, failure sequence, failure                     
              monitoring, and incipient failure onset.  These are key                        
              ingredients toward making FRPH an accepted engineering material                
              within a short period of time.
