Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The resolution and overlay accuracy needed for advanced                        
              semiconductor manufacturing has tightened about 30% every two and              
              one-half years.  Current design rules lie near or below the                    
              actual wavelength of visible light.  Therefore, optical tools for              
              pattern generation are now supplemented by new technologies such               
              as X-ray and electron beam exposure systems.                                   
                                                                                             
              Manufacture of devices under a sub-half micron design rule                     
              requires patten overlay control to an accuracy more severe than                
              ever before.  The task is complicated by the mix of new                        
              lithography tools, which may employ dissimilar technologies, but               
              nevertheless must be calibrated and integrated.  So far, the most              
              successful approach has been to model the distortions of printed               
              patterns against the parameters of the lens and alignment                      
              systems.  However, new and stronger methods are needed.                        
                                                                                             
              This SBIR Phase I research explores an expert system for process               
              overlay control.  Called the Lithographic Imaging METrology                    
              (LIMET) module, the LIMET-expert uses new techniques to provide                
              the modeling and statistical experience available to customize                 
              models and algorithms.  LIMET-expert has application in the real-              
              time control and maintenance of the process as well as the                     
              pattern generation equipment.
