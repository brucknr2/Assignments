Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The feasibility of diamond ceramics has been demonstrated at                   
              Crystallume by consolidating diamond powder with CVD diamond to                
              near full density producing disks of several millimeter thickness.             
              In this study, we will develop a high toughness diamond matrix                 
              composite in collaboration with the University of California,                  
              Berkeley.  Samples will be fabricated at Crystallume in which cubic            
              boron nitride powder is incorporated in a CVD diamond matrix for               
              enhancing toughness.  Mechanical testing will be performed at the              
              Materials Science and Mineral Engineering Department, University of            
              California, Berkeley, to examine fatigue and fracture properties.              
              The results of this study will provide the basis for optimizing                
              diamond composite microstructures in Phase II for wear and cutting             
              applications.  This new material can be processed in useful shapes             
              and will exhibit superior hardness, exceptional toughness, and high            
              thermal conductivity.                                                          
                                                                                             
              A high toughness diamond composite will be of considerable interest            
              in abrasive wear and cutting tool applications.  The proposed work             
              will provide a new material which can be produced in useful shapes             
              and will not require a wear-resistant coating.  Products may                   
              include tool inserts, bearing elements, and structural components.
