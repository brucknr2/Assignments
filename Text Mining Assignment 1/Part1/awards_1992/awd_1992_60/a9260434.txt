Abstract    :
                  Head mounted display systems (HMDS) are recognized as a                    
              valuable tool for synthetic environment simulations.  To maintain              
              an image of reality, the ideal system should be stereographic and              
              capable of immediate real-time response to computer-or camera-                 
              generated imagery.  Unfortunately, stereoscopy has a number of                 
              inherent weaknesses.  Gross misjudgments of distance, velocity, and            
              shape occur if unrestrained head motion is permitted, without real-            
              time regeneration of a matching stereo pair.  Volume approach is a             
              good solution, and has a much stronger potential for producing a               
              good device for synthetic imaging than does stereoscopic approach.             
              Using recent advances in image processing techniques and in LCD                
              development, Physical Optics Corporation (POC) proposes a novel                
              volume visualization display.  POC uses a computer-stored image of             
              a simulated 3-D scene and then rearranges it as a set of 2-D cross             
              sections (slices).  The display will have a corresponding set of               
              "switchable" layers, whose state can be instantaneously changed                
              from transparent to scattering.  POC's device will have full see-              
              through capability.  A lightweight, full color volume visualization            
              HMDS prototype will be demonstrated in Phase II.//
