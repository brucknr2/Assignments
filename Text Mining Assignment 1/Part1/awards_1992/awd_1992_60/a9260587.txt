Abstract    :
                   Novel high-performance helium free precession (HFP)                       
              magnetometer is proposed for use in geomagnetic field                          
              measurements and magnetic geophysical exploration.  We propose in              
              Phase I to define a concept for a portable laser-pumped helium                 
              3 magnetometer which has small size, high sensitivity and low                  
              power consumption.  The key technical component is a miniature                 
              tunable near-infrared laser pump source developed by Polatomic                 
              for NASA use in a helium 4 space magnetometer.  The laser pumping              
              light and sensor read-out will be carried by optical fiber link                
              between the sensor and the laser/electronics package.  During                  
              Phase I we will assess the feasibility of the laser-pumped helium              
              3 magnetometer and optimize the laser pump source for pumping                  
              helium 3.  The concept will be validated in Phase II with the                  
              design, fabrication and testing of a laser-pumped helium 3                     
              magnetometer.  In Phase II two sensors will be built in order to               
              evaluate a laser-pumped helium 3 gradiometer.  If technically                  
              feasible, the laser pumped helium free precession magnetometer                 
              would replace the proton free precession (PFP) magnetometer as                 
              the world standard.  The HFP would provide continuous read-out                 
              and have sensitivity improved by more than an order of magnitude               
              over the PFP.
