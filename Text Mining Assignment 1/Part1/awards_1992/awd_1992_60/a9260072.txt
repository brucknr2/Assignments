Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The objective of the proposed work is to complete a feasibility                
              study on the development and eventual practical application of an              
              advanced software product designed for solving systems of                      
              simultaneous algebraic equations which arise in connection with the            
              p- and hp- versions of the finite element,  utilizing massively                
              parallel computer systems.
