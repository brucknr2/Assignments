Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              An integrated multi-rack read/write head and associated circuitry              
              suitable for high performance (100 MHz), ultra-high density                    
              (2x109 bits/in2) recording will be designed.  The                              
              magnetoresistive sensor wil use Giant Magnetoresistance Ratio                  
              (GMR) material, which provied a much higher signal (about ten                  
              times) compared with standard materials because of higher                      
              magnetoresistance and higher sheet resistivity.  The orientation               
              of the sensor wil be orthogonal to the orientation of the sensors              
              in use today for improved reliability and higher density.  The                 
              associate circuitry will be signed using CMOS on a substrate of                
              Silicon on Sapphire (SOS) which has both favorable wear                        
              capability compared to silicon, and in addition has lower                      
              parasitic capacitances that silicon, hence improving the                       
              electrical performance of the on-chip circuitry.  Sensors for                  
              servo track will be included in the design.  In Phase I the head               
              will be designed, and satisfactory GMR materials will be                       
              demonstrated on a substrate comprised of permalloy shielding                   
              material on SOS.  The read portion on the head designed in Phase               
                                                                                             
              I, except for shields, will be fabricated and demonstrated in                  
              Phase II.
