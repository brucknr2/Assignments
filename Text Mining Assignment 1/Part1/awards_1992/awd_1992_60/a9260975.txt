Abstract    :
              This Phase I SBIR project investigates a new fiber-optics sensing              
              and communications system, Smart Skin Array Technology                         
              (SSAT) which shows promise in detecting and measuring                          
              localized cracks in civil engineering structures caused by                     
              earthquakes.  The proposed approach extends the existing                       
              advantages of fiber optics for sensing to the development of                   
              localized, real time, high reslution surface crack sensing array               
              systems.  Application of such systems would lessen the                         
              need to interrupt facilities' use for maintenance inspection                   
              purposes.  The investigation consists of sample fabrication, testing           
              and analysis to demonstrate technical feasibility within a                     
              laboratory environment.  Also the hardware and software                        
              specifications for data acquisition, recording and display of                  
              cracking events will be developed.
