Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The feasibility of fabricating Nb3Al multifilamentary                          
              superconducting wires through a Jelly-Roll technique using                     
              commercially available aluminum alloy sheets, which contain Mg                 
              and/or Si, will be investigated.  Oxygen free high conductivity                
              copper will be incorporated into the conductor design as the                   
              stabilizer.  The conventional wire fabricating processes with low              
              temperature extrusion will be tested.  The superconducting                     
              properties of the new materials such as Tc or Jc will be measured.             
              The microstructures of the superconducting composite materials will            
              be examined and characterized.  The aim is to develop a                        
              superconducting wire with properties that exceed those of current              
              materials.
