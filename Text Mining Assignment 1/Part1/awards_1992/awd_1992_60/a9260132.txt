Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              High quality, epitaxial TlBaCaCuO films on MgO and sapphire                    
              substrates will be prepared.  However, some problems exist for such            
              epitaxial growth and it is proposed to overcome these difficulties             
              by buffering the substrate using an inert epitaxial layer, which               
              has a close lattice match to the TBCCO structure.  Growth of                   
              epitaxial Tl-based films via an established post deposition                    
              annealing process on top of thin, high quality CeO2 buffer layers              
              will be undertaken.  If successful, this process could replace much            
              of the material currently grown on LaAlO3 for microwave components             
              at high frequencies where frequency settability is a key issue.
