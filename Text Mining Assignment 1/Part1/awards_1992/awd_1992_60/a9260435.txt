Abstract    :
              The primary goal of the proposed research is to develop patentable             
              materials and methodology that would greatly facilitate the                    
              difficult, slow and frequently expensive process of obtaining high             
              quality protein crystals suitable for protein x-ray                            
              crystallography.  The approach to be used involves attaching                   
              protein molecules, in a site-specific manner, to a synthetic core              
              containing four sites of attachment arranged tetrahedrally.  The               
              complex, which now possesses structural symmetry, will be more                 
              prone to crystallization than the individual, inherently                       
              unsymmetrical protein molecules.  The method also has the added                
              advantage of providing for a general appproach to isomorphous                  
              replacement, a frequently necessary but sometimes difficult step in            
              protein crystallography.                                                       
              %%%                                                                            
              Three dimensional protein structures, obtained mostly through x-ray            
              diffraction studies, are extremely valuable in computer-aided                  
              design studies, especially in the fields of protein engineering,               
              pesticide design and drug design and development.  An ancillary                
              benefit of this study includes a possible deepening of our                     
              understanding of life processes in general at the molecular level.
