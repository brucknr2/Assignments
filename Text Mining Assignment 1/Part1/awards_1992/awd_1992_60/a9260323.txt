Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Advanced semiconductor devices require precision process control               
              of layer thickness and doping concentrations during epitaxial                  
              crystal growth.  Mission Research Corporation (MRC) and the                    
              University of New Mexico's (UNM's) Center for High Technology                  
              Materials (CHTM) propose a robust, simple, retrofittable, in-                  
              situ diagnostic for both monitoring and process control that will              
              adapt easily to most epitaxial growth system geometries without                
              major system modifications. This represents and exciting                       
              opportunity to advance to a new level of process contol.  The                  
              proposed system is a potentially high-performance, low-cost,                   
              realtime control system for modern epitaxial growth such as                    
              metalorganic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD) and molecular beam              
              epitaxy (MBE), and may also find application in other CVD                      
              systems.  This type of real-time measurement and control of                    
              epitaxial growth will impact manufacturability and lower device                
              cost by improving precision, throughput and yield.
