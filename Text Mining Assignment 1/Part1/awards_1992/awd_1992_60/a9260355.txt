Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project                 
              has as its purpose the de-mystification of the subject of                      
              ionizing radiation by producing small bottles of superheated                   
              material suspended in a gel which would allow students from                    
              middle school to medical school to "see" radiation and to "test"               
              for it using everyday materials with natural radioactivity.                    
              These portable bubble chambers can be put in a student's pocket.               
              When radiation of sufficient energy (an stopping power) interacts              
              with atoms within the liquid drop, it will suddenly vaporize,                  
              producing a clearly visible bubble and an easily audible "pop."                
              The rate of bubble formation indicates the radiation flux, and                 
              the total bubble production is a measure of total radiation                    
              exposure.                                                                      
                                                                                             
              These kits can also be used in educating the lay public on issues              
              concerning nuclear power, nuclear weapons, and nuclear safety.
