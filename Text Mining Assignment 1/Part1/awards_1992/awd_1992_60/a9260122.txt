Abstract    :
              Photo-induced immobilization will                                              
              be used for the preparation of thin                                            
              pin-hole free chromatographic                                                  
              surfaces whose silanol sites are                                               
              inactivated for use in high

              (HPLC).  To demonstrate this                                                   
              chemical platform technology,                                                  
              surfaces will be prepared and                                                  
              chromatographically evaluated using                                            
              both small and large molecules as                                              
              standard probes.  With judicious                                               
              selection of monomers, new

              prepared, allowing selectivity to

              chemical platform is not dependent

              any surface may be employed thereby

              separation process.  Successful                                                
              completion of Phases I and II will                                             
              provide the technical foundation                                               
              for the commercialization of                                                   
              separation products developed and
