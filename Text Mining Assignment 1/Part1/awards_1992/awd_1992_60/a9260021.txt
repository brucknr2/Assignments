Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Development of a novel optical imaging system for studies of the               
              nervous system is proposed.  The concept is based on the use of                
              acousto-optic tunable filters as spectral selection elements in a              
              confocal fluorescence microscope.  In conjunction with the use of              
              multiply labeled specimens the proposed instrument will permit                 
              investigation of neurochemistry-specific three-dimensional                     
              architecture of nervous tissue.  The rapid bandpass switching                  
              time of the acousto-optic devices will permit dynamic studies to               
              be performed on a time scale commensurate with the electrical                  
              signaling of neurons.
