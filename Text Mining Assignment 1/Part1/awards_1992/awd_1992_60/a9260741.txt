Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The imaging performance of ground-based astronomical telescopes is             
              compromised by atmospheric turbulence.  There has been increased               
              interest in the use of adaptive optics to correct for atmospheric              
              distortion.  One general concept for atmospheric compensation                  
              involves the use of a so-called artificial guide star, created by              
              illumination of the mesospheric sodium layer, to generate the                  
              information needed for control of the adaptive optics.  It is the              
              intent of this proposed SBIR effort to design (in Phase I) and test            
              (in Phase II) key elements of a prototype solid state laser for use            
              with a sodium-guide-star system.  The laser would employ sum-                  
              frequency generation of pulsed, 589-nm radiation from two Nd:YAG               
              lasers operating at 1065 and 1319 nm.  In follow-on efforts, a                 
              commercial laser would be developed for limited production, and                
              sold to observatories worldwide as part of a complete atmospheric-             
              compensation system.
