Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Individuals in many occupations and environmental situations can be            
              subjected to conditions that may have adverse effects on subjective            
              well-being, productivity, and performance.  These conditions                   
              include the more traditional "treatment" conditions, such as job               
              stress, thermal stress, drugs, and sleep loss, as well as                      
              conditions obtaining in more modern systems such as simulators and             
              virtual reality systems.  The purpose of this effort is to provide             
              an objective indicator of stable baseline behaviors related to the             
              overall status and functional integrity of the human central                   
              nervous system.  Such an index would have obvious relevance for the            
              safe and successful execution of regularly controlled activities in            
              the work-place and, at the same time, would be capable of achieving            
              laboratory accuracy.  The activity to be monitored is the                      
              integrated behavior of the visual system to image an object of                 
              interest on the fovea, a coordinated behavior in humans that can be            
              disrupted by many things.  The premise of this research is that                
              monitoring this activity (measuring the deviation of the eye/head              
              from the desired position) can be a global and sensitive index of              
              the functional status of a person's ability to perform error-free              
              work.  To this end, this project will validate experimentally and              
              then produce a highly portable device for the measurement of an                
              individual's control of stance.
