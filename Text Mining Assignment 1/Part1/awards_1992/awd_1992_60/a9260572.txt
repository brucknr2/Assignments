Abstract    :
              The objective of this SBIR proposal (phase I and II) is to                     
              explore new technology that can be used to ultimately develop                  
              during phase III a low cost modular NMR console that can replace               
              any commercially available console and provide up to date                      
              performance at a cost of less than $100,000.                                   
                                                                                             
              During Phase I, new RF technology currently used in cellular                   
              phone and other consumer product technology will be evaluated in               
              an NMR spectrometer.  In particular new Frequency Generation and               
              new IF Detection schemes for NMR Observe Unit will be studied in               
              an NMR spectrometer and their respective performance will be                   
              assessed.                                                                      
                                                                                             
              During Phase II, several units derived from the technology                     
              explored in phase I will be designed, built and tested in an NMR               
              environment.  This will include a complete broadband observe                   
              unit, a multi-nuclei decoupler and a field-frequency lock                      
              channel.  The end result will be a complete low-cost modular NMR               
              console.  This should be an attractive alternative to expensive                
              NMR spectrometers and should help improve the funding problems                 
              for state of the art equipment.  Commercial development and                    
              application will follow during Phase III.
