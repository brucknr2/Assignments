Abstract    :
              An SBIR Phase I Award will support development of instrumentation              
              to study corrosion based on detection of the magnetic fields                   
              which are generated by the corrosion currents.  The sensitivity                
              and spatial resolution will be evaluated and refined and the                   
              possibility of remote, non-invasive determination of details of                
              the corrosion processes will be evaluated.
