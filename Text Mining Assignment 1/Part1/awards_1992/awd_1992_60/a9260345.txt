Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Superhard refractory materials have important applications in                  
              metal shaping equipment and heat engines due to their high-                    
              temperature properties.  However, these desirable engineering                  
              properties are major obstacles to the fabrication of useful                    
              shapes.  In addition they suffer from low fracture toughness as                
              compared to metals.                                                            
                                                                                             
              Conventional processing methods at or near equilibrium conditions              
              are limited with respect to peak pressure and temperature                      
              capability.  They are also very limited in their capability to                 
              produce heat-treatable ceramic composites.                                     
                                                                                             
              We propose to apply a non-equilibrium method for consolidation of              
              silicon carbide composites containing an electrically conductive               
              phase.  In this process a fine powder mixture is subjected to                  
              mechanical pressure and an intense current pulse with a duration               
              that is typically less than a millisecond.  Under these                        
              conditions the conductive phase is melted and alloyed with the                 
              silicon carbide phase with a minimum of heat loss to the                       
              containment structure.  The rapid cooling of the compact is                    
              expected to result in a heat-treatable solid solution or                       
              extremely fine microstructure.                                                 
              %%%                                                                            
              The materials under development are applicable to cutting tools,               
              dies, armor, and wear components.
