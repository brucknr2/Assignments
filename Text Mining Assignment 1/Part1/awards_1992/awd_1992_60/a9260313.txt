Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Radial gradient index (GRIN) lenses have a refractive index                    
              profile which varies radially outward from the optical axis.                   
              High numerical aperture GRIN Lenses use glasses containing                     
              thallium oxide.  The refractive index gradient is produced by ion              
              exchange of potassium, K+, from a molten salt bath, for thallium,              
              Tl+ in the glass.  Thallium is highly toxic making its use                     
              prohibitive in a manufacturing environment in the United States.               
              Of the single valent ions only silver and thallium provide a                   
              large enough index change to produce high numerical aperture GRIN              
              lenses when exchanged with alkali ions.  We propose to use a                   
              silver containing glass and exchange of sodium for silver to                   
              produce the gradient.l.  His work will address the problem of                  
              optimizing the composition of a silver containing glass ion                    
              exchange.  The glass must have relatively high ionic mobility, be              
              chemically resistant to the salt bath, and produce a good                      
              refractive index profile to provide high quality imaging.  A                   
              series of silver containing glasses will be melted and their                   
              conductivity and chemical resistance measured.  Ion exchange                   
              experiments will be performed in the successful candidate glasses              
              and the refractive index profile will be measured and analyzed.
