Abstract    :
              This is an award to support research on the feasibility of using               
              an electron beam to remove hydrocarbon pollutants from exhaust                 
              gases emerging from combustion processes to reduce or eliminate                
              their potential for polluting air into which they are discharged.              
              The experiments will be conducted using an existing, pulsed                    
              induction accelerator to irradiate controlled gas mixtures                     
              containing aromatic and chlorinated aromatic organic compounds                 
              such as benzene and chlorobenzene.  The work plan includes                     
              analyses to identify the byproducts produced during radiation,                 
              their concentrations and the dose of radiation required to reduce              
              their concentration to environmentally acceptable levels..                     
                                                                                             
              Results of this project are expected to provide the basis for                  
              engineering design of an optimal, all-solid-state induction                    
              accelerator system for the reduction to acceptable levels of the               
              concentration of hydrocarbons in exhaust gases from combustion                 
              processes that are subjected to electron beam radiation.  The                  
              proposal leading to this award was submitted in response to NSF
