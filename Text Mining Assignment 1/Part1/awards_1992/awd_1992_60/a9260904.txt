Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is              
              in the general area of analytical and surface chemistry and in the             
              subfield of biosensors.  The objective of this research is to                  
              evaluate the feasibility of an improved biosensor electrode which              
              uses a two enzyme relay that is coupled to a sensing electrode via             
              a modified polymer-mediator complex.  The overall goal of a                    
              multiphase SBIR effort is to develop improved amperometric                     
              biosensors based on electrical communication between horseradish               
              peroxidase (HRP) and several new polymeric electrode relay                     
              systems.  The design strategy is to use an electrode modified with             
              HRP to detect the hydrogen peroxide formed by the selective                    
              reaction of a substrate with an oxidoreductase enzyme.  Electrical             
              communication between the HRP and cathode is effected by several               
              new polymer systems which improve stability and optimize the                   
              response.  Because the final reaction is cathodic, this type of                
              sensor has the advantage of being able to operate at applied                   
              potentials where the detection of common electroactive                         
              interferents does not occur.                                                   
              %%%                                                                            
              The research plan for this SBIR Phase I project is designed to                 
              account for traditional problems encountered in the assay of                   
              blood-based analytes and should determine the feasibility of                   
              moving forward into a Phase II effort.  If successful, this                    
              technology has significant commercial potential.
