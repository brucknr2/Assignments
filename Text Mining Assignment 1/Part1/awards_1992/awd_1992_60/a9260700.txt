Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Silicon x-ray energy spectrometers have become very important tools            
              for elemental analysis in research and industry.  The deep                     
              sensitive depths required for Si x-ray detectors and some other Si             
              detectors and some other Si detector applications are usually                  
              obtained by a Li compensation technique commonly referred to as Li             
              Drifting.  Unfortunately, the Li compensation, Si(Li), is only                 
              quasi-stable at room temperature and very unstable at higher                   
              temperatures.  This temperature stability problem limits the                   
              performance and general usefulness of these detectors by                       
              prohibiting modern device processing technologies like oxide                   
              surface passivation and high temperature contact formation.  The               
              lack of oxide surface passivation to limit noise from surface                  
              leakage currents places severe restrictions on the maximum                     
              operating temperature of Li compensated detectors.  The lack of a              
              rugged oxide passivation and rugged diffused or implanted contacts             
              seriously restricts the operating ambient of Si(Li) devices.  We               
              outline here an alternative approach to compensation of Si which               
              should allow sensitive depths >3 mm, be compatible with high                   
              temperature oxide passivations, allow high temperature contact                 
              formation, and be much cheaper than Li drifting.  This new                     
              technology should result in cheaper x-ray detectors which will                 
              operate well at temperatures obtainable with thermoelectric or                 
              other simple cooling techniques rather than liquid nitrogen.  It               
              should also make it possible to build very large area, deep                    
              sensitive depth detectors at reasonable prices.
