Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Use of the Escherichia coli Beta-glucuronidase gene (GUS) as a                 
              fusion marker for analysis of gene expression in transform plants              
              has been demonstrated (Jefferson, et al. 1987). The synthesis, by              
              chemical and enzymatic methods, of a series of glucuronic acid                 
              conjugates of plant regulatory substances is proposed. In Phase I,             
              we will be we will synthesize conjugates of herbicides and toxins              
              and test these conjugates for the ability to specifically ablate               
              tissues and cells expressing GUS activity. Conjugates will be                  
              assayed in tissue culture and in whole plants for the ability top              
              cause localized cell death in a promoter dependent manner. Such                
              compounds will be of general use for plant research into the                   
              control of development and gene expression and have the potential              
              to produce agriculturally important sterile  plant species in a                
              reversible manner, through the use of selective application of                 
              substrate and choice of GUS-fusion promoter.
