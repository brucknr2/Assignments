Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Silicon carbide whiskers which are single crystal SiC are known to             
              exhibit near theoretical mechanical properties including virtually             
              no creep and strength retention at high temperatures.  The                     
              techniques of growing single crystal SiC whiskers will be adapted              
              to the growth of continuous single crystal SiC fibers.  Development            
              of continuous filament SiC that has exceptional strength and creep             
              resistance to very high temperatures will contribute to the                    
              development of advanced ceramic, intermetallic and metal matrix                
              composite materials in a variety of engine, energy conversion and              
              structural applications.
