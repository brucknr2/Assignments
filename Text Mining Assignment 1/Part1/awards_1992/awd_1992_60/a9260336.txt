Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This research is aimed at developing a perovskite membrane                     
              system for the conversion of hydrogen sulfide (H2S) into water                 
              and elemental sulfur.  The starting point of the process is                    
              the introduction of H2S on one side of the membrane.  The                      
              system is heated to cause the thermal decomposition of the                     
              hydrogen sulfide gas into hydrogen gas (H2) and sulfur.  This                  
              reaction is further promoted by depositing a catalyst on the                   
              face of the membrane to promote the decomposition.  The H2                     
              formed will be oxidized to H+ and an electron, and these                       
              charged species will be conducted across the membrane.  The                    
              opposite end of the membrane will be exposed to air and will                   
              be coated with a La0.9Sr0.1 CoO3 catalyst.  This catalyst will                 
              mediate the reaction of the migrating H+ and electron species                  
              arriving at the opposite face with oxygen available from the                   
              air to form water.  The process promises to be a low cost                      
              method for removing hydrogen sulfide from the product gases of                 
              coal gasification and heavy oil desulfurization, and thereby                   
              allowing these reject gases to conform to environmental                        
              emission regulations.
