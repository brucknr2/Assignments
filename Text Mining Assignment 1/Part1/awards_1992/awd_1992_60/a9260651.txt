Abstract    :
              Because of its dilation property, the wavelet transform is the                 
              preferred approach for processing broadband signals in both civil              
              and military environments.  Unfortunately, its computation requires            
              a large number of numerical operations.  In many situations, this              
              may be prohibitively expensive is not unrealistic.  Analog parallel            
              processing techniques including optical methods are either                     
              unsuitable or not accurate enough for practical applications, and              
              hence, for possible commercialization.  Switched-capacitor                     
              techniques, which substitute appropriate combinations of high-                 
              speed switches and capacitors for resistors, are not used in VLSI              
              implementations of active filter designs.  The most important                  
              property of a switched-capacitor circuit is that its clock                     
              frequency controls the filter parameters.                                      
                                                                                             
              The purpose of this proposal is to implement the wavelet transform             
              using switched-capacitor circuits.  What makes this possibility is             
              the observation that the dilation effect in a wavelet filter can               
              be realized by the adjusting of the clock frequency.  By using                 
              current VLSI techniques based on the proposed scheme, large numbers            
              of wavelet filter channels can be fabricated on a single chip.                 
              These IC chips can be used as standard components in a signal                  
              processing unit having increased resolution.  They will also offer             
              reliable real-time processing and full compatibility with other                
              state-of-the-art electronic equipment.  Near future                            
              commercialization of these devices is anticipated.
