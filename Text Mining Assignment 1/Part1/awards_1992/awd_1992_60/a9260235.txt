Abstract    :
              Advances in sensors, analog to digital converters, and                         
              instrumentation in general are fostering a need for similar                    
              advances in the output noise performance of the power supplies that            
              provide power to these devices.  To ensure that the power supply               
              noise does not degrade or limit the performance of present state               
              of the art sensors and signal processing circuits, reduction of                
              noise by 40 to 60 dB is needed.  This is beyond a reasonable                   
              expectation for conventional methods, so research into new methods             
              of power conversion specifically aimed at reducing noise is                    
              proposed.                                                                      
                                                                                             
              The purpose of this research is to develop methods that will reduce            
              as much as possible the sources of the noise.  The methods will                
              greatly reduce or eliminate the generation of high order harmonics             
              so that subsequent filtering and shielding will be more effective.
