Abstract    :
              A "hypercomputer" is the parallel computer that emerges when                   
              one sums the unused cycles over all the computer nodes on a                    
              Local Area Network.  However, fault-tolerance is a critical                    
              issue for longer-lived applications running on typical LANS                    
              where node failures are not uncommon.  Process checkpoint and                  
              restart mechanisms will be developed to allow parallel network                 
              computations to proceed even as their constituent parts fail.                  
                                                                                             
              The resulting system will be a fault-tolerant, extensible,                     
              cost effective supercomputer based on low cost, high                           
              performance scientific workstations connected via a local area                 
              network.
