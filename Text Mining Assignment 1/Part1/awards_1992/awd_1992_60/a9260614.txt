Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Microwave sintering of ceramic materials provides an exciting                  
              alternative to conventional sintering processes.  Typically,                   
              microwave sintering offers efficient and rapid thermal heating of              
              ceramic materials that absorb microwave radiations.  However,                  
              microwave sintering has its challenges, which include a poor                   
              understanding of microwave - materials interactions, unstable                  
              heating resulting in a thermal runaway, and localized melting.  A              
              new method has been proposed under this program which addresses                
              many of these challenges.  This method is especially well suited               
              for complex ceramic oxide systems that are difficult to process by             
              microwave radiation.  A suitable transient - lossy - phase will be             
              selected that will absorb microwave radiation promoting a reaction             
              with other phases to form a complex oxide system that has low                  
              dielectric loss, thus limiting further microwave adsorption.  Such             
              self limiting or "smart" microwave processing can be used to solve             
              many problems associated with microwave sintering.                             
                                                                                             
              "Smart" microwave processing will yield materials with highly                  
              reproducible properties.  This process will allow rapid processing             
              of ceramic materials.  This research work will also provide a                  
              significant dielectric properties database which will be useful for            
              academic research as well as industrial applications.
