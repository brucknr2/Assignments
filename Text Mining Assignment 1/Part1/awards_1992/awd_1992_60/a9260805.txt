Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Use of UV dyes is advantageous in many fluorescence detection                  
              applications due to the favorable dye properties (OPA, for                     
              example, tags the primary amines with a fast reaction at room                  
              temperature).  However, UV dyes can only be excited with weak                  
              plasma sources or bulky and unreliable lasers.   What is needed                
              for this market is a rugged fluorescence detector with the                     
              sensitivity of the laser by the size of the plasma source.  We                 
              propose to develop such a detector based on diode laser                        
              technology.  Our calculations show it will be orders of magnitude              
              more sensitive than conventional plasma-based detectors, yet                   
              significantly smaller and cheaper than the existing lasers.  Our               
              solid-state approach has no moving parts, and promises a mean                  
              time before failure of tens of thousands of hours.  In the Phase               
              I program, we will construct a laboratory model of the light                   
              source and measure the generated UV power.  In Phase II, we will               
              construct the detector, install it in a commercial separation or               
              analysis system, and compare its performance with the best                     
              alternatives.
