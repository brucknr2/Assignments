Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The concept of momentum transfer is used for removal of submicron              
              particulates by supplying droplets of solvent at high velocity.                
              In particular, liquid carbon dioxide is substituted for formerly               
              used solvents (CFCs) to achieve enhanced ultracleaning lower                   
              costs than in other substitute technologies, while removing CFCs               
              from use, as required by the terms of the Montreal Protocol.                   
              Experimental work varying conditions of operation, using specular              
              surfaces as test objects and optical methods of documenting                    
              results will be used to optimize the procedure and compare                     
              results with alternative technologies.  Existing, commercial                   
              embodiments of the core technology will be retrofitted for early               
              use of findings in industry.
