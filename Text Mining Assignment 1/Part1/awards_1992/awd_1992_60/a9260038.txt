Abstract    :
              This project is concerned with the synthesis and characterization              
              of ferrocene based surfactants.  Ferrocene is a chemical group                 
              which consists of an iron atom in the +2 oxidation state sharing               
              electrons with two five membered rings so that the rings become                
              aromatic.  The ferrocene can be oxidized to a unit positive charge             
              by the loss of an electron from the iron so that the Fe is in the              
              +3 oxidation state; addition of the electron regenerates the                   
              ferrocene as Fe is reduced back to the +2 state.  The uncharged and            
              +1 charged ferrocene therefore form a reversible (switchable) redox            
              pair.  The study will attempt to attach hydrocarbon moieties to one            
              ring of the ferrocene group.  The attachment of the hydrocarbon                
              group gives the resulting molecule a switchable surfactant                     
              character; in the oxidized, uncharged form it is essentially a                 
              nonpolar molecule while in the oxidized form it is a cationic                  
              surfactant with a charged headgroup and a hydrocarbon tail.  This              
              project will explore various synthesis routes for making different             
              kinds of switchable surfactants, and will characterize the ability             
              of the surface active form to lower interfacial tension, and to                
              form micelles.  The micelle forming ability of the surfactant is               
              a key feature.  When the surfactant is in the surface active form              
              and has formed micelles, reduction will deactivate the amphiphillic            
              character thereby causing the micelles to breakup.  This ability               
              to break micelles on demand is important in many surfactant based              
              separations where micelles solubilize targeted products.  In each              
              of these separations, a final step is to remove the solute from the            
              micelle; by using switchable surfactants, reduction can affect                 
              breakup of the micelle and release of the solute.
