Abstract    :
              Because of their speed and cost effectiveness, machines are                    
              continuing to replace "unskilled" human labor.  If the United                  
              States is to maintain its competitiveness in the world markets, its            
              machines must become still more sophisticated, replacing human                 
              labor in more complex or dangerous tasks.  This transition would               
              be greatly accelerated if machines could "see" like humans.                    
                                                                                             
              The front end preprocessor for human vision is the retina.  By                 
              parallel edge processing, it transfers to the brain, in real-time,             
              the essential characteristics of the scene being viewed.  The brain            
              then interprets the image outline and initiates behaviors.  This               
              is a project for a very high-performance retina-like                           
              microelectronic processor called the Super Retina Analog Parallel              
              Processor (SRAP).  The SRAP is a high-speed analog parallel                    
              processor that outputs retina-like compressed-image information.               
              It is faster than the human retina and in addition, could be used              
              in the infrared as well as the visible spectrum.  It is equivalent             
              to hundreds of conventional digital processors working in parallel             
              and is orders of magnitude smaller in size, weight, and cost.                  
                                                                                             
              The research objectives are:  1)  Define the imaging requirements              
              for SRAP-relevant machine and robotic vision scenarios, isolating              
              and emphasizing near-term commercial applications.  2)  Translate              
              these requirements into modifications of the baseline SRAP chip                
              designs with as much general applicability as possible.  3)  Verify            
              the function and fabrication of the chip designs by SPICE                      
              simulations.
