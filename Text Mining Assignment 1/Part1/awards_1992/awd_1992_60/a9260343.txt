Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The objective of the proposed research program is the development              
              and demonstration of adaptable vibration analysis sensors which                
              use specialized weighted-sensitivity optical fiber waveguide                   
              structures.  Several methods to create the necessary sensitivity               
              variations along the length of the waveguide are suggested, based              
              in part upon prior published research of the principal                         
              investigators and Fiber & Sensor Technologies, Inc.  Extensions                
              of this work to further permit the realtime modification of such               
              spatial fiber sensitivity profiles, and hence the in-line optical              
              signal processing of integrated sensor signals, will also be                   
              investigated.  Applications of sensor instrumentation products                 
              which would use such adaptive, weighted fiber elements include                 
              vibration analysis systems for noise suppression, active                       
              structural acoustic control, and structural damage monitoring.                 
              Additional uses in adaptive electromagnetic detection arrays for               
              both the communication and biomedical diagnostics areas seem                   
              possible.  Fiber & Sensor Technologies will with cooperation from              
              the Fiber & ElectroOptics Research Center at Virginia Tech to                  
              model, fabricate and test the performance of weighted sensitivity              
              fibers for selective vibrational mode analysis of laboratory                   
              demonstration articles during the proposed Phase I project.
