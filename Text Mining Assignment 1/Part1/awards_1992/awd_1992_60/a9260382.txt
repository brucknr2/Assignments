Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is              
              in the general area of analytical and surface chemistry and in the             
              subfield of magnetic resonance spectroscopy.  The objective of                 
              this research is to determine the feasibility of constructing a                
              novel, high speed magic angle spinning system for use in nuclear               
              magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy.  The approach chosen will               
              use both technology which is based upon gas bearing systems and                
              technologies previously developed by Creare personnel for                      
              incorporation into a variety of devices, some of which have been               
              commercialized.  Current sample spinners for NMR spectroscopy are              
              generally limited in rotation speed to approximately 10 kHz.  A                
              unique gas bearing system based on principles successfully                     
              employed in high speed, miniature cryogenic turbomachines will be              
              used to achieve a 40 kHz rotation speed.  The bearing will                     
              incorporate damping cavities and feed orifices to provide capacity             
              and stability.  The bearing will also be configured to accommodate             
              unbalance from nonuniform packing of sample material.  In Phase                
              I, a shaft will be spun to 40 kHz to demonstrate the feasibility               
              of the approach.  If successful, a complete ultra high speed                   
              sample spinner assembly could then be demonstrated in Phase II.                
              %%%                                                                            
              This research will test the feasibility of an NMR sample spinner               
              that is capable of stable operation at rotation speeds of up to 40             
              kHz.  This device would significantly improve the resolution                   
              capability of solid state NMR by reducing spectrum broadening                  
              effects caused by proton-proton dipolar couplings.
