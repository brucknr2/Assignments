Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project                 
              has as its purpose the development of interactive multimedia                   
              software for teaching science to K-12 students.  The software                  
              will enable students to search for evidence, sharpen their                     
              analytical skills, consult with national experts, and invoke                   
              strengths in writing and creative expression to stimulate their                
              interest in science.  In particular, the software will provide                 
              students with a toolkit for (1) searching video recordings of                  
              scientific and natural phenomena for usable data, (2) extracting,              
              organizing, and analyzing the data, and (3) preparing written,                 
              audio, and video presentations on the computer.  Students will                 
              also be able to add their own video events for analysis and be                 
              able to compare their results with the comments and findings of                
              scientific experts.  In the creation of the software, special                  
              attention will be paid to female and minority students.
