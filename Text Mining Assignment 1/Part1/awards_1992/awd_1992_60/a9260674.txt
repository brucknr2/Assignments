Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This SBIR Phase I research addresses the feasibility of a web                  
              optical scanner for manufacturing process control.  The concept                
              uses on-line diffuse reflectance and transmittance measurements.               
              A fiber optic coupler, which is an essential modular component of              
              such an on-line reflectance/transmittance, system will be                      
              designed and fabricated in Phase I.  This will be the basis for                
              coupling ultraviolet, visible, and near infrared illumination to               
              a sheet and from a high density, 200-per-meter, linear pixel                   
              array, to a single photodetector.                                              
                                                                                             
              The fiber optic coupler will be integrated with a shutter                      
              mechanism to provide serial readout in a line across the web.                  
              The cross web scan of commercial devices will be 100 milliseconds              
              for an entire sheet width.  A reflectance scanner assembly can be              
              compact, noncontacting, and adaptable to a range of illumination               
              and detection angles.  High resolution (1 millimeter) machine and              
              cross directional profiles will be possible on constituent                     
              concentrations and variations over a range of machine-direction                
              surface lengths from 10 meters to 1 millimeter.                                
                                                                                             
              Reflectance/transmittance spectroscopy permits measurement of                  
              average coatweight and high spatial resolution variance of                     
              coatweight, as well as similar determination such as color,                    
              moisture, binder concentration, gloss, and fluorescence factors.               
              This scanner technology is thought to hold advantages in                       
              coatweight measurements over the widely applied technology of                  
              traversing, beta-ray measurements, with its use of radioisotopes.
