Abstract    :
                   The goal of this project is to study the feasibility of                   
              developing a product modeling system that provides information for             
              process planning, including machining planning and assembly                    
              planning.  To accomplish this, ongoing research will be extended               
              on an assembly oriented product modeler.  The intentions of the                
              designer, with respect to manufacturing a given product, will be               
              propagated from the modeler to the process planning system.  The               
              modeler will allow manufacturing process information (i.e.                     
              tolerance and surface finish specifications, spatial relationships,            
              feasible approach directions, precedence constraints, part and                 
              feature symmetry, etc.) to be extracted, or generated, at the                  
              design stage.  This research will focus on the development of a                
              spatial; relationship based modeling system supporting the                     
              generation of dimensions and tolerances.                                       
                   This work will eventually produce a stand-alone design system             
              for mechanical components with the above capabilities, and                     
              possessing its own on-board graphics capabilities.
