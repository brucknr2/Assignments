Abstract    :
              A micromechanical constitutive damage (MCD) model, which                       
              incorporates an elastic-viscoplastic matrix, fiber-matrix                      
              debonding, residual stresses and fiber packing geometry, will be               
              developed for use with metal-matrix composites.  The MCD model                 
              will incorporate continuum models of fracture and fatigue at the               
              local fiber-matrix level.  Tools will be developed to incorporate              
              computed tomography data into the model.  The model will be used               
              in simulations that will help to increase understanding of how                 
              cracks at this level propagate and what material parameters are                
              helpful in controlling fatigue crack growth.
