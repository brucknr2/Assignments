Abstract    :
              This is an award to support research on the feasibility of using               
              air-sparged, hydrocyclone flotation technology in the recovery of              
              oil that has contaminated water.  This technology was developed                
              originally for efficient removal of fine particles suspended in                
              water by flotation.  This technology combines froth flotation                  
              principles with those obtained by use of a hydrocyclone.                       
                                                                                             
              This technology has shown promise in being applied to the                      
              concentration of metal ores and other minerals of industrial                   
              significance, cleaning of coal and in the treatment of wastewater              
              from deinking processes.  This project addresses its potential                 
              for removal of oil from water that has been contaminated with oil              
              as from accidental spills or as derived from remediation of oil-               
              contaminated soil.  The proposal leading to this award was                     
              submitted in response to NSF 92-30, Small Business Innovation                  
              Research under Topic No. 25d, Environmental Systems.
