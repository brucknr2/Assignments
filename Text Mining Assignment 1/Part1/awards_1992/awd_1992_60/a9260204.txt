Abstract    :
              Math libraries are an important part of programming                            
              environments that support the development of application                       
              software.  While broadly available on sequential computers,                    
              math libraries are rare for parallel computers - especially in                 
              the case of distributed computing across networks of                           
              workstations.                                                                  
                                                                                             
              This project is to conduct research leading to a portable                      
              version of the LAPACK library for network distributed                          
              computers.  LAPACK was selected since it is probably the most                  
              important math library in use today.  The key research issues                  
              to resolve in this project are to find data decompositions and                 
              algorithms that support efficient execution with the coarse                    
              granularities found on networks of workstations.                               
                                                                                             
              These results will be analyzed as part of the feasibility                      
              study.  They will form the basis of the work plan for                          
              implementing the library for the Phase II proposal that would                  
              follow.
