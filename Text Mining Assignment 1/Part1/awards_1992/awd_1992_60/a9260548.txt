Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                                                                                             
                                                                                            
              Remote, reliable accelerometers suitable for deployment on the                 
              ocean floor are needed for geophysical studies.  In response to                
              this need Optical Technologies, Inc. (OPTECH) is designing an all-             
              optical, remote fiber-optic accelerometer system that requires no              
              electrical conductors or connections in the water.  The                        
              accelerometer system will provide significant benefits and                     
              features; including broad-band response, low maintenance, no                   
              electrical conductors/connections in the water, wide dynamic range,            
              no electrical power required at the sensor, and remote sensing                 
              capability.
