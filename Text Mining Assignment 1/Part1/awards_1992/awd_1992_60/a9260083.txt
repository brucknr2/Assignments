Abstract    :
              An SBIR Phase I Award will support optimization of a newly                     
              developed iron-based high-boron coating for high temperature                   
              tribological applications, particularly in the area of metal                   
              forming.  Tribological performance will be correlated with                     
              microstructure in order to determine the optimal deposition                    
              conditions for various applications.
