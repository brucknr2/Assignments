Abstract    :
              The objective of this program is to initiate the development of a              
              new and very powerful family of error correcting codes (i.e.                   
              algebraic geometry codes from Hermitian curves), by laying the                 
              groundwork for the implementation of one of the shorter codes from             
              this family.  Development of a near-term product for early                     
              commercialization is expected to benefit the longer term goal of               
              more broadly exploiting this family of codes.  The decoder                     
              structure is being defined in sufficient detail to allow pre-design            
              of the decoder hardware in preparation for a Phase II hardware                 
              feasibility demonstration program.  A computer simulation of the               
              decoding algorithm is also being developed.
