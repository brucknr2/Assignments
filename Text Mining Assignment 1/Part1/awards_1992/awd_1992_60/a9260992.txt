Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Foraging behavior and its interactions with the environment are                
              complex and multidimensional. Simulation holds the promise of                  
              helping laboratory biologists and field ecologists work with data              
              and theoretical models and gain insights into behavioral                       
              mechanisms. The increasing power of desktop computers has brought              
              computer simulation technology to  anew level of accessibility. The            
              use of simulation in foraging behavior research is in its infancy;             
              there is great potential for its use in representation and                     
              interpretation of actual and simulated experiments. It is clear                
              that with appropriate behavior simulation models, biologists and               
              ecologists could make significant advances in understanding                    
              foraging processes. The goal of Phase I is to evaluate simulation              
              techniques for a prototype foraging behavior simulation model. The             
              approach will be to develop a shell program that will allow users              
              to specify foraging tactics, habitat structure, etc., and to set up            
              simulated factorial experiments. We will evaluate simulation                   
              techniques and algorithms for their specific application to                    
              behavioral processes. This project will require original research              
              on the question of how to simulate phenomena such as decisions and             
              spatial behavior.
