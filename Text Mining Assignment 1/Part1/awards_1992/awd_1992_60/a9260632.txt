Abstract    :
              Due to the need for faster processing, a growing  number of newer              
              computing models are increasing speed with intriguing physical                 
              designs.  Massive parallelism, for example, exploits unique                    
              physical arrangements in order to increase computer performance.               
              Seemingly, the signal itself is becoming less important.  One can              
              extrapolate further and envision a computer concept, where the only            
              role of the signals is to establish a stable structure, which in               
              turn would imply solution.                                                     
                                                                                             
              The objective of this research is to examine a working hypothesis              
              that certain high performance computing can be done by negotiating             
              equilibria of appropriate anti-symmetric digital circuits through              
              random noise.  The experimental circuits to be used will be                    
              embodiments of particular algorithms.  If the partial inputs and               
              outputs keep well defined values, then we believe that it is                   
              possible to superimpose chaotic perturbations in such a way that               
              the processor will settle to its stable state if and only if it                
              attains a solution of the algorithm.  Such an asynchronous                     
              resonance processor can be a high performance platform for a                   
              variety of applications, primarily in the area of computer                     
              intelligence.
