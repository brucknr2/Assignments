Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Picosecond optical pulses have many scientific and                             
              instrumentation applications, such as lifetime measurements in                 
              chemistry, biology, and physics, optical probing of integrated                 
              circuits, testing of photodiodes and optoelectronic components,                
              optical time domain reflectometry, etc.  Currently, Q-switched                 
              lasers are limited by their energy storage (upper-state lifetime)              
              to sub-Megahertz repetition rates and pulse widths on the order                
              of a nanosecond.  Mode-locked lasers generate picosecond and                   
              femtosecond pulses, but are normally limited to pulse rates above              
              approximately 75 MHz because their cavity length becomes                       
              prohibitively long (greater than 2 meters) for lower pulse                     
              repetition rates.  We propose to develop integrated fiber lasers               
              with repetition rates in the range of 1- to 100-MHz for                        
              instrumentation and measurement applications, which benefit from               
              these intermediate-range pulse rates.  Such a laser would be very              
              compact and require no user adjustments to optimize performance.               
              Diodepumping of the laser provides high efficiency and long                    
              operating lifetime.  By changing the length of the fiber cavity                
              and the repetition rate to the modulator, the repetition rate                  
              could be easily changed.  Adding a fiber amplifier at the output               
              easily allows for higher average power where required.  Solition               
              pulse-shaping effects could be used to generate enhanced                       
              monomers.  In Phase II, X(2) FLC polymers will be synthesized,                 
              characterized, and incorporated into a frequency doubling device               
              containing a near-infrared diode laser or other device identified              
              during Phase I.
