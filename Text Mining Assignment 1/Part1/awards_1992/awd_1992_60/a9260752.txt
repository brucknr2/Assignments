Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Conventional chemical vapor deposition (CVD) processing of BaTiO3              
              thin films requires temperatures that are incompatible with                    
              standard silicon processing technology.  Photo-enhanced CVD has not            
              been attempted for BaTiO3 and has significant potential for solving            
              both the non-uniformity and temperature problems.  The feasibility             
              of the photo-CVD deposition of BaTiO3 will be determined.  Key to              
              this study will be a novel approach to the generation of atomic                
              oxygen and its study by on-line mass spectrometry which will lead              
              to enhanced understanding of the role of atomic oxygen in the                  
              formation of perovskite ferroelectrics.  These techniques have                 
              potential for commercialization of both precursors and equipment               
              for dielectric thin film fabrication for use in the electronics                
              industry.
