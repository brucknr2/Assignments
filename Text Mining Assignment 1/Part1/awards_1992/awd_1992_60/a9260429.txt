Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The goal of this effort is to develop a parallel 3D fast boundary              
              element method with enhanced computational speed, low storage                  
              requirement and reduced inter-processor communication overhead.                
              A preliminary 2D calculation carried out at Continuum Dynamics,                
              Inc. has demonstrated the feasibility of the proposed new method.              
              It is based on an application of a fast methodology which we                   
              recently developed for a fast vortex computation.  A new inter-                
              processor communication algorithm with low overhead, which we                  
              developed for the parallel fast vortex method, will be used.  Two              
              applications of the new method will be carried out:  (i)  flow                 
              around solid body for aeronautical application and pharmaceutical              
              application.  The proposed enhancement to the boundary element will            
              allow realistic representation of the complex surface geometry                 
              encountered in a complete aircraft configuration or a protein                  
              macromolecule using as many as tens of thousands of computational              
              boundary elements.
