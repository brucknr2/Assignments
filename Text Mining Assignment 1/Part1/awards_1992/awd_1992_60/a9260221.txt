Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Geographic Information Systems (GIS) are powerful computer-based               
              tools for storing, managing, and manipulating information about                
              spatially-distributed phenomena.  GIS has proved extremely                     
              valuable to municipalities, government and non-profit agencies                 
              and private business, assisting them in information management,                
              planning and decision making, emergency response, and monitoring               
              of environmental change.                                                       
                                                                                             
              Effective use of GIS requires substantial training and expertise.              
              This has been a major obstacle to full realization of GIS'                     
              benefits in government and industry.  This project will develop a              
              software-based GIS Expert Assistant as an aid to enhance the                   
              training process, assist the occasional user, and improve                      
              reliability and consistency of GIS analysis results.  The GIS                  
              Expert Assistant will be built using the knowledge engineering                 
              techniques developed by the artificial intelligence community,                 
              and will incorporate knowledge and techniques recognized by                    
              experts in the GIS field.                                                      
                                                                                             
              The GIS Expert Assistant will function as a readily-available                  
              consultant or aide, providing immediate assistance while a user                
              is interacting with the GIS.  It is not intended to replace or                 
              overrule the experienced practitioner or instructor, but will                  
              enable more efficient use of these scarce human resources.                     
                                                                                             
              This research will provide the basis for implementing a                        
              commercial software package to assist users of GIS packages in                 
              learning and using their GIS more effectively.
