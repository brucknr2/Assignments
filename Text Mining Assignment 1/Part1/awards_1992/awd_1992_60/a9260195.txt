Abstract    :
              This Phase I SBIR project studies the use of                                   
              damping elements for earthquake resistance of                                  
              flexible frame buildings.  A new type of passive                               
              damping mechanism is studied that is potentially                               
              superior to conventional damping mechanisms:  a                                
              resonant viscous damper, or RVD.  The RVD will                                 
              be placed in the same locations as conventional                                
              earthquake dampers, but because it will possess an                             
              internal resonance tuned to a building's                                       
              fundamental resonant frequency.  As a result, it will                          
              offer much higher levels of passive damping.                                   
                                                                                             
              The objective of this project is to develop a                                  
              practical, reliable, and economical damping device                             
              that can be applied to a broad range of medium-                                
              sized buildings.  The Phase I goal is to validate the                          
              RVD concept by both analysis and testing of an                                 
              engineering model.  Current earthquake dampers                                 
              are designed to provide 20-30% structural damping.                             
              If successful, the RVD will provide over twice this                            
              damping in the primary mode of a building without                              
              any large increases in frame stiffness nor any large                           
              added masses.  The RVD will also reduce motion                                 
              due to wind sway.  An RVD will offer designers in                              
              any field of structural dynamics (civil, aerospace,                            
              mechanical) an attractive alternative solution to                              
              many vibration suppression problems.
