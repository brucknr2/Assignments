Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              A major limitation to the realization of the wide range of                     
              applications of microdevice technologies is the lack of a                      
              suitable thin film material.  Absence of internal stress, high                 
              hardness and low coefficient of friction are some of the many                  
              characteristics required for an ideal thin film material.  All                 
              the materials experimented with, to date, show major limitations.              
              The unique combination of properties of diamond like                           
              nanocomposite materials make them excellent candidates for the                 
              synthesis of microdevices.  The use of these coating is expected               
              to provide a major step in the advancement of microdevice                      
              technology.  The fabrication of microsensors based on these                    
              coatings will also render them biocompatible.  Further, the                    
              potential resolution of the microflow sensor suggested in this                 
              proposal is several orders of magnitude better that achieved with              
              presently available sensors.
