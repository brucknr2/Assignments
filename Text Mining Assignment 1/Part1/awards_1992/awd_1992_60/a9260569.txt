Abstract    :
                   The research project involves the development of an approach              
              for reducing or eliminating the problems associated with processing            
              of secondary ferrous metal and their representative costs.  Based              
              on a review of the actual industrial practice and operation data,              
              improved methods of grading, marking, and separating will be                   
              synthesized.  The developed methods will be incorporated into an               
              expert system that provides the manufacturer with a systematic                 
              process strategy to assist in cost-effective matching of product               
              grade with demand.                                                             
                   The research base should provide an expert system for use by              
              secondary ferrous metal manufacturers in outgoing quality control              
              and cost reduction.  The outcome can be adapted to non-ferrous                 
              metal recycling companies.
