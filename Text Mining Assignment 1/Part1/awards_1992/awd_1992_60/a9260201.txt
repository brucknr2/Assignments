Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project                 
              aims to produce a single purpose self-contained, hand-held                     
              calculator for chemistry, based on an earlier version which uses               
              a special keyboard connected to a personal computer.  This                     
              calculator, which can be viewed as a chemical data base with                   
              calculation powers, would provide students with a high powered                 
              special tool with which to access information about the elements               
              and basic rules of chemistry along with special functions unique               
              to chemistry.  Although initially useful expressly for chemistry               
              problem solving, this device when combined with new hand-held                  
              computers in the future could become widely available and used by              
              a more extensive audience.
