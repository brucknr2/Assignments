Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The electric and electronic properties of insulators are difficult             
              to measure by conventional methods which apply metal contacts to               
              the insulator surfaces.  A new technique has shown great potential.            
              It enables determination of contact-free, previously unmeasurable              
              fundamental properties of materials, especially of materials with              
              very low charge carrier concentrations and of semiconductors.  The             
              technique consists of measuring the dielectric polarization in an              
              electric field gradient.  By deconvoluting the various components              
              of the dielectric polarization, bulk and surface contributions can             
              be separated.  Thus, unique information is obtained about surface              
              charges, their sign and density as well as their associated                    
              internal field.  The method is also highly sensitive to changes in             
              the bulk polarization such as may be caused by the dissociation of             
              defects and generation of mobile charges.  By applying a static                
              electric field gradient and measuring the response as a function of            
              time, processes with long relaxation times, of the order of seconds            
              to hours, can be evaluated.  Such processes may be due to charge               
              carriers with very low drift mobilities which, however, may play an            
              important part in determining the long-term stability of electronic            
              devices or ferroelectrics.  The objective of the research is to                
              develop a Charge Distribution Probe which allows one to perform                
              measurements with high spatial resolution and determine the                    
              electronic properties of thin insulator layers.
