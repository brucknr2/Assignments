Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The goal of this research is to develop a method for producing                 
              composite coatings with strong compositional gradients.  Such                  
              coatings have proven extremely useful because their physical                   
              properties change continuously with depth.  Composite coatings thus            
              provide a smooth transition between disparate materials such as                
              metal and ceramics.  The method to be explored combines                        
              electrolytic codeposition with pulse reverse current (PRC)                     
              electroplating.  By careful control of the waveform, it is proposed            
              to demonstrate that electrolytic PRC codeposition can both enhance             
              and depress the ratio of particle to metal deposited over that                 
              found from codeposition  by means of direct current plating.  This             
              innovation has the potential to produce novel and improved coatings            
              in the electroplating industry.
