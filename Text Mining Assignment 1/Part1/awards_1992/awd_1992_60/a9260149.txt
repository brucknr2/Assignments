Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Immobilized Metal Affinity Chromatography (IMAC) has substantial               
              utility as a protein purification tool for both analytical and                 
              preparative applications.  There is a strong market need for an                
              IMAC support suitable for high performance liquid chromatography               
              (HPLC).  Chromatochem has developed an HPLC support with good pH               
              stability, low nonspecific binding, good capacity, durability and              
              rapid absorption kinetics.  Capture ligands are immobilized on                 
              large particle silica via a 50A hydrophilic tether.  This                      
              research will combine the ChromatoChem HPLC affinity support with              
              well-characterized affinity support with well-characterized                    
              affinity probes for IMAC of proteins.  Phase I goals are to                    
              prepare and characterize two new IMAC supports for HPLC, measure               
              the protein on the columns.  These studies will define the                     
              utility of immobilizing IMAC affinity probes on hydrophilic                    
              tethers for rapid, high resolution protein purification.
