Abstract    :
              This investigation will seek to                                                
              determine if an electronic                                                     
              connection can be made between                                                 
              intracellular redox components of                                              
              intact cells and an outside

              experiments on a photosynthetic

              following reasons:  1) the                                                     
              photosynthetic redox apparatus is                                              
              activated by light and therefore                                               
              convenient systems exist for                                                   
              initiating electron flow; and 2)                                               
              intact cyanobacteria cells are                                                 
              quite rugged and their                                                         
              photosynthetic electron transport                                              
              activity can be maintained over                                                
              lengthy periods of time.  It is                                                
              anticipated that this research will                                            
              result in a broad-based technique                                              
              that can be applied to a range of                                              
              microbes and cell types for the                                                
              development of new bioelectronic
