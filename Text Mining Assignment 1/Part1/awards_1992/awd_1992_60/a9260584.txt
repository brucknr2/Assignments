Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              A new polarizing metal thin film (MTF) material is proposed for                
              use as a high efficiency polarizer in Active Matrix Liquid                     
              Crystal Displays (AMLCDs).  The MTF polarizers will replace the                
              pair of plastic polarizers currently used.  Back-light must pass               
              through a AMLCD package consisting of a pair of polarizers, two                
              glass cell walls, thin film transistor, liquid crystal, diffuser               
              and color filters.  The total transmission of back-light is 2% to              
              5%, and a high efficiency polarizer pair will improve the light                
              through-put and AMLCD brightness.  The MTF polarizing material is              
              a new and novel non-organic sheet polarizer which utilizes                     
              polarizing metal thin film technology recently developed by                    
              Polatomic, Inc., for NASA.  A contrast (k1/k2) in excess of 1,400              
              at 600 nm was demonstrated for a single layer film.  The Phase I               
              technical effort will include a review of current AMLCD                        
              polarizers to define the metal film structure which meets this                 
              specification.  In Phase I we will identify a design concept for               
              the high efficiency MTF polarizer and prepare a Phase II Process               
              Development Plan describing the fabrication methods for building               
              a high performance AMLCD polarizer which will be demonstrated in               
              Phase II.
