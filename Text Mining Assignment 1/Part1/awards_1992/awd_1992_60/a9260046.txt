Abstract    :
              Ray tracing is a technique used in computer graphics wherein                   
              a ray much like a pencil beam of light is followed from its                    
              source and is allowed to reflect from the various surfaces of                  
              the room until it is gathered in the eye of the viewer.  This                  
              calculation technique (actually reversed in an actual program)                 
              allows for the accurate recreation of startling computer                       
              images.                                                                        
                                                                                             
              This research uses a similar technique to generate a computer                  
              code for the ray tracing of sound rays in a room.  The rays                    
              would be allowed to interact with the surfaces of the room and                 
              be reflected or absorbed according to the treatment on each                    
              surface.  The rays would then be gathered at a receiver                        
              location.  Both the amplitude and direction of the rays, as                    
              well as the time of arrival, would be retained for future                      
              processing.                                                                    
                                                                                             
              The reproduction of sound using an array of speakers located                   
              around the observer would be simulated.  A small number of                     
              speakers is anticipated, totalling approximately seven in                      
              number.  Experiments will be carried out to confirm that this                  
              number is sufficient to localize sound sources at arbitrary                    
              angles within the space.                                                       
                                                                                             
              The program will lead to the possibility of using digital                      
              signal processing to recreate the sound field of a space by                    
              playing a signal convolved with the room analysis through the                  
              speaker array.
