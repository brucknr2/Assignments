Abstract    :
              This proposal offers a possible solution to the problem electrical             
              power at remote locations in polar environments.  A Proton Exchange            
              Membrane Fuel Cell operating on stored hydrogen and ambient air can            
              operate unattended for six months or more.  The PI will design,                
              fabricate and test sub stack assemblies to provide information for             
              a more definitive program later.  Issues related to the use of air             
              as the oxidant will be explored including drying of the ion                    
              exchange membrane, freezing of internal components and product                 
              waster storage.
