Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The proposed correlator chip is intended for the two main                      
              application areas in radio astronomy:  cross-correlation                       
              spectroscopy in aperture synthesis arrays and autocorrelation                  
              spectroscopy at cm and mm wavelengths.                                         
                                                                                             
              The objectives of Phase I are to design, simulate, and layout a                
              CMOS digital correlator chip with the following characteristics:               
              a) 1 GHz sample rate, b) 10 channels, c) 2-bit (four-level)                    
              quantization, and d) 32-bit counter/accumulator.  It has already               
              been demonstrated experimentally that the 1 GHz sampling rate can              
              be achieved with a combination of systolic architecture, novel                 
              pipeline differential logic circuits, and a 1.0 um CMOS fabrication            
              process.  The objectives of Phase II are to increase the number of             
              channels per chip to 100 while maintaining the 1 GHz clock                     
              frequency and the 4-level quantization scheme.  Provision will also            
              be made for a number of features such as 1-bit correlation for                 
              solar burst observation, blanking of correlation coefficients for              
              pulsar observations, and phase switch mode.                                    
                                                                                             
              The commercial market for correlator chips is estimated at two to              
              five million dollars in 1992 and it will grow 15% to 20% annually.             
              Presently, most digital correlator chips are designed by each radio            
              astronomy laboratory for their own internal use.  The performance-             
              to-cost ratio of the proposed correlator chip will be up to 10                 
              times higher than that of existing correlators.
