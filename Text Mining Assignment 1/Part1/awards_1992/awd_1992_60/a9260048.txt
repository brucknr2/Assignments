Abstract    :
              The objective of the proposed research will be to experimentally               
              determine the usefulness of solid oxide fuel cells for promoting               
              the efficient electrochemical conversion of methane base fuels                 
              to electricity over the temperature range of 600-900 degrees C.                
              Experimental emphasis will be on anode electrocatalysts which                  
              incorporate lattice substituents which have shown previous                     
              evidence for direct oxidation of methane and their steam reform                
              products in the absence of carbon deposition. Fuel cells will                  
              be based on perovskites and a perovskite related brownmillerite.
