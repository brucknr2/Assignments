Abstract    :
              This proposal will explore a novel approach to achieving high                  
              performance analog to digital conversion through the use of very               
              efficient low speed ADCs (Analog-to-Digital Converters) operating              
              in parallel.  On chip circuitry can accommodate turnable                       
              prefiltering to band limit the signal to be digitized.                         
              Preamplification and/or demultiplexing make the proposed device                
              ideal for low-level multichannel signal acquisition from grid array            
              sensors in the field of biology and optical sensing.                           
                                                                                             
              The approach relies on combining hundreds of channels of single-               
              slope ADCs in a single IC.  Numerous ICs are stacked in a 3-D                  
              configuration described in the proposal.  The number of ICs per                
              stack is a variable, dependent on the application and conversion               
              bandwidth desired.  Simple stacks can contain greater than 1000 ADC            
              channels operating in parallel.  Even greater parallelism can be               
              obtained by assembling the stacks on a substrate so that greater               
              than 10,000 single-slope ADCs can be made to operate in parallel               
              in a package approximately 2 cubic inches.                                     
                                                                                             
              The proposed Phase I program will focus on specification                       
              generation, architecture development, and preliminary  packaging               
              design in order to determine feasibility of producing a prototype              
              in Phase II.
