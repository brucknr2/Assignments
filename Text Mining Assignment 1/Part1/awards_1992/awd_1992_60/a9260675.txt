Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              A mathematical model, using the dual-porosity concept, is                      
              proposed for the transport of contaminants in unsaturated                      
              fractured rocks.  The formation is visualized as a composite of                
              two overlapping continua, the porous mixtrix and the fractures.                
              These two media communicate via interporosity exchange mechanisms              
              that are functions of the difference in the solute concentration               
              (for the specie transport problem) or the pressure (for the fluid              
              flow problem) in the two media.  We will examine various                       
              mathematical representations of these intermedia exchange terms.               
              A special attention will be paid to radioactive waste.  The                    
              proposed model is the first step towards developing a                          
              comprehensive computer model for assessing the movement of                     
              pollutants in unsaturated fractured formations.  Our objective is              
              the establishment of a field-consistent mathematical model for                 
              the transport process in a variably saturated fractured rock.                  
              Approximate analytical solutions using parameter perturbation,                 
              asymptotic analyses and transform techniques will be obtained in               
              order to examine key characteristics of contaminant migration in               
              unsaturated fractured formations.
