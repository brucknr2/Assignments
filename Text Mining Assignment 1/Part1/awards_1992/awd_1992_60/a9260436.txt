Abstract    :
              We have demonstrated heterologous protein expression in Neurospora             
              crassa using two promoters - the glucose repressible promoter of               
              grg-1 and the constitutive promoter of the B-tubulin.  Neurospora              
              transformants expressing a bovine preprochymosin cDNA accumulate               
              soluble, enzymatically active mature chymosin in the culture                   
              medium.  One important element of heterologous protein expression              
              systems is the appropriate host strain, for which protease                     
              deficient mutants are often superior.  Neurospora secretes an                  
              alkaline protease in the presence of protein in the culture medium             
              when also starved for carbon, nitrogen, or sulfur.  When induced,              
              the alkaline protease comprises 40% of secreted proteins. We are               
              cloning cDNA and the genomic locus encoding the N. crassa secreted             
              alkaline protease in order to develop an improved host and                     
              additional expression vectors for expression of heterologous                   
              proteins.                                                                      
              %%%                                                                            
              The development of microbial systems for expression of heterologous            
              proteins has enabled the isolation of greater amounts of scarce                
              proteins, often in greater purity than is possible from the                    
              original source.  Proteins so expressed have applications ranging              
              from industrial use, through protein biochemistry research, to                 
              human therapeutics.  These clones will be used subsequently to                 
              create alkaline protease deficient disruption mutantions and to add            
              the protease promoter and secretion signal peptide to our                      
              expression vector repertoire.
