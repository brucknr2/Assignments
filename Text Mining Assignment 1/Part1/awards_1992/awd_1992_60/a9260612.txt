Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              A requirement exists for the acquisition, storage, and                         
              distribution of large numbers of micro-samples of DNA.  Using the              
              polymerase chain reaction and other methods, specific DNA                      
              sequences may be amplified from very small genomic starting                    
              samples.  If large libraries of DNA samples were available,                    
              individual researchers could attack a variety of interesting                   
              problems in taxonomy, evolution, population genetics, genetic                  
              screening for radiation and environmental mutagens, the                        
              validation of forensic DNA technology, and many others using PCR,              
              RFLP mapping and other readily available techniques.                           
                                                                                             
              LSB Corp.  proposes a systematic program to develop methods for                
              storing large numbers of DNA samples including dried cells, DNA-               
              enriched extracts, or purified DNA, with each sample encased in a              
              protective enclosure with attached identifying barcoding, all                  
              arranged for convenient storage and access.   LSB Corp. has                    
              developed and described several alternative prototypes for such a              
              storage system, together with methods for evaluating each.                     
              Additionally LSB Corp. has developed computerized analysis of                  
              RFLP, 2-D DNA, and other types of analytical images.
