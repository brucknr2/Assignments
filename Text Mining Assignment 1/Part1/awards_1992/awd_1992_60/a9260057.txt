Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              With the advent of polymer dispersed liquid crystals (PDLC),                   
              optically more efficient light valves (compared to TNLC                        
              technology) for projection LCD displays are now feasible, as                   
              polarizers are not needed for light modulation.  The same                      
              benefits cannot be achieved for direct-view displays as the                    
              diffuse backlight cannot be modulated by scattering with the same              
              efficiency as the highly collimated beam used in projection                    
              displays.  Dye has to be added to the PDLC formulation in order                
              to achieve an acceptable contrast.  However, by adding the dye to              
              the PDLC formulation, the optical efficiency of such a display                 
              becomes comparable to a standard TNLC display.  In order to                    
              improve the optical efficiency of direct-view displays, a new                  
              concept of micro-projection has been conceived wherein each pixel              
              becomes a miniaturized projector.  This display system can use a               
              PDLC without a dye.  Additional improvement is achieved by almost              
              full utilization of the available collimated light which can be                
              steered by a microlens array to pass by the opaque structures on               
              the active matrix substrate (AM circuitry) and color filter                    
              (black matrix).  Significantly brighter direct-view displays with              
              a contrast ratio of 100:1 should be achievable.
