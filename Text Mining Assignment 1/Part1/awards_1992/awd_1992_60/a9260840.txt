Abstract    :
              The phase I research will involve acoustic tomography and                      
              reflection imaging of concrete conditions using stress wave energy             
              to detect flaws such as void, honeycomb crackling and weak concrete            
              in concrete test wall models.  Key aspects of the research are                 
              implementation of a rapid scanning ultrasonic stress wave                      
              energy system that will be used to generate and measure compression            
              and shear wave energy.  A second key component of the research                 
              involves the adaptation of tomographic velocity and                            
              reflection/diffraction imaging methods from geophysics for                     
              evaluation of structural concrete conditions including both flaw               
              detection and reinforcement location.
