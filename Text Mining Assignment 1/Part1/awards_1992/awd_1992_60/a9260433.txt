Abstract    :
                   This project concerns the development of a technique for                  
              obtaining three-dimensional range images in real-time with                     
              accuracies of the order of 0.001.  Range image refers to an image              
              where the value of each pixel in the image represents the distance             
              from the camera's focal point to the corresponding point in the                
              scene.  In this mode, each pixel becomes a timer which measures the            
              time from the start of the frame until the scanning plane of light             
              crosses the pixel.  This timing information is readily converted               
              to distance information.  Thus, the procedure used is                          
              computationally simple.  The research includes development of the              
              software, calibration and evaluation of the measurement system, and            
              demonstration of the feasibility of close-in, high-speed, high-                
              precision inspection using the camera mounted on an available                  
              Stewart Platform.                                                              
                   Because the system produces high-accuracy three-dimensional               
              data in real-time, it can be potentially used for in-process                   
              control for a wide variety of manufacturing processes, so that                 
              errors in the parts as manufactured can be corrected more                      
              effectively.  The combination of the camera and the Stewart                    
              Platform, if successful, would make real-time dimensional                      
              inspection practical for many cases where it is not practical                  
              today.
