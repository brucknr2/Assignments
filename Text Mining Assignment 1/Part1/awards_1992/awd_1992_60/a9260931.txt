Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project                 
              proposes to develop an electronic raised-pin device that will                  
              provide visually-impaired readers with a Braille interface to a                
              computer.  Such an interface represents a significant advance                  
              beyond voice simulation systems.  The tactile display device                   
              would provide 25 lines of 40 characters each, thereby allowing                 
              the reader to scan a block of text, moving forward, backward, and              
              skipping over text.  Previous attempts to develop such a device                
              have produced no more than two lines of display, for which two-                
              handed Braille reading is unworkable.  The proposed research                   
              would explore ways of creating high pin density without a bulky                
              or heavy support system or excessive current demands.  The                     
              project addresses the need for blind scientists to have a                      
              computer controlled large tactile display enabling them to scan                
              large amounts of information and reflect on parts of the whole.
