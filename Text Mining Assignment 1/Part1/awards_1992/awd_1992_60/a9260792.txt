Abstract    :
                   There is a growing demand for inexpensive, sensitive and                  
              reliable humidity sensors with microprocessor-controlled                       
              electronics.  Next to temperature, humidity is the most important              
              variable in environmental measurement and control applications.                
              In terms of detrimental effects on the life and performance of                 
              electronic equipment and quality control in manufacturing, humidity            
              is often the more important parameter.  Humidity sensors have broad            
              industrial and domestic applications for increasing the reliability            
              and effective use of electronic equipment, as well as decreasing               
              energy consumption.                                                            
                   Most commercially available relative humidity sensors use                 
              hydrophilic hydrocarbon-based polymer films as humidity-sensing                
              elements.  However, they are not sufficiently resistive to water               
              or to elevated temperatures and cannot be used at high humidities              
              for extended periods of time.  In this project, the simple                     
              processing steps associated with an organic polymer will be taken              
              advantage of in fabricating a highly sensitive, stable and durable             
              humidity sensor.  Shortcomings encountered with hydrocarbon-based              
              polymers will be overcome by using highly stable proton-conducting             
              fluorocarbon polymer materials.  These materials have an                       
              established performance record in electrochemical system, e.g.,                
              fuel cells and chlor-alkali electrolyzers, under highly oxidizing              
              and aggressive environments.  The physical and chemical properties             
              associated with proton-conducting fluorocarbon polymers make them              
              very attractive as the sensing elements in humidity sensors.
