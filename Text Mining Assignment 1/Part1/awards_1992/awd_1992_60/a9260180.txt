Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  The hydroperoxyl radical plays an important role in the                   
              photochemistry of both the troposphere and the stratosphere.  In               
              the troposphere, HO2 participates in ozone formation chemistry in              
              urban environments.  Recombination of HO2 is the only known source             
              of atmospheric hydrogen peroxide, which is important in the                    
              chemistry of acid precipitation.  Direct measurements of                       
              atmospheric hydroperoxyl radical concentrations would provide                  
              important data for use in testing and improving models of                      
              atmospheric photochemistry.                                                    
                                                                                             
                   The proposed research will utilize near-infrared diode lasers             
              to measure tropospheric HO2 concentrations by absorption in                    
              spectroscopic bands near 1500 nm.  This approach offers improved               
              sensitivity, as compared to mid-infrared methods, due to the high              
              power and improved optical characteristics of near-infrared diode              
              lasers.  In Phase I, laboratory experiments will be conducted to               
              measure the absorption cross sections of HO2 near 1500 nm.  The                
              results of these experiments will provide a basis for critical                 
              assessment of the feasibility of this technique for tropospheric               
              measurements and will establish the crucial design parameters for              
              development of field instrumentation in Phase II.
