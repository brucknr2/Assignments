Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This study is concerned with synthesizing, for gas                             
              separations, new polymeric membranes which will have both high                 
                                                                                             
              permeability and selectivity.  The PI focuses on substituted                   
                                                                                             
              polyacetylene membranes, and notes that of this class PTMSP                    
                                                                                             
              (poly(trimethylhysilylpropyne): ?(C(CH3) = C(Si(CH3)3)n!) has                  
                                                                                             
              the highest permeability to most gases of any known polymer.                   
              However, its selectivity is very poor; for example its O2/N2                   
              selectivity is only 1.8.  The high permeability is due to the                  
                                                                                             
              stiff backbone, and to the fact that the attached                              
              trimethysilyl group is very bulky.  Both factors limit                         
              efficient packing of the polymer chains, resulting in a large                  
                                                                                             
              free volume which accounts for the permeability.  To improve                   
              the selectivity, the PI intends to reduce the free volume size                 
                                                                                             
              to increase the selectivity at the expense of some                             
              permeability.                                                                  
                                                                                             
              To decrease the free volume, this study will follow two                        
              strategies;  (a) The first is to develop thermal annealing                     
                                                                                             
              procedures which result in membranes in which the chains are                   
                                                                                             
              in a more relaxed state that promotes better packing and a                     
              lower free volume. (b) The second strategy is to copolymerize                  
                                                                                             
              high permeability low selectivity polymers with aryl                           
              substituted polyacetylenes that have high selectivity.  The                    
              idea is that the aryl groups should promote polymer chain                      
              cohesion, and that thermally annealed copolymers can be                        
              developed with the desired balance of values of permeability                   
                                                                                             
              and selectivity.
