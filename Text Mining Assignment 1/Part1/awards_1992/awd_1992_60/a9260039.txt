Abstract    :
                   The potential advantage of thermoplastic matrix composites for            
              manufacturing low-cost components has yet to be realized.  An                  
              important factor limiting thermoplastic composites is the lack of              
              a low-cost method for producing high-quality prepregs and preforms.            
              A method for producing the materials that are compatible with                  
              commonly used composite fabrication techniques such as filament                
              winding, pultrusion, and prepregging will be researched.                       
                   The method uses the self-charging effect that occurs when the             
              fiber tow is dragged through a powder bed.  When optimized, this               
              approach could make thermoplastic matrix composites competitive                
              with current thermoset matrix composites.
