Abstract    :
              Complex digital systems are typically prototyped using large arrays            
              of PWB/rack mounted field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs), a                  
              lengthy and costly task.  This project will utilize a 3D IC stack              
              containing 32 to 128 FPGAs on an active substrate that occupies                
              approximately 1 cubic centimeter and provides all the logic,                   
              interconnect and I/O necessary to prototype a complex computational            
              system.  Due to the close proximity of the ICs to each other and               
              to the active substrate, significant power, speed and reliability              
              improvements over conventional prototyping boards are possible.                
              Existing FPGA programming tools can be extended to provide quick               
              turn-around design/programming of this system.  Using this concept,            
              prototyping time can be significantly reduced.  This is especially             
              useful in: redesign/re-prototyping situations where the design must            
              be rapidly modified; hardware based simulation accelerators; shared            
              resource situations where one prototype system must (could) be                 
              shared among several programs; and low-quantity custom systems                 
              where the "prototype" could become the "product".  The Rapid                   
              Prototyping Module (RPM) will provide significant advantages in                
              development cost and time-to-market for those companies having                 
              access to this technology.
