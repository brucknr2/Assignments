Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Low cost workstations and increasingly powerful PCs now make it                
              feasible for a computer to record experimental data and make                   
              high-level analyses of the results for many classes of                         
              neuroscience experiments; the computer should further be able to               
              determine autonomously when statistically valid results have been              
              accumulated, recognize and repeat defective or failed                          
              measurements, appropriately alter experiment parameters and                    
              protocol, and even recognize unexpected opportunities and adjust               
              protocol to take advantage of them.  While the best of current                 
              generation of experiment control software supports on-line                     
              analysis and decision making, it requires sophisticated                        
              programming skills to implement these capabilities, and the                    
              experiment must pause to analyze results and evaluate control                  
              logic.  This causes a loss of experiment time.  We propose                     
              research on a Real-Time Expert System Experiment Controller that               
              will:  1) capture data from a laboratory's present control                     
              computer; 2) perform sophisticated analyses on incoming results;               
              3) make experiment control decision of the sort presently made by              
              the experimenter (basing them on the experimenter's priorities,                
              reasoning methods, statistical criteria and rules of thumb, which              
              are encoded in the expert system's knowledge base as a                         
              hierarchical set of interdependent hypotheses; 4) either directly              
              command the present control computer to implement its decisions,               
              allowing the experimenter to manipulate priorities and high level              
              control variables to influence the way the controller allocates                
              effort; 5) or convey recommendations to the experimenter so he                 
              may make the ultimate decisions.                                               
                                                                                             
              Such a system should improve experiment flow decision by                       
              increasing the sophistication of analysis on which they are                    
              based.  The proposed research will evaluate the Controller's                   
              performance, suggesting design improvements and validating the                 
              concept of expert system experiment control.  Success will lead                
              to improved productivity and cost-effectiveness of neuroscience                
              research that is amenable to computer control.
