Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project                 
              has as its objective the development of software which will                    
              instruct in the detection of environmental radiation.  In                      
              particular, the investigators proposal to build a computer system              
              that will simulate the presence of various types of radiation                  
              sources in a variety of environments.  This system will have                   
              three modules, (1) Surveyor, (2) Radiation Physics Laboratory,                 
              and (3) Examination.  The Surveyor will simulate an environment                
              where radiation exposure potential exists.  This module will be                
              connected to an instrument that the trainee can hold in his/her                
              hand.  The Radiation Physics Laboratory module will teach the                  
              principles of various types of radiation, and the Examination                  
              module, based on the Survey will test the knowledge of the                     
              trainee of the properties of various types of radiation and the                
              ability of the trainee in the radiation environment.  The                      
              availability of simulation software will enhance the safety of                 
              the students who study radiation measurement in hazardous                      
              environments, and it will permit the simulation of malfunctions                
              which cannot now be demonstrated because of their danger.
