Abstract    :
              This project addresses the general need for efficient, robust                  
              systems for encoding and processing spatial information by                     
              developing a prototype programmable spatial memory system for                  
              application in robotic systems and autonomous vehicles.  Frequency             
              and phase relationships between oscillators--representing objects              
              in the application environment--will be examined as possible                   
              distance and direction encoding mechanisms.  This prototype system             
              is based on a Hybrid Temporal Processing Element (HTPE) developed              
              by and available exclusively to Intelligent Reasoning Systems.  The            
              HTPE is a general purpose model neuron that combines analog and                
              digital signal processing capabilities with low component count,               
              low power dissipation, and high processing speed.
