Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project                 
              has as its objective the development of interactive multimedia                 
              science and mathematics courseware for grades K-3 using                        
              storytelling, sing-alongs, and nonaggressive games.  An important              
              focus of these methods of instruction is on introducing science                
              and mathematics in an encouraging way to primary-level female                  
              students.  By providing an early intervention to counteract the                
              trend among female students, who begin to lose interest at this                
              age, the proposal addresses a major problem in US education                    
              today:  alienation of females from the math/science enterprise.
