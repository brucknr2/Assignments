Abstract    :
                  The project concerns evaluation of a new machining technique               
              which combines elements of wire Electro Discharge Machining (EDM)              
              and Electro Chemical Machining (ECM). The metal removal process                
              involves the anodic dissolution of the workpiece in close proximity            
              to a moving wire. A prototype single-axis wire ECM machine will be             
              built to prove the concept, in addition to detailed theoretical                
              analysis.                                                                      
                   Such a machine, if it is successfully built and tested, would             
              have the advantages of wire EDM without its adverse heat treatment             
              effects on the machined surface. Also, in such a machine, high                 
              fluid pressures would not be needed, reducing machine and tooling              
              stresses and avoiding one of the main disadvantages of conventional            
              ECM.
