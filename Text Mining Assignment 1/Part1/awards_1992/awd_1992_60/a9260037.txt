Abstract    :
              This is an award to support research on development of a flue gas              
              monitoring system for determination of the potential air                       
              contaminants in emissions of gases from combustion processes.                  
              The system is based on the application of principles derived from              
              use of Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy in monitoring                   
              nitrogen, sulfur and chlorine in an on-line, diagnostic                        
              instrument that can be used for determination of the quality of                
              effluent gas streams.                                                          
                                                                                             
              Exhaust gases from combustion of fossil fuels and from combustion              
              of solid wastes results in the production of byproduct gases that              
              pollute air into which they are discharged.  Results of this                   
              project are expected to determine the feasibility of producing an              
              instrument that could be used to monitor nitrogen and sulfur                   
              oxides and air toxics such as hydrogen chloride in exhaust gases               
              from combustion processes.  The proposal leading to this award                 
              was submitted in response to NSF 92-30, Small Business Innovation              
              Research under Topic No. 25d, Environmental Systems.
