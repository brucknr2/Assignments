Abstract    :
              This proposal outlines a research                                              
              program to develop a non-invasive                                              
              temperature sensor for application                                             
              in dry etching (plasma etching,                                                
              reactive ion etching for example)                                              
              of electronic materials.  There is                                             
              a critical need for such sensors at                                            
              present since the temperature of

              In addition, the photoresist used                                              
              for masking begins to char at                                                  
              elevated temperatures.  Hence, it                                              
              is important to measure and monitor                                            
              the wafer temperature at all times.                                            
              The proposed effort would result in                                            
              a novel temperature sensor to

              is that the proposed technique                                                 
              would enable a non-invasive,

              contrast, existing techniques are                                              
              invasive and cumbersome and the

              The proposed research is to                                                    
              investigate photoreflectance as a                                              
              temperature sensor for the above                                               
              purpose.  The energy gap of the                                                
              semiconductor material would be

              surface temperature.  The Phase I

              The Phase II effort would result in                                            
              a prototype instrument and
