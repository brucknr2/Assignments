Abstract    :
              9260109  Akcakaya    The main goal of this project is to produce software that
              will  combine a geographic information system (GIS), which analyzes and 
              predicts changes in the structure of a species' habitat, with a  population
              model that estimates the extinction risk of the  species that utilizes the
              habitat.  The software will enable  realistic estimates for the purposes of
              environmental impact  assessment and conservation biology activities.  Examples
              of  areas where such estimates are important include assessment of  the impact
              of human activities, such as forestry practices, road  building, agricultural
              expansion, and dam construction, on the  fate of endangered and threatened
              species; optimum design of  nature reserves (the selection of habitats that
              will maximize the  survival chance of a particular species); and the optimal
              choice  of wildlife management practices (such as reintroductions and 
              translocations).  The research will involve development of  algorithms to
              produce, export and interpret habitat maps,  programs to predict future
              suitability of habitats for particular  species due to changes in land-use
              patterns, and software for  building population models for species that live in
              multiple  patches that change through time, such as in fragmented habitats.
