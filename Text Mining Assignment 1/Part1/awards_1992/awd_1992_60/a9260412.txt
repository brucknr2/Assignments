Abstract    :
                   Tuning the wavelength of lasers is basic to many uses of                  
              light.  This research activity will develop a new mechanism                    
              for electronically tuning lasers.  The objectives are to make                  
              more rapidly tunable lasers that are efficient and reliable.                   
              The tuning method is by suppressing unwanted longitudinal                      
              cavity modes, or equivalently unwanted wavelengths.  The loss                  
              mechanism is based on a coupling between a laser cavity's                      
              fundamental transverse mode we wish to suppress and a higher-                  
              order higher-loss transverse mode of the same laser cavity.                    
              The coupling is by an acousto-optic modulator in the cavity.                   
              A successful Phase I and Phase II program will produce tunable                 
              continuously-emitting and pulsed lasers relevant to a wide                     
              range of research and measurement applications.
