Abstract    :
              The proposed research is concerned with the use of low                         
              temperature solid electrolytes in fuel cells. The proposed                     
              research addresses the material requirements for low electronic                
              and high ionic conductivity. The proposed approach is the                      
              formation of a two layer composite electrolyte. The first layer                
              will be a CeO2 -based or perovskite-based solid electrolyte with               
              high ionic conductivity upon which a thin layer of zirconia is                 
              deposited, using electrochemical vapor deposition, to block the                
              electronic current.
