Abstract    :
              This is an award to support research on reducing the content of                
              methane in exhaust gases from vehicles using methane as a fuel.                
              The objective of this project is to determine the feasibility of               
              combining the methane-activating function of partial oxidation                 
              catalysts and the strong chemisorptive properties of deep                      
              oxidation catalysts into catalysts that will be active for deep                
              methane oxidation at temperatures significantly lower than now                 
              necessary to be used with currently used platinum catalysts.                   
                                                                                             
              Exhaust gases from combustion of methane in vehicles utilizing                 
              methane as a fuel contain significant amounts of methane.  This                
              is likely to impede movement toward acceptability of vehicles                  
              that utilize methane for a fuel.  Results of this project are                  
              expected to determine whether the passage of exhaust gases                     
              through the catalysts synthesized in this project will reduce the              
              emissions of methane from vehicles using it as a fuel.  The                    
              proposal leading to this award was submitted in response to NSF
