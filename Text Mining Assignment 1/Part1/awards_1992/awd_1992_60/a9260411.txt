Abstract    :
                   This research suggests a new technique for fabricating high               
              speed steel by dispersing nanosized oxide particles instead of                 
              carbide precipitates within the iron-based matrix. Due to the                  
              chemical stability and smaller size of the oxide dispersoids, the              
              proposed material should exhibit high strength well above 600                  
              degrees C, unlike conventional high speed steels. The processes                
              involved in the manufacture will be studied here, including firstly            
              the production of iron powder with the uniformly dispersed oxides              
              and secondly the consolidation of the powder by casting or standard            
              powder metallurgy.                                                             
                   Other benefits of the proposed material may be improved                   
              grindability and fracture toughness, due to the very small size and            
              greater homogeneity of the oxide dispersoids within the iron-based             
              matrix. Some of the high costs of conventional alloying would also             
              be avoided. The research method therefore offers an attractive                 
              alternative to producing superior high speed tooling material.
