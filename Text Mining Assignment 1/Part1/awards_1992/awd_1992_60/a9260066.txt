Abstract    :
              A fast and high sensitivity time-resolved spectrofluorometer is                
              proposed to develop into a commercial project.  In contrast with               
              the classical fluorometric method, such as time-correlated single              
              photon counting and phase modulation, the novel instrument is                  
              based on the introduction of two recently developed techniques:                
              a) single pulse laser excitation and nanosecond waveform                       
              analyzing by electronic imaging, and b) acoustooptical tunable                 
              filter as an electronically controlled monochromator.  The                     
              instruments have the capability of simultaneously acquiring a                  
              complete set of decay and spectral curve sufficient for the                    
              construction of a 3-D manifold within 1 second.  The sensitivity               
              of the instrument can be as high as at femtomole (10-15 mole) and              
              attomole (10-18 mole) level.  These are far beyond the                         
              capabilities of current instruments.  The instrument is compact,               
              lightweight, low-cost, suitable for and will facilitate wide                   
              applications of the fluoroscopic method.  Phase I will                         
              demonstrate the feasibility and Phase II will develop a                        
              prototype.  The long-term goal is to use the method to develop                 
              numerous specialized instruments for basic research as well as                 
              for clinical and industrial applications.
