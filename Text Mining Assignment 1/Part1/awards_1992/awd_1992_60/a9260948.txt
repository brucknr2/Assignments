Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project                 
              proposes to develop and assess a package consisting of sound and               
              laser experiments to be carried out by middle school students and              
              a subsequent, more advanced demonstration and a delivery system                
              for sharing the materials and equipment in the package.  The                   
              materials and equipment will be developed so that not only can                 
              illuminating scientific experiments be carried out, but that                   
              these can be done using equipment and materials that lend                      
              themselves well to travel and sharing.  The short term rental                  
              system would enable middle schools to share these materials and                
              equipment at low cost, and it would be strengthened by onsite                  
              training and support of teachers and a hotline.
