Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Many applications in materials research and production require                 
              accurate, non-contact surface temperature measurements on various              
              materials under a variety of conditions.  All such surfaces emit               
              radiation, which may be used as a measure of their surface                     
              temperature, providing the surface's emissivity is known.                      
              Unfortunately, emissivity values are usually uncertain, which leads            
              to errors in conventional pyrometry.  This proposal concerns a new             
              active pyrometer method, wherein the ratio of target reflectances              
              at two separate wavelengths is measured together with the target               
              radiances at these same wavelengths.  From these values the surface            
              emissivity may be determined and the target temperature accurately             
              measured for materials having arbitrary surface textures.  Quantum             
              Logic Corporation has developed and markets a line of single-                  
              wavelength laser-based active pyrometers, but they are effective               
              only for targets known in advance to have diffusely scattering or              
              perfectly specular surfaces.  Also, the semiconductor lasers                   
              required for these instruments are available only at wavelengths               
              suitable for very high temperature measurements.  We plan to                   
              develop a two-wavelength active pyrometer as described above                   
              employing non-coherent radiation sources which will be suitable for            
              a very wide range of temperatures and for targets having arbitrary             
              surface textures, thereby greatly extending the applications of                
              active pyrometer technology.
