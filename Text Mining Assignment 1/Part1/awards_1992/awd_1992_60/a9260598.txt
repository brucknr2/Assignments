Abstract    :
              For electric car applications, the nickel-iron storage battery                  
                                                                                            
              can offer up to 75% higher energy density when compared to the                 
                                                                                             
              lead-acid battery. However, because of the ease of hydrogen                    
              evolution at the iron anodes, this battery suffers from poor                   
                                                                                             
              charging efficiency and a high self-discharge rate. Both factors               
              degrade energy efficiency. The proposed research will examine                  
                                                                                             
              a range of electrolyte additives to determine their                            
              effectiveness in inhibiting the energy-wasting hydrogen                        
              evolution reaction on iron electrodes.
