Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              In many cases of ground water pollution, in situ bioremediation                
              may be the only cost-effective, time-efficient treatment                       
              technology.  Successful treatment, however, may require the                    
              presence of metabolically capable bacteria in the polluted target              
              zone.  In the absence of a favorable ground water gradient, the                
              problem becomes one of installing enough injection and recovery                
              wells to draw nutrients or metabolically active bacteria through               
              the contaminated zone.  Electrokinetics has been proposed as an                
              in situ treatment technology for drawing charged contaminants                  
              through soil and aquifer solids to a recovery well.  Preliminary               
              studies have shown that one can use this same technology                       
              directionally to transport microorganisms through model aquifer                
              solids.  Envirogen Inc. proposes to optimize and demonstrate this              
              technology with bacteria capable of degrading trichloroethylene                
              (TCE, vinyl chloride, dichloroethylene and other related                       
              contaminants from the surface of aquifer materials.
