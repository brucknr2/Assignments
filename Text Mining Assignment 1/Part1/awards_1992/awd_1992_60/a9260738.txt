Abstract    :
              This is an award to support research on a technology based upon                
              use of a microporous hollow fiber membrane for removal of radon                
              from water contaminated with this gas.  In the process being                   
              investigated in this project, radon would be stripped from the                 
              water by passage through a microporous hollow fiber "gas"                      
              membrane operated under vacuum created either by a water-operated              
              aspirator or by a vacuum pump.  The evacuated radon would be                   
              concentrated in the liquid side stream used to produce the vacuum              
              or an alternative recirculating sidestream.   The redissolved                  
              radon in the sidestream would be removed by adsorption on                      
              granular activated carbon in liquid suspension.                                
                                                                                             
              This proposal was submitted in response to NSF 92-30, Small                    
              Business Innovation Research under Topic No. 25d, Environmental                
              Systems.  It addresses removal of radon from water supplies                    
              contaminated with this gas.  The process is expected to be                     
              especially attractive to water utilities that must remove radon                
              but are restrained from its emission to the atmosphere.
