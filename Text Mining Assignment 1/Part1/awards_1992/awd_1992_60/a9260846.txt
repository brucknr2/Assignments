Abstract    :
              The goal of this project is to                                                 
              develop biodegradable                                                          
              microparticles for drug delivery                                               
              that could be easily and                                                       
              reproducibly suspended in saline                                               
              for injection.  Biodegradable                                                  
              microparticles are being studied                                               
              extensively as a means to deliver a                                            
              wide variety of drugs in a                                                     
              controlled manner.  Technology now                                             
              allow desired release profiles to                                              
              be achieved by judicious choice of                                             
              biodegradable polymers, particle                                               
              size, and drug loading.  The                                                   
              release profiles may last from                                                 
              weeks to years, depending upon the                                             
              materials and parameters used.                                                 
                                                                                             
              One significant obstacle to                                                    
              controlled drug delivery systems is                                            
              the difficulty encountered in                                                  
              administering these microparticles                                             
              by injection.  The particles have a                                            
              tendency to settle quickly in                                                  
              saline.    This makes it difficult                                             
              to administer the entire injection                                             
              volume and also causes the                                                     
              microparticles to clump in the                                                 
              needle of the syringe, making an                                               
              injection impossible.  Using                                                   
              viscous injection media is                                                     
              currently the procedure used to                                                
              attempt to inject biodegradable                                                
              microparticles.  This research                                                 
              involves a novel, proprietary                                                  
              method with which biodegradable                                                
              microparticles containing drugs can                                            
              be surface treated so that they can                                            
              be suspended in aqueous media for                                              
              long periods of time.  The novel                                               
              technique is based on a proprietary                                            
              processes of the star-burst type.
