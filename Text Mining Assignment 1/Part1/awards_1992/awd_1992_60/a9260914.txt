Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Commercial machine vision was introduced in the 1970's.  To this               
              point it has not been used widely for automation in manufacturing              
              due to performance, complexity, and cost issues.  Most commercial              
              vision systems are based on video technology with separate                     
              cameras, frame grabbers, digitizers and processors.  Reliance on               
              video technology limits performance and requires expensive,                    
              complete architectures.  The maximum video frame rate is 30 per                
              second and the average complete system costs over $20,000.                     
                                                                                             
              In 1991 DVT introduced the first commercial Integrated Vision                  
              System.  The new gray scale vision technology is simple, compact,              
              and inexpensive.  Priced under $2,000., this technology packages               
              the functionality of commercial gray scale vision systems into                 
              one device, the size of a book, weighing less than 2 pounds.  The              
              improvements offered by this new technology are changing the                   
              market for vision as many more applications have become                        
              economically feasible.                                                         
                                                                                             
              This research will develop a color integrated vision system.                   
              Based on currently available CCDs, the research will result in                 
              development of a new technology for directly digitizing and                    
              processing color optical information.  Devices based on this                   
              technology will provide the ability to perform low cost, high                  
              speed quality control and verification for automated                           
              manufacturing.
