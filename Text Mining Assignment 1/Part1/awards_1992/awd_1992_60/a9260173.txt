Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Sodium-beta (Na-beta)-alumina is the solid electrolyte membrane                
              used in sodium-sulfur batteries with applications in load leveling,            
              electric automobiles, and satellite communications.  A novel method            
              for the fabrication of thin (20 to 50 micrometers) Na-beta-alumina             
              solid electrolytes will be undertaken.  This method, known as                  
              electrochemical vapor deposition (EVD), has been used successfully             
              to deposit zirconia, perovskites, and ceria for applications in                
              solid oxide fuel cells.  The method consists of reacting gaseous               
              species to form a thin membrane of Na-beta-alumina over a porous               
              support, further growth of which occurs by EVD.  An EVD reactor                
              will be built.  Na-beta-alumina membranes will be deposited using              
              two processes; a one step and a two step process.  The membranes               
              will be characterized with regards to microstructure, crystal                  
              structure and conductivity.
