Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Corrosion fatigue failure and methods to develop life prediction               
              schemes for this failure mode will be studied.  The approach will              
              be based on using the da/dN crack growth data to establish the                 
              stress-life curves in fatigue.  Special attention will be paid to              
              mean stress effects, rate of loading and long lives of relevance               
              to power plants.  The research will also aid manufacturing                     
              processes which produce different residual stress levels hence                 
              different material behaviors.  Concepts of J-Integral will be                  
              used in handling crack growth both in the low cycle fatigue and                
              high cycle fatigue regime.
