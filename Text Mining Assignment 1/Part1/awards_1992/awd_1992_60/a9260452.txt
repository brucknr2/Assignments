Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The black-lip pearl oyster, Pinctada margaritifera, is the source              
              of rare, valuable black pearls.  Culture of this species has                   
              proven highly lucrative in French Polynesia, with strengthening                
              worldwide demand.                                                              
                                                                                             
              The Hawaiian sub-species, P. margaritifera galtsoffi, is on the                
              Hawaii State endangered species list.  Stocks are scarce due to                
              both natural recruitment limitations and the history of                        
              overfishing for pearl shell.  The development of black pearl                   
              culture in Hawaii appears limited only by this scarcity.  This                 
              sub-species attains a large maximum size, and has excellent nacre              
              color, and should therefore produce excellent black pearls.                    
                                                                                             
              We propose to develop a hatchery for P. margaritifera galtsoffi,               
              in Kona, Hawaii.  Standard bivalve culture methods will be                     
              adapted to this species.  We are familiar with methods used in                 
              hatchery culture of other pearl oysters, and have confirmed the                
              availability of local broodstocks.                                             
                                                                                             
              Experiments will test methods of spawning induction, water                     
              quality, larval handling, algal rations, preferred substrates and              
              cues for settlement.  if successful settlement is achieved,                    
              subsequent trials will determine the feasibility of commercial-                
              scale spat production.                                                         
                                                                                             
              We must acquire our own pearl oyster hatchery technology if                    
              America is to compete with Japan, Australia, and other countries               
              for a stake in this lucrative market.
