Abstract    :
                   Long-length remote sensor is proposed that will act as both               
              a gas species detection, identification, and quantification                    
              system (GSDIQS), and a temperature measuring system (TMS).                     
              Particularly for use in downhole geothermal well logging, the                  
              GSDIQS will use Raman scattering as the optical method to measure              
              such as CO2 and H2O vapor.                                                     
                                                                                             
                   Problems of fiber background have been solved through the                 
              use of holographic and dielectric filters, and the use of a laser              
              diode source and telecommunication fiber-optics has extended the               
              sensor lengths to 10 km.  The TMS uses the same graded-index                   
              fiber-optic and diode source, and uses the fluorescence amplitude              
              dependence of Er:Glass with temperature (or other material) as                 
              the near-IR temperature sensing mechanism.
