Abstract    :
              This proposed aircraft landing system uses the Global Positioning              
              System (GPS) in conjunction with special purpose ground equipment              
              to provide a highly accurate, fully autonomous, portable precision             
              approach and landing system.  The aircraft receiver can also be                
              used to support en-route navigation and non-precision approaches               
              when out of range of the ground station.  Under Phase I, the GPS               
              precision approach and landing system will be designed to operate              
              in the extreme Antarctic environment.  The proposed precision                  
              approach and landing system will significantly improve safety at               
              NSF facilities in Antarctica.  GPS provides the capability of an               
              "all-weather" landing system that can function equally well at                 
              fixed installations, filed sites, and can even operate on moving               
              landing sites such as ice drifts without any degradation in                    
              performance.
