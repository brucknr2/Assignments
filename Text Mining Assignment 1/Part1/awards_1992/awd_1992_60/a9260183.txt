Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Recent experiments in Great Britain and Japan demonstrated s                   
              hundred-fold enhancement of convective and boiling heat                        
              transfer by the application of DC or low frequency electrical                  
              fields.  Also, in the case of boiling heat transfer, the mean                  
              bubble detachment time was reduced and boiling hysteresis                      
              eliminated.  However, the technique, as it had been developed,                 
              is applicable only to insulating fluids and cannot work for                    
              water, due to heating associated with the current.  The                        
              proposed method attempts to overcome this difficulty by                        
              applying high field gradients in the form of narrow pulses.                    
              Electric heating would be reduced by using low duty cycles.                    
              The proposed research will study the pulsed concept and its                    
              effect on convective and boiling heat transfer in liquids.
