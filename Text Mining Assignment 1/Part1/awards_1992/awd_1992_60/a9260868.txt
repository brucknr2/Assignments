Abstract    :
              This Phase I SBIR project proposes a field                                     
              adaptation and evaluation of a prototype in situ                               
              geotechnical testing system for earthquake                                     
              resistance.  The system is to provide reliable                                 
              estimates for soil deposits of the in situ cyclic shear                        
              vs strain characteristics needed by dynamic                                    
              earthquake analyses such as liquefaction, cyclic                               
              degradation and deformation, and undegraded                                    
              nonlinear inelastic characteristics.                                           
                                                                                             
              Problems to be addressed include reliably                                      
              predicting amplified motions, liquefaction, and                                
              deformations of soil deposits - sources of                                     
              significant seismic loss.  While this area has been                            
              advanced considerably, fundamental improvements                                
              in estimating soil characteristics are still greatly                           
              needed.  Earthquake-like cyclic loads are to be                                
              applied.  Tests, however, are to be conducted in                               
              situ with many steps to preserve in situ conditions.                           
              Recent laboratory prototype tests show promise in                              
              the proposed approach and the potential is good to                             
              apply it to retrofitting of existing critical                                  
              constructed facilities for earthquake resistance and                           
              in land use planning for seismically active areas.
