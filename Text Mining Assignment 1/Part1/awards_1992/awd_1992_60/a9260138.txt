Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  Recent concern over the depletion of the ozone layer has                  
              highlighted the need for improved instrumentation for measuring                
              solar ultraviolet light.  The proposed program would lead to the               
              development of low cost detectors with spectral sensitivities in               
              the UV regions of current scientific interest.  The detectors would            
              be based on fluorescent phosphor technology.  In Phase I of the                
              program the appropriate inorganic fluorescing phosphors would be               
              selected and their efficiency and spectral responses fully                     
              characterized as a function of temperature, grain size and layer               
              thickness.  The final mechanical and electronic design of the                  
              detectors would be carried out in Phase II.
