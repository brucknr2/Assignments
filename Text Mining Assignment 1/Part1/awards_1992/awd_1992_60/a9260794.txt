Abstract    :
              Difficulties in programming autonomous robots continue to impede               
              widespread application of automation.  High level programming                  
              capability that permits the user to think in terms of the complete             
              task as opposed to the individual movements required o the robot               
              does not yet exist.  This research explores a procedure through                
              which a robot is programmed, in a user-friendly manner, as the                 
              operator or programmer physically demonstrates several strategies              
              for accomplishing the task.  After a small number of                           
              demonstrations, the robot controller would then be capable of                  
              performing the task autonomously, driven by its unique, internally             
              developed program.  In essence, the upgrade path from pure teach               
              pendant programming or master/slave operation occurs invisibly to              
              the user and does not require a conventional program to be written             
              by the user for the autonomous subtask.
