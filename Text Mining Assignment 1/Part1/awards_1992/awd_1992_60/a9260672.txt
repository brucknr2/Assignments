Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Development of hypersonic aircraft requires a high degree of                   
              system integration.  Design tools are needed that can provide                  
              rapid, accurate calculations of complex fluid flow patterns.                   
              Existing methods, while reasonably accurate, are much too                      
              efficient design.  This project addresses that need.  The                      
              application of neural networks will be used to model coolant flow              
              patterns.                                                                      
                                                                                             
              First, the ability of neural networks to model coolant flow will               
              be demonstrated at the component level.  A single heat exchanger               
              component will be modeled by a neural network and trained using                
              data generated by the existing flow equations.  Then multiple                  
              components in series within a flow leg will be modeled using a                 
              series of neural networks.  Next these legs will be joined in                  
              parallel to form a heat exchanger panel.  Finally, various                     
              combinations of panels in series and parallel will be molded                   
              using hierarchical neural networks.  A combination of neural                   
              network software and computational hardware will be proposed for               
              a potential Phase II effort in which this computational                        
              capability will be made user friendly and accessible to design                 
              engineers with minimal neural network background.
