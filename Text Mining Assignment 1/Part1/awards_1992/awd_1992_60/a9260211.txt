Abstract    :
              Each year windthrown trees produce                                             
              millions of dollars in damages to                                              
              structures, lifelines, and                                                     
              vehicles.  In hurricanes or                                                    
              tornadoes this type of debris may                                              
              even cause injury and death.  This                                             
              work will investigate mitigation                                               
              procedures by coupling the results                                             
              from research on tree loading and                                              
              response to blast waves with

              as the effects of tree removal
