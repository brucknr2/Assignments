Abstract    :
              Mechanical Systems Simulation (MSS) is the technology                          
              associated with the analysis of systems undergoing large                       
              overall motion.  An automobile performing a lane change                        
              maneuver at 55 mph and a space shuttle orbiting the earth                      
              while performing satellite retrievel, are typical examples.                    
              The stability and efficiency of the numerical solutions for                    
              these systems and consequently the reliability of systems                      
              analyzed, is dependent on the choice of system coordinates,                    
              equation formation procedures, and numerical methods.  Yet                     
              commercially available MSS codes only support, even espouse,                   
              a single choice.                                                               
                                                                                             
              This project is to develop a symbolic computation based                        
              software that will allow for user-defined choices for these                    
              factors.  In stages, the necessary functions and data                          
              structures for symbolic expression manipulation, system                        
              definition, coordinates selection, equation formulation, and                   
              numerical methods will be created.  System equations will be                   
              symbolically generated and stored in canonical form for                        
              subsequent translation into formats for viewing the equations                  
              (TEX) or computing the system response (FORTRAN, C++).
