Abstract    :
              As electric power utilities are faced with the                                 
              prospect of operating under conditions of ever                                 
              increasing complexity, the need for accurate system                            
              modeling is becoming paramount.  Utilities must be                             
              able to accurately predict the response of their                               
              system due to the installation of new devices or the                           
              operation of their existing system closer to                                   
              constraint boundaries.  It is essential that power                             
              system simulation models reflect the characteristics                           
              of the actual system as accurately as possible.  This                          
              research would use an innovative approach to lay                               
              the foundation for an analysis package that would                              
              accurately determine the modeling parameters of                                
              synchronous generators using standstill and on-line                            
              measurement techniques.  The proposed research                                 
              would establish the feasibility of using a Prony-                              
              based algorithm to extract data from various                                   
              synchronous machine test procedures that have                                  
              recently been developed for frequency domain                                   
              parameter identification.  It is thought that this new                         
              approach, if found to be feasible, will reduce the                             
              risk of damage to the synchronous machines under                               
              test, provide for faster determination of the                                  
              required parameters, provide for better noise                                  
              rejection in evaluating the retrieved waveforms, and                           
              be more cost effective to utilities and regulatory                             
              agencies.
