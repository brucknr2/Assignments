Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Daggett Surveying Inc. will use a controlled archaeological context            
              to develop remote sensing techniques. Using a commercially                     
              available thermographic scanner they will image the variations in              
              ground surface temperature differences caused by differential                  
              evaporation rates of vadose water. Variation, they believe is                  
              affected by subsurface disturbances such as soil compaction and                
              buried structures that comprise an archaeological site. They will              
              scan in the middle to far-infrared wavelengths in the range from 2             
              to 14 micrometers. In addition to real-time display, data will be              
              captured on diskette for computer analysis, enhancement and                    
              interpretation. In this first stage the team will work at a known              
              archaeological site which will then be excavated after                         
              thermographic scanning. Thus ground truth will be obtained.                    
                                                                                             
              This technique is important because it will allow archaeologists               
              both to locate sites more efficiently and to plan excavation in a              
              more effective manner. Location of archaeological sites is                     
              necessary for mitigation work related to highway, pipeline and                 
              other construction.
