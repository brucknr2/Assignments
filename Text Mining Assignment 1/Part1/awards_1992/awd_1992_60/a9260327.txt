Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project                 
              investigates the feasibility of low-cost video linking of rural                
              schools and school districts by means of conversion (now                       
              imaginable because of recent advances in technology) of the                    
              former military technology of troposcatter radio for digital                   
              video transmission over long distances in interactive classroom                
              instruction.  This approach to communications beyond line-of-                  
              sight distances will compete with two-way cable systems and high-              
              speed telephone in the coming years, and the proposed research                 
              will assess its value relative to solutions being explored by                  
              larger industries.  The proposal addresses an important problem                
              of US education:  The future quality of rural education depends                
              on high quality, low cost communications.  Moreover, it                        
              represents a peacetime application for education of a derivative               
              of advanced technology developed for the military.
