Abstract    :
              In many organizations, users of desktop personal computers and                 
              workstations depend on a network for shared access to files                    
              and other resources.  Recent improvements in hardware                          
              technology have made portable computers the fastest growing                    
              segment in personal computing.  However, standard system                       
              software has changed little in response to the new machines.                   
              Network access and stand-alone usage are supported, but there                  
              is no assistance for networked portable machines when they are                 
              disconnected.  This deficiency significantly limits the                        
              productivity enhancement achievable with portable machines.                    
              Research techniques suggest that a much higher level of                        
              disconnected service is possible.                                              
                                                                                             
              This award supports development of new concepts and techniques                 
              for supporting network users when their systems are                            
              disconnected from the network.  Disconnection must be treated                  
              as a normal, desirable mode of operation rather than an error                  
              condition.  For days at a time, disconnected machines should                   
              be able to deliver most of the rich functionality associated                   
              with the network environment.  This includes access to                         
              (pseudo) shared network files and other resources.  Providing                  
              this rich collaborative work capability around the clock,                      
              irrespective of geographic location, could alter the way                       
              individuals approach their work and significantly increase                     
              productivity.  The research will develop and validate the                      
              underlying technology for a system software product for                        
              networked portable computers.
