Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Freshwater aquaculture systems have requirements for improved                  
              instrumentation to monitor water quality.  Closed loop control of              
              water quality will provide additional advantages to this growing               
              worldwide industry.  The objective of the proposed program is to               
              develop systems to monitor and control water quality in                        
              freshwater aquaculture.  These systems will be based on the use                
              of novel fiber optic chemical sensors or optrodes.  This type of               
              sensor is especially well suited to the requirements of                        
              continuous in-situ monitoring of aqueous solutions.  The systems               
              that will be developed under this program promise to increase                  
              aquaculture growth rates, productivity and efficiencies in                     
              environmentally safe facilities.                                               
                                                                                             
              In the Phase I program, the requirements for chemical sensors in               
              freshwater aquaculture will be assessed.  An ammonia optrode will              
              be designed, fabricated, and calibrated in the laboratory.  This               
              sensor will then be evaluated in a recirculating aquasystem.                   
              Concepts for chemical sensors to detect other chemical species or              
              water parameters identified in the requirements assessments will               
              be developed.  Additionally, a concept for a system that will                  
              both monitor and control water quality in freshwater aquaculture               
              systems will be developed.
