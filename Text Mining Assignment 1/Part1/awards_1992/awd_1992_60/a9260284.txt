Abstract    :
              Wide-bandgap semiconductors such as                                            
              beta-silicon carbide (B-SiC) have                                              
              the potential to be useful in the                                              
              fabrication of electronic devices                                              
              that can operate at high                                                       
              temperature and high power levels                                              
              in corrosive environments.  Such                                               
              devices currently under                                                        
              consideration include MESFET,                                                  
              IMPATT diode, and bipolar                                                      
              transistors.  These devices are                                                
              commonly fabricated from silicon or                                            
              gallium arsenide and are used at                                               
              microwave and millimeterwave                                                   
              frequencies.  The results of                                                   
              simulations indicate that B-Sic has                                            
              considerable promise for use in                                                
              microwave-power MESFETs, with an RF                                            
              output power capability greater                                                
              than can be obtained with any of                                               
              the commonly used semiconductors.                                              
              A properly designed and fabricated                                             
              B-Sic MESFET should be capable of                                              
              producing about four times the                                                 
              microwave RF output power                                                      
              capability of a comparable GaAs                                                
              MESFET.  Chemical vapor deposition

              primarily used to date as the                                                  
              method for growth of B-SiC.                                                    
              Neither of these processes,                                                    
              however, lends itself to the                                                   
              economical production of large

              can be obtained.  In this Phase I
