Abstract    :
              The proposed research will use an electrochemical technique to                 
              synthesize composition modulated semiconductor alloys. The                     
              effort is directed toward optimal conditions for the deposition                
              of device quality CuInSe2 films and discrete layered                           
              superlattices from the Cu-In-Se system. This research will                     
              investigate the feasibility of micromodulated electrodeposition                
              to produce homogenous and heterogenous epitaxial films. The                    
              proposed work will involve voltametric screening of                            
              electrolytes, electrosynthesis, and characterization of the                    
              superlattices.
