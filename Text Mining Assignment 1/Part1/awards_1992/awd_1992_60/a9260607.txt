Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              A novel diamond-like carbon coating has been developed that has an             
              extremely low work function.  Using a proprietary deposition                   
              method, this material can be coated on a variety of metal and                  
              ceramic parts.  Phase I of this project will test the applicability            
              of this material for use as a cold field emission source of                    
              electrons to replace hot filaments in electron guns.  The concept              
              will first be tested by obtaining emission from a sharp tungsten               
              tip coating with this carbon material, then replacing the hot                  
              filament cathode in an electron gun, and finally obtaining                     
              preliminary operating parameters (e.g. maximum emission current,               
              emission voltage etc.) for the gun.  This information will then be             
              used to design a direct replacement tip for hot filament electron              
              guns.  Since this material has a very low work function, the                   
              Wehnelt power supply in most electron guns should serve as the                 
              extractor supply.
