Abstract    :
                   There are multiple applications for compact particle                      
              accelerator, especially high energy ?Tens of MeV! and high                     
              current ?KA! output.  Gradients of 10 to 20 MV/m are possible                  
              only with RF accelerators, and existing Linear Induction                       
              Accelerators do not operate at over 1 MV/m.  Tetra Corporation                 
              has developed an insulator technology to suppress and enhance                  
              vacuum surface flashover.  The technology has been                             
              demonstrated to operate up to the gap's vacuum breakdown                       
              strength 40 MV/m at 100 ns long pulses, with the estimated                     
              theoretical limit in the 100's of MV/m range.  This technology                 
              will be developed for use in linear induction accelerators and                 
              dielectric wall induction linacs.  At the present, the                         
              technology has been demonstrated for use as a vacuum                           
              dielectric insulator for gradients of 40 MV/m at pulse length                  
              of 100 to 200 nsec.  There is evidence that at shorter pulses                  
              (10 to 50 nsec or shorter) the breakdown strength will                         
              increase.  The Phase II program will develop a compact                         
              accelerator for two basic commercial opportunities; waste                      
              treatment and reduction, and a source for compact electron                     
              microscopy.  Design is extended to include a better structural                 
              protection and the ability to be driven with a high current                    
              single pulse source or RF.
