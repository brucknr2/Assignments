Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Partial support is provided to assist in travel expenses for                   
              American participants in an international symposium.  The                      
              symposium is:  "Eddy Structure Identification in Free                          
              Turbulent Shear Flows", to be held October 12-14, 1992 in                      
              Poitiers, France.  An additional limited number of                             
              participants, primarily younger researchers, will be able to                   
              participate in this conference devoted to a central issue in                   
              turbulence research:  the identification and tracking of                       
              organized, coherent structures in turbulent flows.                             
                                                                                             
              Advances in the ability to identify and characterize these                     
              structures is an essential element in developing better                        
              predictive methods for turbulent flows, which arise in a wide                  
              range of applications in engineering systems.
