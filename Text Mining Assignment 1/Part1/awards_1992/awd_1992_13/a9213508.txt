Abstract    :
                   Theoretical issues related to the Laser-Interferometer                    
              Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO), most especially studies                 
              of astrophysical sources of gravitational waves, the                           
              characteristics of the waves they emit, and the implications                   
              of those characteristics for (i) the design of LIGO, (ii) the                  
              design of detectors to operate in LIGO, and (iii) the design                   
              of LIGO's data analysis methods will be investigated.                          
              Although all the research is theoretical, the project entails                  
              close interaction with gravity-wave experimenters.
