Abstract    :
              The purpose of this research is to analyze the property rights                 
              system and land use on the Brazilian frontier.  The Brazilian                  
              frontier, especially the Amazon region, has been the focus of                  
              world-wide attention owing to concerns about the rapid                         
              destruction of the rainforest and the loss of soil nutrients when              
              these lands are converted to agriculture.  The Amazon represents               
              the largest remaining tropical rainforest stand in the world, and              
              its loss or severe depletion could have serious effects on global              
              warming and biodiversity.  Further, Brazil is one of the largest               
              and most influential developing countries and it faces many of                 
              the problems endemic in development--rapid population growth and               
              corresponding pressures to raise standards of living, for land                 
              reform, and at the same time for protection of the environment.                
                                                                                             
              This project will entail the assembly and analysis of land tenure              
              policies in Brazil beginning the 1940's.  These policies will                  
              then be compared to land tenure and the expansion of the U.S.                  
              frontier during the 1800's.  The project will construct measures               
              of land tenure uncertainty and analyze these tenure conditions in              
              four Brazilian states from 1940-1980, and six Amazon states from               
              1960-1985 using the Brazilian Agricultural census.  Particular                 
              attention will be paid to the effects of land tenure uncertainty               
              on agricultural investment, the use of fertilizers, the value of               
              permanent structures, and the extent to which permanent crops                  
              were grown.
