Abstract    :
              This equipment grant will be used to purchase a Fourier                        
              Transform Infrared Analyzer (FTIR) which will be used to                       
              support several research projects.  In one project, a jet-                     
              stirred reactor will be used to simulate fuel-rich flame                       
              conditions within incinerators where stable byproducts tend to                 
              be formed; this equipment will be used to identify and measure                 
              such byproducts from the combustion of surrogate waste                         
              compounds.  In a second project, measurements will be made of                  
              hydrocarbon and partially oxidized hydrocarbon (e.g, aldehyde)                 
              species appearing near the lean limit in advanced gas turbine                  
              combustion processes.                                                          
                                                                                             
              While thermal incineration, if done properly, is an attractive                 
              means of destroying hazardous wastes, the potential generation                 
              of toxic byproducts presents a severe limitation on                            
              application of this technology.  Identification of species                     
              appearing under various operating conditions and waste feed                    
              conditions is very important to advancing use of this                          
              technology.  Advanced combustors achieve low NOx emissions by                  
              operating under lean, premixed conditions, where low peak                      
              temperatures strongly reduce thermal NOx formation.  However,                  
              under these conditions, the combustor is operating very near                   
              the lean blowout limit and unburned hydrocarbon emissions can                  
              become very important.  Formaldehyde and other aldehydes, due                  
              to their toxicity, present particular potential problems;                      
              accordingly, it is very important to identify their presence                   
              as a function of various fuel feed and operating parameters.
