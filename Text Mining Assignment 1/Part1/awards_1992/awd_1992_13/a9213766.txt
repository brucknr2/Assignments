Abstract    :
                   The objective of this faculty internship is to develop more               
              useful and efficient containers for the applied research problems              
              associated with the movement of huge volumes of mail across the                
              United States and around the world.  Research activities include               
              container design issues and a wide array of containerization                   
              problems.                                                                      
                   The long-term goal is the development of a family of                      
              compatible containers to handle a wide variety of different types              
              of mail under various environmental conditions.  This research                 
              impacts numerous material handling issues with applicability to                
              distribution and manufacturing operations in general.
