Abstract    :
              This is a research planning grant for women.  During the duration              
              of the research planning grant, several activities will be                     
              completed in preparation for submitting a regular proposal to NSF.             
              Improving the throughput of hardware which requires high                       
              communication bandwidth, and to identify the focus of future                   
              research.  A senior consultant will provide guidance throughout the            
              planning period.  A detailed plan for performing future research               
              in this area will be developed.  This plan, with the background                
              resulting from the other planning activities, will form the core               
              of a proposal to be submitted to NSF.
