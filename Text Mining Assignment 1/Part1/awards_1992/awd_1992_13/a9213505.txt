Abstract    :
                   This grant covers experimental Elementary Particle                        
              Physics research by a group at Stanford University in                          
              collaboration with other NSF and DOE supported scientists.                     
              The group will search for very rare decays of the K-meson.                     
              Previous searches by this group have established the present                   
              world limits on nonconservation of lepton number.  The new                     
              experiment should improve those limits by over a factor of                     
              ten.  Within the Standard Model of quarks and leptons, such                    
              decays are forbidden.  If observed, such decays would open a                   
              window on physics beyond the Standard Model.
