Abstract    :
              The objectives of this research are to determine what factors limit            
              or regulate populations of migratory birds that breed in north                 
              temperate forests and winter in the Neotropics.  the basic                     
              questions concerns whether these factors operate more importantly              
              in summer breeding areas at temperate latitudes, in neotropical                
              winter quarters, or during both seasons.  Through demographic and              
              experimental studies, hypotheses will be tested to determine (1) if            
              limitation occurs in both summer and winter, (2) if habit occupancy            
              is determined by social dominance (depotism) or other preemptive               
              behavior, (3) if individuals vary in fitness among habitats, that              
              is, the demographic consequences of despotic habitat selection, and            
              (4) what ecological variables affect habitat quality and therefore             
              fitness.  Emphasis will be on differential fitness among habitats              
              i both summer and winter, including second-growth forests,                     
              agricultural lands, and other human-modified habitats.  The results            
              will advance our understanding of the population dynamics and                  
              community relations of these migrant bird species, as well as the              
              factors affecting their population abundances.  Such information               
              will also contribute to the development of sound and effective                 
              conservation policies.
