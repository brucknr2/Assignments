Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This awards supports the research of two anthropologists in Wales,             
              studying the underlying psycho-cultural bases of local attributions            
              of Welsh "personhood".  Using techniques of intensive as well as               
              questionnaire interviews, the researcher will gather information               
              about why some sorts of behaviors are deemed properly Welsh and                
              other are not.  Analyzing the data with a statistical model which              
              reveals the underlying consensus between informants of ethnicity,              
              and their distribution across a small sample of informants.                    
                                                                                             
              This research is important because it will add significantly to our            
              understanding of how people attribute ethnicity to their peers.                
              Ethnic identity is a powerful force in the world (witness the                  
              warfare in Yugoslavia at the present time), and increases in our               
              understanding how to deal with ethnic conflict.
