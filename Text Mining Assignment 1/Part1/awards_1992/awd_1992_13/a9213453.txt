Abstract    :
              This project will support the improvement and computerization of the           
              mycological holdings in the Charles Peck collection at the New York            
              State Mycological Herbarium, and is aimed at ensuring  preservation            
              of and greater accessibility to the collection for research and                
              teaching.  This project is an outgrowth of recommendations made by             
              an advisory panel that examined and evaluated the collections in               
              1991.  A complementary project funded by NEH would support the                 
              preservation and indexing of the archival materials associated with            
              the collection.  Specific tasks of the NSF-supported project include           
              the preparation of a database and catalogue of the type specimens              
              with cross-references to archival correspondence and water color               
              illustrations; the latter have never been loaned or published,                 
              and slides of these watercolors will be prepared for dissemination             
              to the mycological research community.  Curatorial improvements                
              involve new housing materials and the preservation of  specimen                
              labels.  The collection of 84,000 fungi is completely documented,              
              contains about 3500 types and 2734 holotypes, and because of Peck's            
              dominant role in American mycology, is of international import and             
              central to mycological taxonomy.  The improvements allowed by this             
              award will enhance the value and use of this collection in                     
              biological research and teaching.
