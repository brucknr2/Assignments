Abstract    :
                   Reverse engineering is the process of estimating the shape of             
              an artifact from position points scanned over the surface of the               
              object.  There are many practical applications that start with a               
              model for a part and need to acquire a representation of a modified            
              version of the part.  Reverse engineering is obtaining the                     
              parameters of the model so that the shape can be related to its                
              functional properties.                                                         
                   This project will develop an experimental system during a                 
              summer internship for reverse engineering a class of parts that can            
              be modeled as graph surfaces, and consist of planar and free-form              
              surface patches with holes.  During the course of this summer                  
              internship, the principal investigator and a graduate student will             
              work at the industrial site to implement algorithms for the tasks              
              that have been identified in this project, and will refine the                 
              ideas through discussions with industrial colleagues.
