Abstract    :
              This award is made as the starter grant increment of Dr.                       
              Richard Gibbs' Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in Chemistry                   
              Award in support of his research at Wayne State University. The                
              research is concerned with chemical reactions modifying ras                    
              proteins, which are present in virtually all eukaryotic cells                  
              and are believed to be critical in signal transduction. The                    
              chemical reactions which Gibbs will study are related to                       
              transformations thought to be essential to ras protein activity                
              in living systems, including farnesylation of a cysteine                       
              function, cleavage of three c-terminal amino acids, and                        
              methylation of a cysteine carboxylate function. An assay system                
              will be developed for the protease involved, the protease will                 
              be characterized, and an enzyme inhibitor will be designed and                 
              synthesized.  The synthesis of a Ras protease inhibitor would                  
              provide a valuable tool for the further study of                               
              post-translational modifications of the ras protein.
