Abstract    :
              Experiences of structural failures                                             
              in past earthquakes have shown that                                            
              shearwalls offer excellent                                                     
              protection for buildings in seismic                                            
              regions.  As compared to the                                                   
              cantilever shearwalls, the framed                                              
              shearwalls have an additional                                                  
              advantage inasmuch as the wall                                                 
              panels can be used as sacrificial                                              
              elements to absorb seismic energy                                              
              and protect the main structural                                                
              frame.                                                                         
                                                                                             
              When a framed shearwall is under                                               
              earthquake action, the wall panels                                             
              inside the frame are subjected to                                              
              shearing action.  Considerable                                                 
              controversy has been raised in the                                             
              past regarding the effectiveness of                                            
              wall panels in developing shear                                                
              ductility.  Recent experimental                                                
              studies in reinforced concrete show                                            
              that shear ductility can indeed be                                             
              obtained in wall panels, if the                                                
              reinforcement are correctly                                                    
              designed.  Additionally, the                                                   
              development of truss model theories                                            
              allows for the prediction of shear                                             
              ductility.  These experimental and                                             
              theoretical advancements have laid                                             
              down the foundation for a                                                      
              scientific treatment of the                                                    
              behavior of framed shearwalls.                                                 
                                                                                             
              This proposal is to study the                                                  
              behavior of framed wall panels                                                 
              subjected to monotonic, cyclic and                                             
              dynamic loading.  The research is                                              
              designed to clarify the interaction                                            
              of the wall panels and the frame                                               
              members, so that the effect of the                                             
              frame constraints on the shear                                                 
              ductility of a wall panel can be                                               
              evaluated.  Based on the static and
