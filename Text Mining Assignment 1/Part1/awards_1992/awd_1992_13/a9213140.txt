Abstract    :
              Although there have been enormous advances in communications over              
              the past several decades,  the vast majority of personal                       
              communications today is still done through wired systems.  However,            
              with the coming of age of personal communications networks (PCN)               
              and digital cellular communication, more and more communications               
              will be wireless, or untethered in the future.   A major                       
              consideration in PCN is the multiple accessing technique, and it               
              appears that spread spectrum code division multiple access (CDMA)              
              is the best choice.  This research deals with the CDMA environment,            
              and a modified design of the standard receiver that results in                 
              enhanced system performance is presented.  The redesign is based               
              around the signal processing technique of transform domain                     
              processing and will result in a receiver which more closely                    
              approximates an optimal detector than does the conventional                    
              correlation receiver.  The research will involve analysis an                   
              numerical simulation.
