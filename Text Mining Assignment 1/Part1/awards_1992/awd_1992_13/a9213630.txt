Abstract    :
                   The focus of the project will be the thermal modeling of                  
              several heat treatment operations.  These modeling programs will               
              be designed for operators on the shop floor to provide a quick, yet            
              reliable, understanding of the actual heat treatment.  These models            
              will provide a better knowledge of the operations, which will                  
              result in the production of better quality products, better cost               
              estimating for bids and more efficient uses of natural gas for heat            
              treatments.                                                                    
                   This project also will allow the Principal Investigator (PI)              
              to become better acquainted with the day-to-day operations of a                
              forging company.  This knowledge will be incorporated into the                 
              courses that the PI teaches and in the subsequent development of               
              several additional projects with the students.
