Abstract    :
              The botanical and ichthyological collections at the University of              
              Alabama are an important national and regional resource for                    
              education and  research in environmental biology.  This support                
              will enable significant and needed enhancement of these                        
              collections and research activities through the provision of a                 
              mobile compactor system for the collections and research                       
              equipment for a new Molecular Systematics Laboratory.  The                     
              collections and the laboratory will be housed in a new 17,000 sq.              
              ft space within a new Scientific Collection Facility (112,000 sq.              
              ft) being built by the University at a cost of $8 million, which               
              will allow centralization of all University, Museum and                        
              Geological Survey collections and associated molecular research.               
              This support will relieve collection crowding, provide for 5                   
              years of collection growth, and considerably expand the                        
              educational and research potential of the new molecular                        
              laboratory.
