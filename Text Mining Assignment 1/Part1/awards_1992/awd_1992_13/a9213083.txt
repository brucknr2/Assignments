Abstract    :
                   The objective of this research equipment grant is to purchase             
              a stereolithography rapid prototyping machine and necessary                    
              accessories.  The equipment will be used for several                           
              research efforts with special emphasis on (1) rapid prototyping                
              directly from a non-uniform rational B-spline based solid modeling             
              systems, and (2) computer-aided design based interactive graphics              
              modification and automatic verification of three dimensional                   
              objects using laser scanning data.                                             
                   The equipment will facilitate the completion of a research                
              program resulting in the development of a testbed that will                    
              demonstrate how to electronically bridge the gap between design and            
              manufacturing for the production of rapid prototypes.
