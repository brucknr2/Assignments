Abstract    :
              This award in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic                  
              Chemistry program supports research on catalysts for silicon                   
              polymerization to be carried out by Dr. Joyce Y. Corey of the                  
              Department of Chemistry, University of Missouri-Saint Louis.                   
              She will develop improved organometallic compounds to promote                  
              coupling of hydrosilanes to form silicon-functional chains,                    
              rings, and polymers.  Combination catalysts of                                 
              dichlorobis(cyclopentadienyl)metal compounds, where the metal                  
              is Zr, Ti, or Hf, with butyl lithium have been used for this                   
              purpose, but control of chain length and structure have not                    
              been achieved.  Corey will vary the structure of the catalyst                  
              as well as the metal used in order to target the synthesis of                  
              specific catenated compounds and, in the process, improve                      
              understanding of the catalytic requirements for                                
              dehydrocoupling.  New types of monomers will also be used in                   
              the dehydrocoupling reactions to form novel oligomers and                      
              polymers.                                                                      
              %%%                                                                            
              Polymers formed from chains of silicon form a variety of                       
              materials which have potentially useful electronic properties.                 
              Some applications in photoconduction, microlithography, and                    
              photoinitiated polymerization of vinyl monomers have been                      
              reported.  Manipulation of the properties of these materials                   
              will require synthetic methods which can control the length of                 
              the polymer chain, its shape, and the attachment of functional                 
              groups.  Dr. Joyce Y. Corey will explore additional synthetic                  
              methods which control some of these factors in the formation of                
              silicon polymers.
