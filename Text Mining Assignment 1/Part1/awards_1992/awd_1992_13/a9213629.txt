Abstract    :
              In this Minority Research Initiation project in the Chemistry                  
              Division, Edwin Carrasquillo M. of the University of Houston                   
              will study quantum state-resolved collision dynamics involving                 
              polyatomic molecules which contain chemically significant                      
              amounts of vibrational energy.  The combination of direct                      
              excitation using a single-photon overtone vibration to prepare                 
              a molecule in a specific quantum state, together with                          
              laser-induced fluorescence as a spectroscopic probe, allows the                
              temporal evolution of a hot molecule to be monitored.  Various                 
              hydrogen-containing molecules, such as HCN, DCN, HCP, and                      
              propynal, will be studied in order to extract relaxation                       
              mechanisms and identify general trends.

              Studies of energy transfer involving very high vibrational                     
              levels are important for understanding many chemical processes,                
              including reactions.  Knowing how the internal energy of a                     
              reactant affects the reaction path or how the excess internal                  
              energy of a product is redistributed as it equilibrates with                   
              its surroundings can help in efforts to control the course of a                
              chemical reaction.  This project aims at examining the behavior                
              of molecules with large but very precisely determined amounts                  
              of energy present in the vibrations of individual chemical                     
              bonds.
