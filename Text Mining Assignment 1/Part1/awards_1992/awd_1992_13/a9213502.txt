Abstract    :
                   This work will pursue basic theoretical research on                       
              atomic and nuclear many-body problems using intensive                          
              computational techniques.  The topics include calculating the                  
              effect of final state interactions on the scattering response                  
              of liquid helium drops with extensions to nuclei and using                     
              Monte Carlo methods to calculate collective excitations of                     
              nuclei and helium drops.  This work will advance the state-of-                 
              the-art in our ability to predict the properties of                            
              complicated many-body systems.
