Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This two-year award supports collaborative research in polar                   
              glaciology between                                                             
              Roger LeB. Hooke of the University of Minnesota and Wibjorn                    
              Karlen of the University of Stockholm.  The investigators will                 
              conduct research on Storglaciaren, a small valley glacier in                   
              northern Sweden.  Their principal objective is to develop a global             
              model for predicting glacier motion from meteorological data.                  
              Dr. Hooke and his team, including an advanced graduate student                 
              and postdoctoral researcher, will spend several months in the                  
              field to work on three interrelated projects with their Swedish                
              counterparts: (1) a water input model for the glacier, (2) studies             
              of the relation between glacier velocity and water pressure, and               
              (3) subglacier till rheology.                                                  
                                                                                             
              Dr. Hooke brings to this collaboration his extensive expertise in              
              glacier dynamics and hydrology.  This is complemented by Dr.                   
              Karlen's work on Holocene climate changes, glacial and deglacial               
              chronology.  Both investigators are very familiar with                         
              Storglaciaren, the field site in Sweden and have been collecting               
              data in this region for several years.  Data from Storglaciaren will           
              contribute to overall global studies on glaciology.  In particular,            
              the study on the rheology of basal till could be applied to other              
              glacial areas including the fast-flowing ice streams of the                    
              Antarctica.  These investigations will also be useful to modelers              
              studying climate change effects on present day ice masses.
