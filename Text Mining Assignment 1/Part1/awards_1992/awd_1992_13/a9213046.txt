Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The PI proposes to purchase a Omnisorp 100 CX sorptometer (an                  
              adsorption) porosimeter) from Coulter.  The instrument                         
              measures the surfaces area, pore volume, and micropore (20 A)                  
              and mesopore (20-500 A) size distribution of a porous solid                    
              sample based on the physical adsorption of N2.  A volumetric                   
              method is used to measure the adsorption and desorption                        
              isotherms over a large pressure range, and from these the pore                 
              characteristics of the material can be calculated.                             
                                                                                             
              The PI, together with collaborators, will use this instrument                  
              in several related studies, including:  (i) Experiments to                     
              obtain date in well-characterized porous materials, and                        
              comparisons of this data with theoretical results using modern                 
              statistical mechanical Monte-Carlo and molecular dynamic                       
              simulations and (ii) characterizations of the porosity of                      
              intercalated composite silicate materials, and high surface                    
              area aluminas, silicas and alumino-silicates.  The molecular                   
              dynamics simulations of the PI are of the highest quality, and                 
              the purchase of this instrument will facilitate the comparison                 
              of the simulations with experiments.  The instrument will                      
              further the research of collaborators working on new layered                   
              and catalyst porous materials.
