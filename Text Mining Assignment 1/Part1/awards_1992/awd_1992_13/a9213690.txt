Abstract    :
              The proposed research will result in an efficient and defensible               
              landfill siting model. A conceptual model of the landfill site                 
              evaluation and ranking process will be developed utilizing expert              
              opinions. Elements of uncertainty in the model will be examined                
              and appropriate techniques to more accurately manipulate                       
              ambiguous data and reduce the uncertainty will be investigated.                
              These techniques include the fuzzy eigenvector method, the fuzzy               
              entropy method, and the Monte Carlo method for processing fuzzy                
              data. A computer program will be created for illustrating the                  
              developed model.
