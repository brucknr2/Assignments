Abstract    :
              This is an award to provide support for a project to study                     
              bioremediation as a process for decontamination of                             
              groundwater. The study is expected to provide guidance for                     
              determining the effectiveness of bioremediation procedures                     
              and to identify any further research needed to evaluate                        
              bioremediation procedures for decontamination of soil and                      
              associated groundwater resources.   This project will be                       
              conducted by a panel of experts appointed by the Water                         
              Science Technology Board.  The panel members will be                           
              selected for their expertise relevant to bioremediation.
