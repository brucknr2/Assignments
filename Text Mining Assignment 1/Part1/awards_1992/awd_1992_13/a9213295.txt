Abstract    :
              The discovery of high temperature oxide superconductivity and the              
              related anomalous properties of the normal phase of these materials            
              has posed a challenging set of problems for the condensed matter               
              theorist.  Called into question are the traditional concepts and               
              methods of band structure and fermi liquid theory, the conventional            
              pairing theory of superconductivity, the fundamental mechanism                 
              leading to superconductivity, etc.  There are two limiting                     
              approaches to these problems; one begins with a delocalized or                 
              itinerant electron description while the other assumes that to zero            
              order the electrons are spacially localized.  While the physically             
              relevant situation remains unclear, it appears likely that an                  
              intermediate situation is realized in nature.  Their program is                
              designed to understand the full range of localized to itinerant                
              behavior, although their emphasis is on the itinerant limit, with              
              many other groups working on the localized limit.
