Abstract    :
                   Research will be concerned with theoretical elementary                    
              particle physics.  From particle accelerators a great deal has                 
              been learned about the fundamental behavior of the quarks that                 
              compose protons even though the quarks have never escaped from                 
              protons.  However, calculations show that at extremely high                    
              temperatures (1010 times room temperature) and extremely high                  
              densities (1015 times normal), protons will melt into a fluid                  
              composed of unconfined quarks.  These conditions occurred in                   
              the very early universe and will be recreated in accelerators                  
              now being built to collide heavy nucleii.  This project is                     
              intended to help develop reliable methods for calculating the                  
              behavior of quarks and gluons under these extreme conditions.                  
              This is important to our efforts to achieve an understanding                   
              of the early universe and of the behavior of nuclear matter at                 
              high temperatures and densities.
