Abstract    :
                   This grant covers experimental Elementary Particle                        
              Physics research by a group at the University of Louisville in                 
              collaboration with other NSF and DOE supported scientists.                     
              The group will complete it's study, at Fermilab, of the                        
              production and decay of vector mesons.  The group will also                    
              participate in a major upgrade of the multiparticle                            
              spectrometer at Brookhaven in order to study mesonic states                    
              with unusual quantum numbers.
