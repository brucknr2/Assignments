Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Mott Community College and Baker College request support from NSF              
              for connection of their campuses to NSFNET.  MERIT is the                      
              midlevel network located in the state of Michigan that will                    
              provide operations and network information services.  It will                  
              give the colleges a 56 thousand bits per second connection to the              
              NSFNET, a high speed (1.5 - 45 million bits per second) National               
              Backbone network.                                                              
                                                                                             
              The colleges needs greater functionality and network speed to be               
              able to access supercomputers, libraries, and make file transfers              
              along with being able to implement a more reliable mail system.                
              Students and faculty research will benefit from the link.  This                
              is also a unique opportunity for the school to explore innovative              
              educational resources.***//
