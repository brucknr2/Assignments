Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Adsorption is under development worldwide as a chemical-                       
              engineering unit operation for the separation and purification                 
              of gaseous and liquid mixtures.  In addition to separation of                  
              air into its components and removal of pollutants from air and                 
              water streams, adsorption is being considered for a host of                    
              new applications, including separation of proteins from                        
              bioreactor product streams, recovery of carbon dioxide from                    
              combustion of fossil fuels, recovery of uranium from sea                       
              water, methane storage, and ultrapurification of water and raw                 
              materials for the electronics industry.                                        
                                                                                             
              Current research using molecular simulation by grand canonical                 
              Monte Carlo and molecular dynamics is providing new insights                   
              into the physics of adsorption.  Results from these                            
              fundamental investigations provide a solid foundation for the                  
              development of new theories to replace the classical                           
              thermodynamic methods.  The objective of this research is to                   
              bridge the gap between adsorption theory and practice by                       
              developing a molecular theory capable of predicting                            
              preferential adsorption from fluid mixtures.                                   
                                                                                             
              Adsorption isotherms of single gases and their binary                          
              mixtures, and isosteric heats of adsorption of single gases,                   
              will be measured.  Experimental data collected for four binary                 
              systems will serve to test theories for predicting mixed-gas                   
              adsorption equilibria from single component isotherms and                      
              heats of adsorption.
