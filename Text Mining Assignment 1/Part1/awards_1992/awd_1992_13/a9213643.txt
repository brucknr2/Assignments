Abstract    :
                   This is a three-year research study of the atmospheric cycles             
              of ozone, reactive nitrogen, and sulfur in the troposphere.  The               
              project will be comprised of three related investigations focussing            
              on specific aspects of the global-tropospheric-chemical system that            
              are presently poorly understood and are of fundamental importance              
              to the regional and/or global environment.  One investigation will             
              focus on understanding the genesis of ozone episodes in rural areas            
              of the southern United States and will make use of the sizeable air            
              quality database that is being gathered by the Southern Oxidants               
              Study.  A second investigation will be aimed at better                         
              understanding the chemistry of sea salt aerosols over the remote               
              marine atmosphere and their effect on the cycle of atmospheric S               
              and the production of climatically important sulfate particles and             
              cloud condensation nuclei.  A third investigation will attempt to              
              elucidate the processes responsible for determining the global                 
              distributions and abundance of reactive N compounds and ozone                  
              through the application a three-dimensional Global Chemical                    
              Transport Model.  This last study will represent a continued                   
              collaborative effort between scientists at the Georgia Institute of            
              Technology and NOAA's Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory.
