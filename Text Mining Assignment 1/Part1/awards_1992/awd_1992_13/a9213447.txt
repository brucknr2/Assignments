Abstract    :
                   This research involves an experimental investigation of the               
              thermodynamics of nanophase materials.  Mechanical attriting is the            
              technique employed to process various nanophase metallic systems.              
              Associated effects of environmental factors during attriting are               
              determined.  Both positive and negative heats of mixing are                    
              represented in the materials' systems proposed.  Grain boundary                
              segregation tendencies are noted and related to the potential for              
              grain growth during low temperature annealing and consolidation.               
              Several experimental characterization methods are proposed to                  
              examine the chemistry on a nanoscale, including calorimetry,                   
              electron energy loss spectrometry (EELS), Mossbauer spectrometry,              
              and small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS).

              Nanostructured materials are a class of new materials whose                    
              properties are expected to be markedly changed by the consequences             
              of the fine structure.  This research explores factors affecting               
              the stability of such materials.
