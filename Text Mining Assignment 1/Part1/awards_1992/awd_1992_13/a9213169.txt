Abstract    :
                   Ecological interactions between individuals in populations                
              are often dependent on the relative sizes of the individuals.                  
              Because of this, interactions within and between size-structured               
                                                                                             
              populations can have complex dynamics.  The dynamics of size-                  
              structured populations will be studied using several species of                
              salamanders that coexist in Appalachian streamside habitats.                   
              These salamanders grow through a wide range of sizes during their              
                                                                                             
              lives, and because all are generalized predators, there is great               
                                                                                             
              potential for competitive, predatory, and other behavioral                     
              interactions between size classes within and among species.                    
              Previous work has shown that some of these interactions between                
              size classes are strong and are likely to be important in                      
              determining community structure.  Field and laboratory                         
              experiments will explore these interactions to determine their                 
              mechanisms.  These experiments will aid in developing models of                
              the dynamics and stability of size-structured populations.
