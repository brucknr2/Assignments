Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  This Minority Career Advancement Award provides funds for a               
              study of the structural conditions of communities that contribute              
              to youth behaviors such as dropping out of high school,                        
              delinquency, and teenage pregnancy.  The study will focus on two               
              cities (Detroit, MI and Phoenix, AR) with high levels of poverty               
              and residential segregation but with distinctive ethnic                        
              composition and socioeconomic environments.  Neighborhood                      
              demographic and organizational variables from the US census                    
              combined with information from local schools, juvenile courts,                 
              and health departments will form the data for the study.                       
                   This study will contribute to our understanding of how                    
              community characteristics may contribute to the reproduction of                
              the underclass.  The Minority Career Advancement Award will also               
              permit the investigator to expand her research in new directions,              
              and it will provide opportunities for several minority doctoral                
              students to participate in the research process.
