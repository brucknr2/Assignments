Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  This award will provide support for research using data from              
              the 1990 Census to be published as a two-volume 1990 Census                    
              Monograph series.  One of these volumes will examine the main                  
              social and economic changes that have occurred in the 1980s, and               
              the other will assess the status of the many diverse groups that               
              make up American society.  Among the major trends covered in                   
              Volume I will be changes in family structure and the rise of                   
              female-headed families, educational attainment and skills levels,              
              employment and the distributions of earnings and income.  Volume               
              II on social diversity will cover gender differences in                        
              education, economic participation and family responsibility,                   
              differences in the well-being of children and the elderly, racial              
              and ethnic differences in educational and economic achievement,                
              and the increasing diversity of the American population brought                
              on by the large wave of immigration that continued in the 1980s.               
                                                                                             
                   The 1990 Census Monographs will provide a wealth of                       
              information about social and economic changes during the 1980s.                
              As its predecessors based on earlier Census data, the 1990 Census              
              Monographs will be extremely useful for teachers, students,                    
              decisionmakers, and researchers.
