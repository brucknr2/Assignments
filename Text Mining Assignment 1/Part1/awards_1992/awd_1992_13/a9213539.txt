Abstract    :
              This collaborative project with the General Motors Research                    
              Laboratory at Warren Michigan focuses on controller synthesis                  
              and development of analytical and numerical tools suitable for                 
              performance evaluation of semi-active vehicle suspensions under                
              a variety of road conditions. Particular emphasis in on the                    
              dynamic interaction between the suspension and the body structure              
              whose compliance is included in the model. Inclusion of body                   
              compliance is considered necessary in view of the high frequency               
              harshness observed in recent studies of suspension systems with                
              on-off dampers, which has potential for exciting body structural               
              resonances and may lead to deterioration in ride comfort. Control              
              laws governing the variation of damping coefficients in semi-active            
              dampers will be obtained using calculus of variations. In this                 
              approach the suspension system can be optimized with respect to a              
              suitable performance index under specified constraints. Simplified             
              control laws  that may still yield acceptable performance but are              
              easier to implement will also be considered. Evaluation of system              
              performance in time and frequency domains will allow prediction of             
              the degree of improvements resulting from application of more                  
              sophisticated control laws and continuously variable dampers prior to          
              building and testing prototypes***//
