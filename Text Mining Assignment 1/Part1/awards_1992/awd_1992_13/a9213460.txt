Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This grant will provide support for the ongoing research                       
              program of Professor Xavier Creary at the University of Notre                  
              Dame.  Kinetics, isotope effects, and product studies will be                  
              used to elucidate the mechanisms of organic reactions and to                   
              characterize reactive intermediates.  Dihalodiazirines will be                 
              studied in order to provide evidence for the formation of a                    
              diaziryl anion intermediate.  The possibility of a concerted                   
              cyclic elimination to give olefinic products under solvolysis                  
              conditions will be explored.  Silyl substituted carbenes will                  
              also be synthesized and the migratory aptitude of silicon                      
              determined.                                                                    
              %%%                                                                            
              The intimate details of several important reactions that                       
              transform carbon containing molecules into new and interesting                 
              molecules will be determined.  Independent synthesis of the                    
              suggested reaction intermediates in these important                            
              transformations will allow unambiguous evidence for their                      
              involvement.  The possibility that the transfer of an electron                 
              will trigger some of these transformations will be examined by                 
              careful analysis of the reaction mixtures.  It is anticipated                  
              that the results of this study will provide the basis for                      
              predicting the outcome of many reactions.
