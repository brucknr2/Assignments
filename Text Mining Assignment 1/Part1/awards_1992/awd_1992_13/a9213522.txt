Abstract    :
                It is proposed to analyze the non-linear response of the Earth's             
              magnetospheric system as driven by the solar wind.   The newly                 
              developed technique of non-linear input/output analysis will                   
              determine the non-linear behavior of the magnetosphere.  Previous              
              linear analyses have been incapable of exploring the non-linear                
              dynamics; previous non-linear analyses have treated the                        
              magnetosphere as an autonomous system, which clearly neglects the              
              major effects of the solar wind.  Under the assumption that the                
              electrojet indices are valid diagnostics of the state and dynamics             
              of the magnetosphere, the time series of the electrojet indices                
              will be analyzed as a function of the solar wind parameters for the            
              years 1978 and 1979.  The identification of low dimensional non-               
              linear dynamics in the magnetospheric system will lead to much                 
              better short term predictions of the solar wind and magnetosphere.             
              conversely, a definite demonstration of the absence of such                    
              deterministic behavior will help to guide future efforts aimed at              
              modelling the magnetosphere.
