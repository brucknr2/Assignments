Abstract    :
              Several compile-time analyses aimed at aiding compiling and                    
              debugging of programs in parallel software development                         
              environments will be developed.  The emphasis is on using our                  
              parallel data flow analysis and approximate pointer-induced                    
              aliasing algorithms to facilitate better transformation of                     
              programs for parallel execution, and further developing the                    
              work in compile-time anomaly detection for explicitly parallel                 
              programs.  The former goal includes both parallelization of                    
              sequential codes and optimization of already parallel codes.                   
              The latter is aimed at the problems of deadlock and race                       
              detection.                                                                     
                                                                                             
              Specific plans are:                                                            
                                                                                             
                 to further profile and optimize the parallel hybrid data                   
                   flow analysis algorithm, especially on interprocedural                    
                   problems;                                                                 
                                                                                             
                 to extend the approach in the approximate pointer alias                    
                   algorithm to accommodate conflict analysis for                            
                   parallelization of  C-like languages;                                     
                                                                                             
                  to explore directed tracing for race detection and                        
                   implement the approach in a prototype; and                                
                                                                                             
                  to profile and extend the static deadlock detection                       
                   algorithm.
