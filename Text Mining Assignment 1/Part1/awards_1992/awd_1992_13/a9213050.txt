Abstract    :
              The new data acquisition systems with support modules will be                  
              purchased to replace outmoded equipment. The new test machinery                
              will be dedicated to support engineering research in :                         
              improvement of mechanical excavators for constructing high level               
              nuclear repository at Yucca Mountain, Nevada; improvement of                   
              surface drilling for site characterization at the Yucca Mountain               
              site; futuristic excavation technologies for hard rock mining;                 
              evaluating the mappability of rock fractures.
