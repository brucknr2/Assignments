Abstract    :
              The Asiatic or Siberian Eskimos were under Russian/Soviet dominance            
              during most of their contact history and subject to enormous                   
              acculturation pressure.  This project will provide the first                   
              monograph on the contact history and survival of this indigenous               
              group and compare Native transitions and government strategies                 
              during two periods in Russia, 1900-1932 and 1933-1990, and parallel            
              developments in the U.S., Canada and Denmark.
