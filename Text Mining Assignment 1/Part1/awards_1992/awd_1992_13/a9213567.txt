Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Chatham College requests support from NSF for connection of its                
              campus network to PREPnet.  PREPnet is the midlevel network located            
              in the state of Pennsylvania.  PREPnet will provide operations                 
              management and information services and it will give Chatham                   
              College connection to the NSFNET, a high speed (1.5 - 45 million               
              bits per second) National Backbone network.                                    
                                                                                             
              The College needs greater functionality and network speed to be                
              able to access supercomputers, libraries, and make file transfers              
              along with being able to implement a more reliable mail system.                
              Students and faculty research will benefit from the link.  This is             
              also a unique opportunity for the school to explore innovative                 
              educational resources.***//
