Abstract    :
              This planning grant will assist in the development of an in-depth              
              study of the influence of law on the role of unions in eliminating             
              "hostile work environment" sexual harassment of unionized working              
              women.  Although it is often thought that the presence of a union              
              facilitates group challenges to environmental sexual harassment,               
              the opposite pattern prevails in many unionized workplaces: sexual             
              harassment claims are typically brought by individual women, with              
              the union either refusing to intervene or representing the                     
              harasser.  This study tests the hypothesis that union practices and            
              attitudes interact with labor law to impede the realization of sex             
              equality in the workplace, undermining the union's image, and                  
              depriving women of a legally sanctioned avenue of collective action            
              and empowerment.  Patterns of union practice relating to legal                 
              issues raised by workplace sexual harassment of unionized women                
              will be analyzed through collection and analysis of reported cases.            
              The issues will be further illuminated through a case study where              
              union women have challenged the hostile work environment without               
              the aid of the union.                                                          
                                                                                             
              This project promises to generate both new understandings and                  
              further studies of considerable value regarding struggles for legal            
              and social equality in the workplace.  As such it will further our             
              knowledge of the use of law in correcting structural disadvantages             
              for female workers in organized workplaces.
