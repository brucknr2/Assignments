Abstract    :
               Efficient algorithms to learn complex concepts from examples  and other kinds
              of information are sought.  A major focus  is on the `other kinds of
              information` that may serve to  reduce the computational difficulty of learning
              complex  concepts, including queries to a teacher, advantageous order  of
              presentation of examples, the presence of related concepts,  graded (as opposed
              to Boolean) inputs and responses, and  constraints imposed by real-world
              situations (e.g., robot  navigation, language learning).  Techniques from
              computational  complexity, the theory of automata and formal languages, the 
              analysis of algorithms, and cryptography are applied to  narrow the gap between
              provable efficiently learnable and  provably not efficiently learnable classes
              of concepts.  The  problem of omissions and errors in the `other kinds of 
              information` are also addressed.  The problem of  approximating a distribution
              by sampling is studied as a  method of extending Valiant's paradigm of
              `probably  approximately correct` identification to problems in which  negative
              examples are absent.
