              This grant serves as an Interagency Transfer to NOAA for joint                 
              support of a conference on Autonomous Bio-optical Ocean Observing              
              Studies.  The conference will be held on April 6-10, 1992 Monterey,            
              CA.  Papers and posters presented at the conference will focus on              
              the latest technological advances in bio-optical sensors and system            
              integration.
