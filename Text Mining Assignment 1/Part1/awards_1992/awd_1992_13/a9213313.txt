Abstract    :
                   Research in theoretical elementary particle physics will                  
              focus on the physics of the heavy "beauty" and "top" quarks,                   
              on the decays of "elementary" particles containing the beauty                  
              quark, and on ways to study the nature of the observed                         
              asymmetry between matter and antimatter.  These are among the                  
              most timely topics in elementary particle physics - work on                    
              them is centrally important to progress in the field.
