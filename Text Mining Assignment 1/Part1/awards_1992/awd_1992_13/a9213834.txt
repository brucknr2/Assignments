Abstract    :
                   This career advancement award supports the research of                    
              Professor Meuser to study the Igusa local zeta function. In                    
              particular she plans to explore connections between the explicit               
              form of the local zeta function and the geometry of the                        
              associated                                                                     
              variety.                                                                       
                   This project falls into the general area of arithmetic                    
              geometry -a subject that blends two of the oldest areas of                     
              mathematics: number theory and geometry.  This combination has                 
              proved extraordinarily fruitful - having recently solved problems              
              that withstood generations.  Among its many consequences are new               
              error correcting codes.  Such codes are essential for both modern              
              computers (hard disks) and compact disks.
