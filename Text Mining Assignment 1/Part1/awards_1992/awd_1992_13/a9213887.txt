Abstract    :
              Partial support is provided by the Special Projects Office to                  
              help cover travel expenses for invited academic speakers and                   
              session chairs in connection with their participation in the                   
              Pedagogical Symposium, "Materials Chemistry-An Emerging                        
              Subdiscipline". This symposium will be presented at the 204th                  
              National Meeting of the American Chemical Society on August                    
              23-28, 1992 in Washington DC. The two and one-half day                         
              symposium will feature recognized experts from industrial,                     
              governmental and academic institutions. The invited speakers                   
              represent a wide range of disciplines and perspectives, as well                
              as different facets of materials chemistry. The objective will                 
              be to educate chemists, materials scientists and policy makers                 
              about materials chemistry: what it is, why it is important, and                
              where it is heading in the context of new science, technology                  
              and education.  In addition to informing the general scientific                
              community about the role of chemistry in the ongoing revolution                
              in materials science and technology, the symposium will serve                  
              to demonstrate the commonality of interest among many chemists                 
              in this area and will help reshape the boundaries among the                    
              various areas of chemistry and between chemistry and materials                 
              science.                                                                       
              %%%                                                                            
              Support of this symposium is wholly consistent with the                        
              educational, scientific and infrastructural goals of the                       
              Materials Synthesis and Processing Initiative. The forum of a                  
              National Meeting will both educate and focus the chemistry                     
              community to the importance and relevance of materials                         
              chemistry.
