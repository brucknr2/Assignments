Abstract    :
              Partial support is requested for the purchase of a                             
              visualization system, consisting of (1) a copper vapor laser                   
              flash combined with a high speed ICCD camera, and (ii) an                      
              infrared imaging system. The equipment will greatly improve                    
              the PI's ability to study the basic mechanisms governing the                   
              interaction between high powered laser beams and solid                         
              materials that are being processed (cutting, drilling,                         
              shaping, welding, joining). A research program studying the                    
              cutting and shaping of ceramics is under current NSF support,                  
              but the program suffers from lack of diagnostic equipment. The                 
                                                                                             
              requested high speed camera will permit detection and                          
              quantification of debris in the plume, measurement of                          
              regression of surface and re-deposition of debris, the onset                   
              and propagation of cracks and formation and collapse of the                    
              keyhole. The infrared system will permit the determination of                  
              temperature maps. Together, the equipment will constitute a                    
              powerful tool for the study of laser-material interaction                      
              processes.
