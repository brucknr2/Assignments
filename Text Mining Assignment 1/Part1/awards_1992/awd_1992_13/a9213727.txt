Abstract    :
              The broad purpose of this work is to understand basic principles               
              and laboratory robot implementations of sensory-motor control and              
              integration.  Such principles could make it possible to build                  
              robots that are more agile and dextrous than existing robots, and              
              they could provide some insight into human and animal behavior.                
              The project will use as a conceptual and experimental testbed, the             
              locomotion of dynamic biped robots that balance themselves actively            
              as they move.  Within this context, the project will explore                   
              actively balanced walking and running, the generation of ballistic             
              maneuvers like those used in gymnastics, task level control, and               
              the mechanical design of legs for good dynamic performance.  The               
              work will involve the analysis of models of legged systems,                    
              development of control systems and mechanical designs, and                     
              experiments on simulations and laboratory robots.
