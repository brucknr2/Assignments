Abstract    :
                   Intensive investigation of the propagation of                             
              electromagnetic waves in Raman active environments using                       
              analytic and numerical techniques are undertaken to treat the                  
              growth of fields due to quantum fluctuations.  Both pump laser                 
              and Stokes pulse evolution are investigated and the atomic                     
              medium is treated realistically.  Approximate, analytic                        
              calculations will be pursued for comparison with the numerical                 
              simulations.
