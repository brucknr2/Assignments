Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This proposal addresses the environmentally important task of                  
                                                                                             
              removing certain hazardous small organic molecules (e.g.                       
              aromatic amines, PCBs and polycyclic aromatics) from water by                  
                                                                                             
              a unique process utilizing enzyme catalysis in an organic                      
              phase.  In this process, the aqueous phase is separated from                   
              in organic phase by a membrane.  The enzyme is dissolved in                    
              the organic phase, and the membrane is selected to have a                      
              cutoff pore size so that the hazardous small organic molecule,                 
                                                                                             
              but not the enzyme, can pass through the membrane.  The                        
              organic molecule diffuses into the organic compartment where                   
              the enzyme polymerizes the organic into a high molecular                       
              weight species which can subsequently by removed from the                      
              organic phase via settling or ultrafiltration.                                 
                                                                                             
              To demonstrate the feasibility of this process, 2 chlorophenol                 
                                                                                             
              (2CP) will be used as the example organic solvent, and the                     
              polymerization will take place in perfluorodecalin with                        
              horseradish peroxidase as the enzyme catalyst.  This catalysis                 
                                                                                             
              requires free radicals which will be provided by hydrogen                      
              peroxide, itself generated by alcohol oxidation catalyzed by                   
              alcohol oxidase.
