Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This project involves exploratory research by an economic                      
              anthropologist from Harvard University studying how tribal                     
              peoples in Nicaragua, Central America exploit non-timber tropical              
              forest products.  The researcher will spend two and a half months              
              in the field locating two different Indian communities which vary              
              substantially in income, wages, and prices but resemble each                   
              other in type of forest setting.  The research will explore how                
              income, wages and prices of non-timber forest products affect how              
              the Indians use the forest by studying time allocation, informant              
              diaries, and surveys of household income and expenses.                         
                                                                                             
              This research is important because the relatively rapid decrease               
              in extant of tropical forests is related to how local people use               
              the forests as well as to how large corporations exploit the                   
              forest resources.  This sort of exploratory research will allow                
              the researchers to develop plans for a more extensive study of                 
              local forest exploitation, which can inform plans for long-term                
              forest use.
