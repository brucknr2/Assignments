Abstract    :
                   This study proposes to collect direct sequence information                
              from the coding portion of the gene for vertebrate serum albumin.              
              Initially DNA (genes) from three frogs will be purified and cloned.            
              Once serum albumin DNA sequences are obtained for these three                  
              species, the sequences will be aligned so that regions of complete             
              similarity can be identified.  If such identical regions can be                
              found, primers will be developed to allow the amplification of                 
              homologous albumin genes from other frogs.  The development of such            
              primers will permit the rapid amplification and sequencing of this             
              major nuclear gene from a large number of frog species.  This                  
              information can be invaluable in assessing the relationships of                
              major groups of organisms which are used extensively in studies of             
              genetics and development.
