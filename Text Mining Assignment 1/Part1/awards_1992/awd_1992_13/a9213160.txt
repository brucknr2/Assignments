Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Models of relaxing derived from studies on skinned fibers and                  
              isolated proteins must ultimately be tested on intact muscle. The              
              aim of this proposal is to measure relationships among events                  
              connected with reciprocal regulation by (i) Ca2+int and (ii) cross-            
              bridges. The fraction of attached bridges lags behind the fall in              
              Ca2+int and relaxation in intact cells. Cross-bridge attachment itself         
              may slow relaxation (Weber and Murray, 1973). Quick length changes             
              cause the appearance of extra Ca2+int in cardiac and barnacle muscle           
              (Ridgeway and Gordon, 1984), but not in vertebrate skeletal muscle             
              (Fuchs and Wang, 1991). Quick length changes will be applied to                
              aequorin-injected frog skeletal muscle to probe the relations among            
              (i) Ca2+int, (ii) rate of relaxation, (iii) stiffness, (iv) filament           
              overlap, and (v) degree of activation (Cecchi et al., 1986) The                
              results will refine the concept that mechanisms underlying g muscle            
              relaxation are perceivably of more than one kind. The physiological            
              importance of dual regulatory mechanisms will be determined  and               
              the relative contribution of Ca2+int and cross-bridges in reciprocal           
              regulation will be defined.
