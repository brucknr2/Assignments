Abstract    :
                This workshop is an NSF-initiated planning workshop to                       
              determine research problems in the area of virtual reality that                
              deserve future funding. "Virtual Reality" is thought by many to                
              be a poor and inaccurate description of an enormously popular                  
              field.  It's various descriptions include a set of capabilities                
              to deliver a tightly coupled, highly interactive, principally 3D               
              visual experience in which the user has the feeling of being                   
              immersed in a 3D computer-generated environment.  Other                        
              descriptions describe a mixture of simulated objects with                      
              customary objects, such as images, from real environments.  Even               
              other descriptions include warping of the perceived visual space               
              and time or emphasize direct manipulation of objects in the                    
              virtual reality or the coordinated experience of two or more                   
              persons in a shared simulation scenario.  The main goals of the                
              workshop are to identify the most important areas of basic                     
              research in virtual reality, to determine the relationship of                  
              NSF-funded basic research to other programs, and to produce a set              
              of recommendations on the infrastructure required for sustained                
              basic research.  The invitational workshop participants represent              
              a balance of researchers in the area of virtual reality including              
              researchers with NSF grants and researchers in government and                  
              industrial laboratories.  The workshop focused on four research                
              areas: perception, human-machine interaction, hardware, and                    
              applications
