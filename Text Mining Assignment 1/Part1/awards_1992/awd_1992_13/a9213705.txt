Abstract    :
              The goal of this research and development project is to                        
              promote the basic understanding of both the instability                        
              behavior and the material failure characters of J-stiffened                    
              composite panels manufactured by newly developed stitching                     
              and resin film infusion technique.                                             
                                                                                             
              In general, analytical solutions cannot be obtained for the large              
              deflections associated with postbuckled structures. In order to                
              predict stiffened panel behavior after initial buckling and the                
              ultimate compressive strength of stiffeners, semiemprical                      
              techniques have to be utilized.                                                
                                                                                             
              Failure of composite stiffened panels due to stiffener/web                     
              separation is a common mode of failure in the postbuckling range.              
              It is extremely difficult to predict this failure, even by using               
              rather sophisticated analysis methods. In addition, due to the                 
              use of advance composite materials, two types of damage propagation            
              must be considered: 1)delaminations in laminates under compressive             
              loading; 2) through-the-thickness cracks in laminate in tension.
