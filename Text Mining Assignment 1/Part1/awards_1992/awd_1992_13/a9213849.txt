Abstract    :
                   This study will investigate the microstructure of human                   
              concepts, with a focus on how concepts expressed by sentences are              
              constructed from lexical meanings plus structural principles.                  
              Building of Jackendoff's framework of Conceptual Semantics plus                
              Pustejovsky's work on event structure and the generative lexicon,              
              the project will investigate a number of interrelated problems                 
              concerning how word meanings are internally structured in the minds            
              of language users:  the linking of characters in an event described            
              by a sentence syntactic positions in the sentence; the internal                
              organization of noun meanings, including properties of form,                   
              function, and origin of objects described by nouns; the factoring              
              of object and event concepts into independent dimensions; and the              
              semantics of rights and obligation.  In addition, the project will             
              investigate "principles of coercion," whose effects are to add to              
              sentences certain elements of meaning that are not overtly                     
              expressed in words.  Such principles are heavily involved in                   
              simplifying apparent ambiguities in words, as well as in                       
              understanding language in context.//
