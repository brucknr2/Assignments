Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              A novel method is being developed for study of sub-threshold                   
              synaptic events that occur within individual neurons in the awake              
              mammalian brain.  Unlike traditional methods which require                     
              impalement and resultant damage to a nerve cell by an intracellular            
              microelectrode, the present method uses an electrode which is                  
              extracellular.  Far less cellular damage results, therefore, and               
              sub-threshold synaptic events can be studied for very long periods             
              of time.  The method entails passing extracellular current pulses              
              through a recording microelectrode and measuring the threshold of              
              the neuron under study to this direct electrical stimulation.                  
                                                                                             
              This research explores the application of this new method to two               
              problem areas in cortical neurophysiology:  (1) the analysis of sub-           
              threshold receptive fields and components of receptive fields in               
              sensory neocortex, and (2) the analysis of sub-threshold synaptic              
              inputs to neurons studied with chronically implanted electrodes over           
              very long periods of time.  This research will contribute to a                 
              better understanding of the cortical neuronal substrates of sensory            
              perception and the dynamic mechanisms by which the properties of               
              individual neurons are modified by experience over long periods of             
              time.
