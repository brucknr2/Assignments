Abstract    :
                   Support is provided for a collaboration between J. Macek and              
              S. Ovchinnikov to examine the connection between the adiabatic                 
              approximation and semiclassical theory.  A short term goal is to               
              exploit the approximate analytic solutions developed by the                    
              Soviets to study high Rydberg states in atoms.  The long range                 
              goal of the work is to establish connections between                           
              semiclassical theory, using Feynman's propagator techniques and                
              the semiclassical solutions of the coupled channel, adiabatic                  
              equations.
