Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Support is provided for the 1992 Gordon Conference, June 15-June               
              19, 1992.  The subject, processing and its effect on microstructure            
              and fracture is critical to the development of advanced materials              
              for structures.  State-of-the-art developments in fracture                     
              processes, micromechanisms of fracture, atomistics of interfaces,              
              nanoscale mechanics, the role of structure in fracture, toughening             
              mechanisms, intermetallic and composite fracture, and smart                    
              materials are included.  Issues of mechanics, materials science,               
              and metallurgy are addressed.

              This study of microstructural development through processing                   
              control is the fundamental building block of materials science.                
              This conference examines the effects of processing on structure and            
              mechanical properties, and has direct relationship to the future               
              use of advanced materials.
