Abstract    :
              The objective of this project is to upgrade the existing Laser                 
              Doppler Velocimetry (LDV) facility at the University of                        
              Cincinnati, in order to improve the quality of the                             
              measurements and extend the area of research.  The LDV system                  
              will support basic research in particulate flow,                               
              turbomachinery aerodynamics and metal erosion.  Advanced                       
              optics, signal processing and data analysis equipment will be                  
              acquired.  The proposed equipment will incorporate modern                      
              burst detection techniques.                                                    
                                                                                             
              The upgrade LDV system will allow for improved research in                     
              coating, turbine design, and coal particle dynamics.
