Abstract    :
              The goal of this project is the full incorporation of a larger                 
              class of swept surfaces for machining, robot motion, and other                 
              applications.  The full incorporation of swept surfaces into                   
              solid models requires concentration on surface intersection                    
              and Boolean operations on solids involving swept surfaces.                     
              The development of a powerful tool for the analysis of swept                   
              surfaces for machining and other applications demands related                  
              work on interference detection, volume, representational                       
              issues, and sweep generation.                                                  
                                                                                             
              One of the fundamental primitives in solid modeling is the                     
              swept surface.  A swept surface is characterized by the type                   
              of sweep (i.e., the way the position and orientation of the                    
              cross-section changes), the cross-section that is being swept,                 
              and the ability of this cross-section to change shape.  The                    
              literature and solid modeling systems are dominated by the                     
              consideration of sweep surfaces generated by translational or                  
              revolute sweeps, and rigid sweeps (the cross-section does not                  
              change shape).  This project will investigate arbitrary                        
              sweeping of nonrigid objects, about which there is less                        
              literature and little algorithmic development.  In order to                    
              make the problem tractable, the study will be restricted to                    
              simple cross-sections.  Thus, the project will concentrate on                  
              the sweeping of lines and circles, although much of the theory                 
              applies to other simple cross-sections as well.  The                           
              superellipse cross-section will also be studied.
