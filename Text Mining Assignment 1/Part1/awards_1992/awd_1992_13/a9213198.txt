Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The objectives of this research are to explore magnetic phase                  
              transitions in novel pure, dilute and mixed magnetic insulators.               
              The study of spin glass behavior in insulating materials are                   
              conducted.  Also, several mixed magnetic systems are studied in                
              which spin glass phases might occur.  In other mixed magnetic                  
              systems tetracritical or other multicritical points in the magnetic            
              phase diagram are investigated.  As an example of a rare magnetic              
              model class, a dilute magnetic system is studied as well.  Variable            
              temperature, variable field magnetization and susceptibility                   
              measurements are conducted on single crystal and polycrystalline               
              samples.  These studies are important because they provide                     
              information on areas such as zero-field splittings, ferromagnetic              
              interactions, and spin class character.
