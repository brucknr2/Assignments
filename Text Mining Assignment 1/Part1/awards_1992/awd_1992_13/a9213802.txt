Abstract    :
                   This grant is for funding of the U.S. Particle                            
              Accelerator School (USPAS) in association with the Applied                     
              Physics Department of Stanford University.  The school will                    
              consist of a program of graduate level credit courses in beam                  
              physics and accelerator technology aimed at education of young                 
              physicists, as well as older physicists in a transition phase                  
              from other areas of specialty, in the methods of accelerator                   
              design.  A great National need for such persons presently                      
              exists.                                                                        
                   These schools have become a very valuable part of the                     
              particle physics scene in our Nation and the World.                            
              Accelerator physics is being taught at only a very few                         
              Universities as well as at some National Laboratories.  The                    
              accelerator school is held in the Summer, and forms a valuable                 
              part of the effort required to educate students in the art of                  
              accelerator design.
