Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The cottonmouth is one of several species of venomous (poisonous)              
              snakes in the United Sates.  Although they use their venom                     
              primarily to obtain food, it also serves as an important                       
              defensive weapon.  Dr. Hayes will investigate how cottonmouths                 
              use their venom when feeding, in particular whether or not they                
              can control the quantities of venom they inject, and whether or                
              not they inject more venom into larger prey.  Perhaps more                     
              important, we need to understand how snakes use their venom when               
              striking defensively.  Because many human snakebite victims are                
              fortunate to have received "dry" bites, with no apparent                       
              injection of venom, it is widely held that snakes attempt to                   
              conserve their venom supplies when biting defensively.  However,               
              experimental data are lacking.  Thus, two experiments will be                  
              conducted to examine how cottonmouths use their venom when                     
              feeding on prey of different sizes and when striking defensively.              
                                                                                             
              From a biological perspective, this study should provide                       
              important insights into how the remarkable feeding and defensive               
              adaptation of venomous snakes have evolved.  It should also shed               
              light on the biological roles and evolution of snake venom.                    
              Defensive bites in particular are of medical significance to                   
              humans.  At present, physicians simply treat the symptoms of                   
              snakebite victims, with no knowledge of how much venom was                     
              injected.  This research may provide important baseline data and               
              techniques for future studies on how much venom snakes inject                  
              when biting humans.
