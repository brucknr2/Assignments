Abstract    :
              The research will investigate the biochemical and molecular                    
              mechanism(s) involved in low temperature acclimation of                        
              ripening tomato which include: (1) cell wall composition and                   
              associated enzymes, and carbohydrate accumulation; (2)                         
              determination of chilling - induced proteins during acclimation                
              in both chilling susceptible and tolerant lines and changes in                 
              the transcriptional activity related to acclimation.                           
              %%%                                                                            
              Chilling injury is a common physiological disorder which occurs                
              upon exposing tropical plants, such as tomato, to low but non-                 
              freezing temperatures.  Fruits exposed to chilling injury have                 
              reduced storage length, as well as quality, due to adverse                     
              alterations in ripening process.  Acclimation to chilling                      
              injury leads to accumulation of new proteins that may be                       
              involved in ethylene biosynthesis, cell wall hydrolysis,                       
              turnover of pectic fragments, and/or accumulation of                           
              carbohydrates which serve as cryoprotectants.  The project will                
              emphasize the early stages of acclimation process and                          
              mechanisms related to chilling tolerance which are not well                    
              characterized.
