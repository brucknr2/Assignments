Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This U.S.-Bulgaria research project between Dr. J. Wayne Rabalais              
              and Dr. S. S. Todorov of the Bulgarian Academy of Sciences will                
              study the mechanism of low energy ion beam deposition (IBD) of                 
              artificially structured materials.  The focus is the fundamental ion-          
              surface interactions, including the influence of substrate structure,          
              defects, diffusion, annihilation, and temperature along with ion               
              energy, type, and charge.  Deposition of two-component films will              
              be studied by using a new, unique, pulsed, dual-beam, mass-                    
              selected ion beam deposition system.  The films will be                        
              characterized in situ by electron spectroscopy and ion scattering              
              and ex situ by XRD, TEM, RBS, and Raman.  The objectives are                   
              to determine the mechanism of ion beam synthesis of epitaxial and              
              ordered structures and new materials with interesting electrical               
              and/or mechanical properties.  The goal is to understand and                   
              control ion beam processes for low temperature synthesis of new                
              multicomponent materials and metastable solids.  This work should              
              lead to an improvement of our fundamental understanding of film                
              growth processes that occur during deposition of hyperthermal                  
              species and the resulting film structure and properties.                       
                                                                                             
              This project in materials science fulfills the program objective of            
              advancing scientific knowledge by enabling leading experts in the              
              United States and Eastern Europe to combine complementary                      
              talents and pool resources in areas of strong mutual interest and              
              competence.
