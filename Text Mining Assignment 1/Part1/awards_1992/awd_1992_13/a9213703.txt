Abstract    :
                   The design and manufacture of aircraft engines are complex.               
              In this project, the concurrent engineering methodology will be                
              used as a team-building tool for the design and manufacture of                 
              some aircraft engine parts by precision investment casting.  The               
              concepts of design and manufacturing are integrated as a total                 
              system involving the concurrent (simultaneous) application of                  
              such state-of-the-art techniques as computer integrated                        
              manufacturing (CIM); total quality control (TQC) using Taguchi                 
              methods and quality function deployment (QDF); and just-in-time                
              (JIT) production techniques.                                                   
                   The design/manufacturing total system concept shows that                  
              cost and quality do not lie at the opposite spectrum of the                    
              production enterprise.  The design and manufacturing operation of              
              aircraft engines, though complex, could be performed at high-                  
              quality and at low-cost using the total system concept derived                 
              from concurrent engineering as a team-building tool.  In this                  
              research project, some major components of an aircraft engine are              
              to be manufactured through the application of the                              
              design/manufacturing total system methodology by precision                     
              investment casting.
