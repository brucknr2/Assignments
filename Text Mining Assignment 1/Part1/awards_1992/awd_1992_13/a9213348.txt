Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Texas A&M currently possesses a General Electric 2  telsa, 31                  
              cm bore MRI system located in the Engineering Imaging                          
              Laboratory. Computer control of the instrument is via a                        
              Nicolet 1280 processor. The PI notes that the processor is a                   
              good, but not optimal system, and that it requires significant                 
              effort for the configuration and execution of special tests.                   
              The PI proposes purchasing a General Electric Omega System                     
              which includes a Sun processor and associated electronics and                  
              software for more efficient instrument control, data                           
              acquisition and data analysis.                                                 
                                                                                             
              The upgraded instrument will be used in several projects, most                 
              of which are concerned with applying MRI technology to the                     
              study of fluids flow in porous media.  Some of these projects                  
              are: (i) Using MRI to identify fluids, their saturation,                       
              wetability and in situ velocity and permeability in porous                     
              media,  (ii) Using MRI to evaluate pore structure,  (iii)                      
              using MRI to study oil displacement by chemically stabilized                   
              displacers such as foam and by polymer solutions.
