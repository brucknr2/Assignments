Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              A fundamental, unresolved problem in olfactory research is the                 
              identification of multicellular pathways involved in coding odors              
              and how ensembles of neurons are activated by specific odors at                
              different levels of the olfactory system.                                      
                                                                                             
              Using a new, novel technique from molecular cell biology, the c-fos            
              gene expression technique is being used as a marker in spiney                  
              lobster olfactory system in conjunction with intracellular                     
              identification.  The question of how pattern discriminations are               
              formed is being addressed at both the receptor cell level and in the           
              central olfactory system as well.  These studies expand the current            
              research technical expertise of this minority neuroscientist, via              
              collaborative efforts, into new and novel methodologies in molecular           
              neurobiology.
