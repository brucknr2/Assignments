Abstract    :
                   This award will provide support for the "First Annual                     
              Computation and Neural Systems Meeting", to be held in San                     
              Francisco, July 26-31, 1992.  The meeting will bring together                  
              experimental and theoretical neurobiologists along with engineers,             
              computer scientists, cognitive scientists, physicists, and                     
              mathematicians interested in understanding how biological neural               
              systems compute.  The meeting will equally emphasize experimental,             
              model-based, and more abstract theoretical approaches to                       
              understanding neurobiological computations.
