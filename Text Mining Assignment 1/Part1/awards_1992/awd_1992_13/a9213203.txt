Abstract    :
              Plankton ecology has made considerable progress towards                        
              understanding seasonal species succession in temperate lakes.  The             
              interaction of predation, competition, and resource quality play a             
              large role in forming predictable, seasonal, changes in species                
              abundance.  However, the potential for genotypes (clones) to                   
              respond to these same ecological factors within plankton species               
              has not been well studied.  Previous research documented a strong              
              pattern of clonal, seasonal, succession in local populations of                
              Daphnia pulcaria.  This succession was strongly associated with                
              seasonal changes in population migratory behaviors, the densities              
              of a strong competitor, and the availability of a refuge from                  
              predation.  The proposed work seeks a mechanistic understanding of             
              clonal succession in D. pulcaria population. Specifically, it will             
              address several questions: 1) How consistently repetitious are                 
              seasonal clonal successions in Daphnia populations?  2) Are there              
              quantitative genetic differences among clones in ecologically                  
              relevant traits such as habitat use?  3) How do predation                      
              (including refuge availability), competition, and resource change              
              affect seasonal clonal succession?  4) finally, how does the                   
              frequency of sexual reproduction affect the observed successional              
              patterns?  The crustaceans under study here are key members of the             
              food chains of lakes.
