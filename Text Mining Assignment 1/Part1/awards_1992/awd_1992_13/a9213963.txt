Abstract    :
              The objectives of this research are to develop new inverse                     
              solution procedures for the identification of stochastic                       
              parameters, and to integrate the developed procedures with                     
              experimental design and reliability analysis for the modeling of               
              groundwater flow and contaminant transport. The experimental                   
              design problem includes the determination of sampling strategies               
              for the purposes of parameter identification and model                         
              prediction. The parameters to be identified include the hydraulic              
              as well as transport parameters embedded in the governing                      
              equations. Model parameters are identified using observations of               
              flow and transport under a transient condition as well as the                  
              available point estimates of hydraulic conductivity. A criterion               
              will be established for the optimization of the experimental                   
              design, such that different sampling strategies can be compared                
              and optimized.
