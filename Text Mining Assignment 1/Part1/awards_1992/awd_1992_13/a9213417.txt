              Technical Narrative:                                                           
                                                                                             
              This proposed workshop, organized by the South Dakota School of                
              Mines and Technology, and Istanbul Technical University, is                    
              scheduled for 09 May 1992 in Istanbul, Turkey.  The workshop                   
              objective is to discuss the future needs and future directions of              
              U.S-Turkey collaborative research on the use of cementitious                   
              materials in concrete.  This workshop will follow the Fourth                   
              CANMET/ACI International Conference on Fly Ash, Silica Fume, Slag,             
              and Natural Pozzolans in Concrete to be held 03-08 May 1992 in                 
              Istanbul.  This proposal supports the travel of approximately eight            
              U.S. engineers who will participate in the workshop and also                   
              present papers at the conference.                                              
                                                                                             
              This workshop to plan future collaborative research activities                 
              involving construction materials fulfills the program objective of             
              advancing scientific knowledge by enabling leading experts in the              
              United States and Turkey to combine complementary talents and pool             
              research resources in areas of strong mutual interest and                      
              competence.
