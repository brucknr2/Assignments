Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The primary objective of the proposed project is to locate study               
              sites at which alternative models for the evolution of primate                 
              social systems may be tested.   One theoretical model postulates               
              that the transformation of one social system to another involves a             
              discrete and predictable sequence of changes in association                    
              patterns among males and females.  According to this model, the                
              transformation from social systems based upon female kin groups to             
              groups of unrelated females, involves an intermediate step in which            
              females do not associate with other females. An alternate model                
              postulates the direct transformation of the typical female-bonded,             
              multi-male groups of savannah baboons into the non-female-bonded,              
              one male units of hamadryas baboons.  In the latter ecological                 
              factors are identified that alter the nature of asociations among              
              females and the nature of relationships among females and males.               
              The investigator ultimately will test divergent predictions derived            
              from these models by studying the relationship between                         
              environmental conditions and social orgnization in two populations             
              of chacma baboons that vary in their habitat and group structure.              
              The investigator will survey sites in Namibia, Botswana and the                
              Republic of South Africa for feasibility and desirability.
