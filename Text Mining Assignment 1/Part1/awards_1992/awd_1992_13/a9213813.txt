Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This award supports a project under the direction of Dr. Thomas                
              DeFanti, U of Illinois at Chicago.  Faculty, staff and graduate                
              students at the National Center for Supercomputing Applications                
              in Champaign-Urbana and the Electronic Visualization Laboratory                
              in Chicago have been actively working with discipline scientists               
              to develope prototype software and user interfaces for doing                   
              remote computational science and visualization.  The High                      
              Performance Computing and Communication Visualization Project                  
              (HPCCV) is a combined exhibit and theater area designed for                    
              demonstrating computing, communications and visualization.  The                
              project is a human resources and technology transfer project, one              
              that transfers computer science methods to the field of                        
              Computational science and one that aims to aggressively drive the              
              acceptance of this methodology by showcasing real applications.                
              HPCCV will demonstrate what it is like for scientists and                      
              engineers to have gigaflop-per-second computing brought to the                 
              desktop on light fiber.  The exhibit will be displayed at                      
              "SIGGRAPH '92 at McCormick Place in Chicago on July 28-30, 1992.               
              High speed networking within the exhibit and to the NSFnet will                
              tie vector and parallel supercomputers all over the nation to the              
              SIGGRAPH 92 exhibits floor.  FDDI, HiPPI and TC technology will                
              be extensively explored and utilized.  The exhibit will also be                
              displayed at Supercomputing 92 in the fall of this year.
