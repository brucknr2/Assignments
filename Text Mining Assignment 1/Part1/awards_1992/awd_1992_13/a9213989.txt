              carry out dissertation research on the nature                                  
              and evolution of sociopolitical complexity                                     
              among precolumbian groups of Pacific Nicaragua.                                
              Ethnohistorical sources suggest that the                                       
              sociopolitical organization of the area                                        
              corresponded to complex chiefdoms, but the                                     
              archaeological data to explain the evolution                                   
              and operation of these politics is lacking.                                    
              The project will provide new data on one of the                                
              most poorly- known areas in Central America                                    
              and, more importantly, it will contribute to                                   
              the ongoing debate on the nature of the                                        
              evolution of complexity in Southeastern                                        
              Mesoamerica and Lower Central America.
