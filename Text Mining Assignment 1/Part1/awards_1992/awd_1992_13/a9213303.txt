Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The primary objective of this research is to establish the                     
              relationship between finger and toe bone structure and the amount              
              of time monkey species spend on the ground and in the trees.                   
              Researchers have predicted that stress on the finger and toe                   
              bones of animals living on the ground ought to be greater than                 
              those spending most of their time in the trees.  To test whether               
              this prediction is correct, the investigator will calculate the                
              strength of toe and finger bone shafts using structural                        
              engineering equations.  The values used in the equations will be               
              obtained from measurements of radiographs of hand and foot bones               
              of ten monkey species.  Captive and free-ranging individuals of                
              each of the monkey species will be filmed walking and running.                 
              The films will be used to determine the hand and foot postures                 
              each species commonly uses when walking on the ground and                      
              branches.  It is thought that the human lineage evolved from                   
              arboreal ancestors and, over several million years, evolved to                 
              spend more and more time on ground.  Results from this study may               
              help in reconstructing the degree of arboreality characteristic                
              of early hominoids.
