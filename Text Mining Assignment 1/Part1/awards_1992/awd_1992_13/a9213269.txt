Abstract    :
              This proposal outlines a three-year plan of research for (1)                   
              taking the final steps toward formulating and applying a path-                 
              integral approach to the collisional kinetics of the transition                
              region between the thermosphere and exosphere, and (2)                         
              constructing geocoronal models with the goal for assessing the                 
              response of the exosphere to, and interaction with, thermospheric              
              variations and magnetospheric processes.  Throughout, the                      
              applications are geared toward observable or measurable                        
              quantities, based on the experience gained during the CHARM                    
              project that is currently winding down.  The specific tasks                    
              making up this proposal are:                                                   
              o    to complete the development of an algorithm for evaluating                
                   the kinetic distribution function of exospheric constituents              
                   in the transition zone between the exosphere and the                      
                   collisionally-dominated thermosphere, and to incorporate                  
                   this into realistic  kinetic models of the hydrogen                       
                   geocorona taking into account elastic collisions of atmomic               
                   H with O and He and charge-exchange collisions with H+ and                
                   O+ using realistic topside ionosphere models,                             
              o    to carry out case studies of the interaction between the                  
                   ring current and geocorona (beginning with quiet-time cases,              
                   using AMPTE-CCE -derived empirical models) to evaluate                    
                   quantitatively the energetic particle flux onto the low- and              
                   mid-latitude thermosphere (and airglow emissions arising                  
                   thereform), and in the case of storm-time ring current                    
                   enhancements, to ascertain whether there is enough energy                 
                   deposited into the thermosphere to affect the geocorona                   
                   globally (i.e. to quantitatively investigated feedbacks),                 
              o    to further develop a radiative transfer code to address non-              
                   isothermal thermospheres and to carry out unified analyses                
                   of Lyman and Balmer datasets collected over the last two                  
                   decades,                                                                  
              o    to compile geocoronal models into a consistent reference                  
                   set, and to use this set to determine values for parameters               
                   defined within a recently-developed analytic modeling scheme              
                   as functions of geophysical and solar indices, thereby                    
                   providing workers in other areas of geospace research with a              
                   convenient representation of the geocorona,                               
              o    and to continue the theoretical development of exospheres                 
                   subject to non-gravitational forces to.
