Abstract    :
                   This grant covers experimental Cosmic Ray physics research                
              by a group at Louisiana State in collaboration with other NSF and              
              DOE supported scientists and foreign scientists.  The group will               
              continue to study the ultra-high energy nucleus-nucleus                        
              interactions in cosmic rays and in accelerator based experiments.              
              They will study the spectrum and composition of cosmic rays of                 
              TeV to PeV energies.  The ratio of heavy to light nuclei in                    
              cosmic rays is a primary indicator of the origin of such                       
              radiation.
