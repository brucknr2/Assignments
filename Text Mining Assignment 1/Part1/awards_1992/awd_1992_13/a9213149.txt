Abstract    :
              The main objective of the research is the development of portable              
              and scalable algorithms for large scale nonlinear optimization on              
              high performance computers.  The research will be guided by areas              
              of applications such as the optimization of manufacturing                      
              systems, the simulation of superconductivity, and parameter                    
              estimation in meteorology and oceanography.  Four classes of                   
              optimization problems will be studied:  (1) large unconstrained                
              problems; (2) large problems with simple bounds on the variables;              
              (3) nonlinearly constrained optimization with a large number of                
              variables and few degrees of freedom; (4) structured nonlinearly               
              constrained problems.  The long-term goal of this project is to                
              fill the demand for high-quality algorithms and software for                   
              large scale optimization.  The research will encompass a                       
              theoretical analysis of new algorithms, as well as the study of                
              computational issues related to their effective implementation on              
              advanced computer architectures.
