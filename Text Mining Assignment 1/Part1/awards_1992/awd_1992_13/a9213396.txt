Abstract    :
                   The intrinsic and extrinsic chaotic dynamics of simple                    
              Coulomb systems is studied using classical transport theory                    
              based on a Langevin equation.  Extensions to include quantum                   
              mechanical effects are planned to delineate the domain of                      
              applicability of the classical description.  Molecular                         
              dynamics using an equation of motion approach is used to                       
              investigate the eigenvalue spectrum of irregular quantum                       
              systems and will be applied to study resonance phenomena.                      
              Finally, a semiclassical and quantum mechanical study of                       
              highly excited resonances in He-like systems will be initiated                 
              to examine the positions and widths of resonances and their                    
              decay modes and branching ratios.
