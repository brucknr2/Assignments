Abstract    :
              This award supports Professor Patricia Thiel, Dr. Luke                         
              Chang and a graduate student from Iowa State University                        
              to collaborate in surface chemistry research with                              
              Professor R. Jrgen Behm and others of the University of                       
              Ulm, Germany.  Both groups are actively pursuing research                      
              on metal film growth and structure.  Together, they have                       
              chosen to study the morphology of a particular metal-on-                       
              metal system, and the mechanisms by which that morphology                      
              is achieved.  Specifically, they will use Scanning                             
              Tunneling microscopy (STM) to elucidate the morphology of                      
              a system composed of Rhodium on Silver (Rh on Ag(100)).                        
              These metals are immiscible and do not appear to form an                       
              alloy, but when combined they exhibit very unusual                             
              behavior by forming a multi-layer sandwich of Ag-Rh-Ag.                        
              The two research groups bring complementary expertise to                       
              this complex study:  the U.S. group contributes expertise                      
              in the particular metal system and the German group                            
              offers experimental facilities and well-established                            
              experience with STM of metals.                                                 
                                                                                             
              Films of solid materials are used in applications which                        
              range from corrosion-resistant coatings to magnetic                            
              recording devices.  The characteristic of a film that is                       
              most important in determining its physical properties and                      
              thus its performance in a given application is its                             
              morphology.  The research proposed in this collaboration                       
              is directed at understanding the factors which control                         
              film morphology, particularly in the complicated case                          
              where there is a mixture of materials involved which may                       
              form an alloy or a sandwich.
