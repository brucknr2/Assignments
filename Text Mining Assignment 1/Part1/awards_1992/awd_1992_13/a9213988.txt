Abstract    :
              This research project, in the Analytical and Surface Chemistry                 
              Program, is designed to investigate the molecular aspects of                   
              friction and wear.  The approach to molecular tribology to be                  
              used in this project includes friction measurements on well                    
              characterized surfaces using pin and v-block apparatus, as well                
              as microbalance studies of lubricant film growth kinetics.  The                
              extreme pressure lubrication behavior of possible lubricant                    
              compounds will be used to develop a model of the mechanism of                  
              lubricant action.  The results will then be related to ultra                   
              high vacuum studies of the molecular surface chemistry of these                
              model lubricant compounds on well characterized surfaces.

              A detailed molecular level understanding of the processes of                   
              friction and wear would be very useful in designing improved                   
              lubricants and wear reducing additives in a variety of                         
              important technological applications.  This research project                   
              will approach this question from a very fundamental point of                   
              view, coupling engineering measurements of friction properties                 
              with detailed analysis of the surface chemistry of the                         
              solid/lubricant system.  The goal of the work is to develop the                
              understanding which will enable the rational design of                         
              lubricant compounds.
