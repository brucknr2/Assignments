Abstract    :
              This project assembles historical measures of soil degradation                 
              and its effects on agricultural productivity in India and China,               
              countries containing 44 percent of the population of all                       
              developing nations.  Now that population growth is near the                    
              fastest rate in all history, how fast is productive land being                 
              lost to erosion, aggradation, salinity, alkalinity, and cities?                
              How fast has the net soil loss really been?  How much has it                   
              cost?  The techniques developed here can become a model for                    
              solving other debates over trends in soil quality.                             
                                                                                             
              Most estimates of soil degradation are erosion estimates.  These               
              estimates suggest enormous losses.  For example, it is estimated               
              that rivers carry 24 billion tons of sediment to the ocean each                
              year, compared with only 9 billion tons before the introduction                
              of agriculture, grazing and other human activities.  But such                  
              studies give gross measures of soil loss, not the net measures                 
              that are closer to the productivity measures needed in order to                
              assess the productivity effects of erosion.  These measures lack               
              information on the earlier amount and quality of soil, for                     
              comparison with water levels.  Instead of a chain of snapshots                 
              over time, we are asked to judge movement from a single snapshot.              
              In contrast, this project assembles and analyzes six main data                 
              sets on soil qualities and agricultural productivity in China                  
              from the 1930s to the 1980s and three main data sets for land                  
              quality in India from 1950 to 1984.  Considerable time is spent                
              on direct comparisons of soil data from cultivated lands within                
              each county in China and India.  The productivity consequences of              
              land attributes will be estimated from these data.  Finally a                  
              range of related hypotheses about land tenure and the role of                  
              specific policies will be rigorously tested.
