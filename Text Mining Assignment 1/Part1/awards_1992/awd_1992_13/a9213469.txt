Abstract    :
              Snyder         The chaotic router for multiprocessor systems avoids  congestion
              in message routing by derouting packets chosen at  random at congested nodes of
              a network.  The routers can thus  adapt to varying message traffic.  In this
              project, the router is  being implemented and its performance is being measured
              within a  testbed that approximates a real multiprocessor.
