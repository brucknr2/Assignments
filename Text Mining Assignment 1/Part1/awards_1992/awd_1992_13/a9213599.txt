Abstract    :
                   This research is concerned with computational research in                 
              algebraic geometry and topology.  The principal investigator will              
              study Newton's method for solving polynomial equations describing              
              arbitrary zero locii, paying particular attention to the case                  
              where the number of equations exceeds the codimension.  He will                
              also study algorithms for producing topological data of a                      
              combinatorial nature from such equations, and the question of                  
              recognizing computationally when two such topological                          
              descriptions agree.  In addition, he will research an extension                
              of the Groebner basis algorithm to the real numbers, for                       
              algebraically manipulating polynomial equations.  Finally, he                  
              will consider the Jacobian Conjecture.                                         
                   This is research in the field of algebraic geometry, one of               
              the oldest parts of modern mathematics, but one which has had a                
              revolutionary flowering in the past quarter-century.  In its                   
              origins, it treated figures that could be defined in the plane by              
              the simplest equations, namely polynomials.  Nowadays, the field               
              makes use of methods not only from algebra, but from analysis and              
              topology, and conversely is finding application in those fields,               
              as well as, in theoretically computer science and robotics.
