Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This research project involves a planning meeting for an                       
              international group of scholars in the field of legal                          
              socialization.  The purpose of the meeting is to develop a research            
              design for a collaborative, transnational data collection project              
              on the subject of the relationship between legal socialization and             
              legal/political change.  The impetus for developing a research                 
              design was a conference on legal socialization held in March, 1991,            
              in Paris, France.  Preliminary discussions about a research design             
              were held at the Law and Society Annual Meeting in Amsterdam, but              
              the schedule did not provide sufficient time to develop a full                 
              fledged research design.  It is still necessary to review and reach            
              agreement on a number of theoretical and methodological issues.                
              This planning meeting will include presentations, intensive                    
              discussion time, and provision for specific drafting tasks.  The               
              project meets all of the objectives of the special competition on              
              "Global Perspectives on Sociolegal Studies."
