Abstract    :
              A high-temperature differential microcalorimeter for the study                 
              of gas adsorption on high-surface-area materials is designed                   
              and constructed.  The system is designed to operate at                         
              temperature up to 625 K, using special materials for this                     
              propose.  For operation below 450 K, the pressure-gauge heads                 
              will be inside the controlled-temperature region, as with                      
              present near-ambient designs; for operation in the "high-                      
              temperature" region (450-625 K), the system can be                            
              reconfigured to place the pressure gauges outside the high-                    
              temperature zone.                                                              
                                                                                             
              The system will be used in combination with catalytic tests to                 
              correlate carbon surface chemistry with the catalytic behavior                 
              of carbon-supported metal catalysts, including iron-containing                 
              bimetallics.  It will also be used in studies of diamond                       
              powder and of nanoparticles of silicon nitride.
