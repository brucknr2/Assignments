Abstract    :
                   It has long been recognized that the exact timing, location               
              and severity of local weather events are determined by what is                 
              termed by meteorologist as mesoscale processes.                                
                   The Principal Investigator's overall objective is to study                
              mesoscale phenomena embedded in larger cyclonic storms to advance              
              knowledge of the structure and origin of such systems and to                   
              evaluate the prediction capabilities of present models.  Specific              
              phenomena to be investigated include frontal substructures,                    
              mesoscale gravity waves and small vortices in polar air masses.                
                   Research will be primarily accomplished through numerical                 
              modeling studies conducted in conjunction with scientists from the             
              National Center for Atmospheric Research.
