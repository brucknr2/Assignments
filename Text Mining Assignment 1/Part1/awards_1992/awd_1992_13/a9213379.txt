Abstract    :
                This proposed investigation examines energy and momentum flow                
              across the magnetopause using in-situ observations of magnetic                 
              field and plasmas obtained by the ISEE 1 and 2 spacecraft and                  
              ground based data from the IGS magnetometer chain.  The average                
              potential drop across the magnetosphere when the interplanetary                
              magnetic field is southward will be measured using both the                    
              magnetic field normal to the magnetopause surface and the flow                 
              velocity along the surface.  By repeated individual measurements               
              across the surface, both the region of reconnected field and the               
              total potential drop can be estimated.  In order to determine the              
              normal component an accurate model of the 3-D shape of the                     
              magnetopause will be derived.  The pressure dependence of this                 
              model will allow us to test if pressure pulses can cause crater                
              FTE's as has been suggested.                                                   
                When the IMF is northward and reconnection is weak, energy                   
              transfer can still take place by wave processes.  We will examine              
              the waves present from Pc 3 to Pc 5 periods to determine if                    
              significant wave energy flux crosses the boundary.  We will examine            
              simultaneous ground based data from the IGS magnetometer chain at              
              2.5s resolution to determine how this wave energy spreads through              
              the magnetosphere.  We will also examine the response of auroral               
              and subauroral zone current systems to dynamic pressure changes.               
              Finally, we will examine each of the boundary layers inside and                
              outside the magnetosphere to determine how each of them depends on             
              solar wind conditions and position on the magnetopause in order to             
              determine what processes are responsible for these boundary layers.            
              In particular we will examine their formation as a function of                 
              solar wind conditions.
