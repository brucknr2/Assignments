Abstract    :
                  The video display capabilities of the Video Processing and                 
              Telecommunications Laboratory will be upgraded using the resources             
              of this award.  The added equipment will provide 24 bits of color              
              and the capability for real time video capture.  This will be used             
              in research involving the transmission of video signals over fiber             
              optic Broadband Integrated Services Digital Networks.  A                       
              codec/packetizer for video data is planned.
