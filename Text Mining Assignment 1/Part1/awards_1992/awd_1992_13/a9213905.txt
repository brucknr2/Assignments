Abstract    :
              This is a collaborative project, with Gregory Caldeira of the                  
              Ohio State University, to investigate the processes through which              
              transnational legal institutions acquire mass political legitimacy             
              and attain compliance with their decisions.  The project focusses              
              on the European Court of Justice, which is emerging as one of the              
              most powerful judicial institutions in the world, and is based on              
              a survey of the mass publics in the twelve nations of the European             
              Community.  The survey constitutes part of the Autumn 1992                     
              Eurobarometer.  Several hypotheses will be tested about the                    
              acquisition of legitimacy by transnational institutions, as well               
              as the consequences of that legitimacy for compliance with both                
              national and international courts.                                             
                                                                                             
              The project is one of the first research efforts investigating                 
              processes of the acquisition and maintenance of the legitimacy of              
              transnational legal institutions.  The analysis will contribute to             
              the development of theories of institutional legitimacy through (1)            
              determining whether the theoretical frameworks are useful beyond               
              the confines of the nation-state;, (2) exploring the connections               
              between legitimacy and compliance, relying heavily on theories of              
              procedural justice; (3) testing a serious of conventional                      
              hypotheses about courts, legitimacy, and compliance for which there            
              are no previous comparative inquiries; (4) providing a benchmark               
              for future research into the processes through which institutions              
              acquire a reservoir of good will; and (5) contributing to the                  
              development of democratic theory by analyzing how courts contribute            
              to and profit from the legitimacy of transnational political and               
              legal institutions.  Overall, the project will contribute to                   
              prominent questions in comparative politics, the workings of legal             
              systems, and in international relations.
