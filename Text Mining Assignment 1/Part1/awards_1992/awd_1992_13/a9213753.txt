              Description: This project provides support for                                 
              the participation of five U.S. scientists in                                   
              the third Karachi Symposium and Workshop on                                    
              protein Structure-Function, planned for January                                
              1993 in Karachi, Pakistan.  The U.S. team will                                 
              be headed by Dr. David Smith, professor of                                     
              medicinal chemistry at Purdue University.  The                                 
              Pakistani organizer is Dr. Zafar H. Zaidi of                                   
              the HEJ Postgraduate Institute of Chemistry at                                 
              the University of Karachi.  The symposium                                      
              speakers include four each from Germany and                                    
              India, three from the United Kingdom, and one                                  
              each from France, Sweden, Australia, Iran and                                  
              China, in addition to five from the U.S. and                                   
              speakers from Pakistan.   The four day                                         
              symposium will be followed by a ten day                                        
              workshop for training graduate students and                                    
              junior scientists on isolation and                                             
              identification of proteins, their compositions                                 
              and their functions.  Proceedings of all                                       
              symposium papers will be published after the                                   
              meetings.                                                                      
                                                                                             
              Scope:  This project supports a significant                                    
              meeting on an important topic in basic science                                 
              that has many direct applications in health and                                
              agriculture.   Previous meetings in this series                                
              had good results in establishing links between                                 
              Pakistani young scientists and U.S. and other                                  
              western scientists, and between scientists of                                  
              the South Asia region especially Pakistan,                                     
              India, and Bangladesh.  The host institute has                                 
              excellent facilities for research in this area                                 
              of analytical biochemistry.  The Karachi area                                  
              is well suited because of the concentration of                                 
              the pharmaceutical and the natural medicines                                   
              industries of Pakistan there.  The project fits                                
              well the guidelines of the Science in                                          
              Developing Countries program.
