Abstract    :
              In order to implement the state                                                
              feedback control laws being                                                    
              produced by many of the advances in                                            
              nonlinear control system design,                                               
              state observes will be necessary.                                              
              This research will seek to develop                                             
              observers for deterministic,                                                   
              discrete-time or sampled-data                                                  
              nonlinear systems.  The main thrust                                            
              will be to extend the work on                                                  
              Newton-like observers in order to                                              
              increase their applicability: an                                               
              improved region of convergence and                                             
              a better understanding of how to                                               
              efficiently perform the                                                        
              computations in a "real-time"                                                  
              setting.  An important goal will be                                            
              to do this in the context of                                                   
              solving an actual engineering                                                  
              problem.  In cooperation with                                                  
              engineers from Ford Motor Co., a                                               
              torque equalization problem has                                                
              been identified.  The initial goal                                             
              will be to design and test an                                                  
              observer on a simulation model, and                                            
              then in an engine dynamometer test                                             
              cell, in order to evaluate the                                                 
              achievable performance of an                                                   
              observer-controller combination.
