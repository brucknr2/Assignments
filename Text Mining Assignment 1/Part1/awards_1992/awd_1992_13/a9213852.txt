Abstract    :
                   Interactions between atmospheric eddy dynamics and other                  
              physical processes (radiation, convection, surface fluxes, etc.)               
              play a significant role in the energy and water cycles that                    
              maintain the extratropical temperature and moisture distributions              
              of the troposphere.  These interactions thus play a significant                
              role in short-term climate variability, but our understanding of               
              how they work is incomplete.                                                   
                   Dr. Branscome and his collaborators will conduct a series of              
              numerical experiments designed to study the evolution of feedbacks             
              in the extratropical atmosphere among transient eddies, moisture,              
              surface fluxes, and radiation through the temperature and moisture             
              distributions which are, in turn, maintained by the eddies.  The               
              time scales under consideration are periods of several days to                 
              several months.  With this study, the PIs are building on their                
              series of results from studies of the interactions between                     
              baroclinic eddies.  Under the last grant, they looked at the effect            
              of moisture.  With this award, they will explore the radiative                 
              effect.  This research is an important part of current efforts to              
              better understand, and eventually predict, short-term climate.                 
                   This grant consists of two awards which are being made to                 
              separate institutions for a collaborative effort.  The other award             
              is ATM-9123552 to Dr. Gutowski of Iowa State University.
