Abstract    :
              It is proposed to develop on apparatus for characterization of                 
              compressible filter cakes, and to perform a comprehensive                      
              research program on it.  Professor G. Chase and a graduate                     
              student of the University of Akron will spend two months at                    
              Eastman Chemical laboratory to set up the experimental                         
              facility in collaboration with J. Kanel of Eastman Chemical                    
              Co.  Experiments will be run in parallel at the Eastman                        
              Chemical Co. and at the University of Akron, where a second                    
              apparatus will be assembled for the undergraduate laboratory.                  
              It is expected that this project will provide useful                           
              scientific and applied results, as well as the basis for a                     
              long-term relationship between the respective university and                   
              industry.  The main output from the proposed apparatus will be                 
              results on the cake resistance and local cake porosity, which                  
              can be used as reference for model development, and testing                    
              data in industry.  The involvement of graduate and                             
              undergraduate students will be another benefit of this                         
              collaboration.                                                                 
                                                                                             
              The proposed project will accomplish well the goals of the                     
              "Engineering Faculty Internships Initiative".  Matching funds                  
              are provide by Eastman Chemical Co. ($16,947) and the                          
              University of Akron ($3,800).
