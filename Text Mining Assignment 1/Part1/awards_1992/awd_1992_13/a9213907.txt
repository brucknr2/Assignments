Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              A new method for the generation of inorganic:  organic composites              
              for Photonics using Laser Assisted Molecular Beam Epitaxy (LAMBE)              
              will be developed.  Photonics, which involves the use of photons to            
              acquire, process, store and transmit information, is emerging as a             
              new multidisciplinary frontier of science and technology.  These               
              proposed novel composite photonic materials will combine the high              
              optical quality and environmental stability of inorganic oxides                
              with the large nonlinear optical coefficients of organic                       
              structures.  The new technique of generating these composites is               
              highly unique in that it involves a low temperature processing more            
              suitable for sensitive organic materials.  It involves direct                  
              injection of an organic vapor into a molecular beam expansion of               
              the inorganic oxide produced by typical laser ablation.  The mixed             
              system is subsequently deposited on the desired substrate.  Films              
              of optical waveguiding quality will be produced using the proposed             
              technique of laser assisted molecular beam epitaxy, and the linear             
              and nonlinear optical properties of these films will be                        
              characterized.
