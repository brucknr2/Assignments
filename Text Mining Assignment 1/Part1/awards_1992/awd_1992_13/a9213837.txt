Abstract    :
                   In order to evaluate the ultimate usefulness of the Earth                 
              as a gravitational wave detector Professor Boughn will compute                 
              the excitation of the quadrupole modes of the Earth by                         
              terrestrial mechanisms, the most important of which are                        
              earthquakes and atmospheric/ocean pressure loading.  This                      
              research will primarily involve careful modeling of the latter                 
              mechanism and then comparing the results with seismic data                     
              taken in earthquake quiet times.  The results of this analysis                 
              will not only provide an evaluation of the ultimate                            
              sensitivity of the Earth to gravitational waves but should                     
              also provide interesting geophysical information about                         
              excitation mechanisms of the modes of vibration of the Earth.
