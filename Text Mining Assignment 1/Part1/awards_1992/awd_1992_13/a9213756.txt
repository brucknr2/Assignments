Abstract    :
                   This grant covers experimental Elementary Particle                        
              Physics research by a group at the Illinois Institute of                       
              Technology in collaboration with other NSF and DOE supported                   
              scientists.  The group will study, at Fermilab, the production                 
              and decay of hadrons containing heavy quarks.  The detailed                    
              properties of the charmed quark decays established by these                    
              measurements constrain the fundamental parameters in the                       
              Standard Model of interacting quarks and leptons.
