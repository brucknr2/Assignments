Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Over a three year period, Dr. Curt Beck will continue his                      
              analysis of organic artifacts recovered in European Paleolithic                
              and Neolithic archaeological sites.  The research is designed not              
              only to increase understanding of European  prehistory -                       
              especially patterns of trade - but also to involve Vassar                      
              undergraduates in scientific research.  Dr. Beck will focus on                 
              three areas:  1.  the provenience analysis of archaeological                   
              artifacts of amber and related fossil resins in European                       
              prehistory, principally by infrared spectroscopy; 2.  the                      
              analysis and identification of non-fossil resinous and fatty                   
              residues and coatings in archaeological ceramics, principally by               
              gas chromatography/mass spectrometry; 3.  the application of                   
              computers to spectra classification, data management and                       
              simulation of mathematical models of prehistoric exchange                      
              systems.  The research is important because it will increase                   
              understanding of how complex societies developed,  It will also                
              encourage undergraduates to pursue careers in science.
