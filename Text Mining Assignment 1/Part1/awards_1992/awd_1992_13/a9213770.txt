Abstract    :
                   This award is a to develop an intelligent gear inspection                 
              system to measure the dimensions of manufactured gears, quickly and            
              precisely using non-contact measurement sensors.  This gear                    
              inspection system, which is being developed in close collaboration             
              with an industrial co-sponsor, will utilize laser vibrometers and              
              proximity probes to measure the gear parameters in an extremely                
              rapid fashion in comparison to conventional gear checkers.  The                
              development of software to evaluate the gear will also be an                   
              integral part of the project.                                                  
                   This award which will enable an academic to work in close                 
              cooperation with an industrial co-sponsor, while tackling a serious            
              manufacturing problem, will be of considerable benefit to both                 
              parties involved.  Increased awareness of the problems associated              
              with gear manufacturing in the university environment will be an               
              additional benefit.
