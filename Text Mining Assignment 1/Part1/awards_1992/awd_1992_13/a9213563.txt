Abstract    :
              Civil Engineering structures are subjected to short duration                   
              dynamic loads due to vehicle impact, ice impact on bridge piers and            
              off shore oil platforms, debris impact during storms or                        
              earthquakes, pounding during earthquakes, projectile impact from               
              failed rotating machinery, accidental or intentional explosions,               
              and many other sources.  The present equipment request is aimed at             
              augmenting a unique large scale outdoor pendulum test facility                 
              dedicated to studies on the response of structures to short-                   
              duration dynamic loads.  The existing facility was completed in                
              1989, and is capable of testing full-scale structures.  However,               
              this facility does not have an appropriate data acquisition system             
              and its use is significantly curtailed by weather conditions.  The             
              requested equipment will enable the researchers to develop a                   
              smaller indoor testing facility for precise parallel studies on                
              small-scale models of the prototypes tested in the outdoor                     
              facility.  furthermore, the advanced data acquisition system could             
              be employed also for large scale tests.  The combination of                    
              accurate full-scale and reduced-scale experimental studies will                
              enable the researchers to develop scaling and loading realm of                 
              structural behavior.  Fundamental  treatment of material and                   
              structural response under short duration dynamic effects would be              
              combined for precisely defining resistance mechanisms and their                
              contributions to observed structural behavior. ***
