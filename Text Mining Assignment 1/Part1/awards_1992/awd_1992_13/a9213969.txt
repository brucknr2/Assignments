Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The Sondrestrom incoherent scatter radar in Greenland has recently             
              been upgraded with a new radar data acquisition system that allows             
              measurements to be made with a higher spatial resolution than ever             
              before.  The effort proposed here will take advantage of the                   
              improvements to study two interesting and important problems in                
              ionospheric physics.  The first is the appearance of thin layers of            
              metallic ions at altitudes near 110 km.  These layers have been                
              observed at lower latitudes and have been explained as the                     
              concentration of meteoric material due to shears in the neutral                
              winds.  At high latitudes this explanation does not apply, so that             
              the appearance of these layers in the Sondrestrom data is an                   
              important breakthrough.  The second topic of the proposed study is             
              the enhanced ionization at altitudes below 100 km that occurs at               
              high latitudes during large magnetic storms.  This ionization is               
              produced by energetic protons from the sun and its presence at such            
              low altitudes can produce dramatic changes in radiowave propagation            
              at high latitudes.
