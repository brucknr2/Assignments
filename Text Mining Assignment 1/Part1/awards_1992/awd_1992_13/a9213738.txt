Abstract    :
                   This project will carry out theoretical calculations of                   
              intermediate energy electroweak processes in light nuclei with                 
              the aim of obtaining new information on the symmetry                           
              properties of nucleon-nucleon interactions.  Parity violating                  
              asymmetry in polarized electron-deutron scattering will be                     
              studied and also neutrino-deutron scattering will be                           
              investigated.  Further work will be done on photo and electro-                 
              reactions on helium inspired by recent experimental                            
              measurements.
