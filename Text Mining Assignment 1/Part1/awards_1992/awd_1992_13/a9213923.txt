Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Bank Street College requests support from NSF for connection of                
              its campus network to NYSERnet.  NYSERnet is the midlevel network              
              located in the state of New York.  NYSERnet will provide                       
              operations management and information services and it will                     
              provide Bank Street College with a 19.2 thousand bits per second               
              connection to the NSFNET, a high speed (1.5 - 45 million bits per              
              second) National Backbone network.                                             
                                                                                             
              The College needs greater functionality and network speed to be                
              able to access supercomputers, libraries, and make file transfers              
              along with being able to implement a more reliable mail system.                
              Students and faculty research will benefit from the link.  This                
              is also a unique opportunity for the school to explore innovative              
              educational resources.***//
