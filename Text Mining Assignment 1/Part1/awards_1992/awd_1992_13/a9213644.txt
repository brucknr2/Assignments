Abstract    :
                   Joints play an important role in analysis and design of                   
              automotive structures.  The objective of this faculty internship               
              is to develop a physical, design oriented joint model that                     
              estimates the static performance of a joint in terms of physical               
              design parameters, such as dimensions, and pitch of spot welds.                
              The key idea is to develop and use a simple finite element joint               
              model consisting of intersecting box-shaped beams that accounts for            
              all the important deformation mechanisms in a joint.  The theory               
              of thin-walled structures and regress on results obtained by finite            
              element analysis of joint models in order to derive a set of simple            
              equations relating the dimensions of a joint and other physical                
              design parameters with the behavior of the joint will be used.                 
                   The study will provide designers of automotive structures with            
              a useful tool for preliminary design of new car models.  This                  
              design tool will allow them to apply structural optimization to                
              improve the design of a joint and also of the overall car                      
              structure.
