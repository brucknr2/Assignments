Abstract    :
              This project supports a conference which focuses on techniques to              
              analyze problems associated with air and structure borne sound and             
              vibration. The techniques include sound intensity, structural                  
              intensity, modal analysis and synthesis, statistical energy                    
              analysis, passive and active damping, boundary element methods,                
              diagnostics and condition monitoring; material characterization,               
              and non-destructive evaluation, active noise and vibration control,            
              sound radiation and scattering, and finite element analysis. The               
              techniques have numerous applications in aircraft, spacecraft,                 
              buildings, and other structures***//
