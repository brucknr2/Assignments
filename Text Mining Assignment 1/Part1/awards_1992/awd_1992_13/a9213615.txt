Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                   For the past six years this research team has been testing               
              a model for estimating the size of uncontrollable populations                  
              (populations like victims of rape, or people who are HIV-sero-                 
              positive, or homeless people).  The model has shown promise but                
              has also shown some clear shortcomings, as a result of having                  
              almost no theory regarding the rules governing social networks -               
              that is, the rules governing who people know and what they know                
              about one another.  The investigator's program of research will                
              a) illuminate those rules and b) improve model for estimating the              
              size of uncountable populations.  Two studies are planned.  The                
              first study addresses the question:  How difficult is it to know               
              various things about other people?  Given, for example, that it                
              is easier to know the occupation of those identified in a network              
              than it is to know their blood type, how can this difference be                
              measured, and what conditions of "knowing" one another does this               
              difficulty depend on?  The second study addresses the question:                
              How many people do we know well enough to know their occupation                
              or blood type - or a host of other kinds of information?  The                  
              importance of the topic area is very great, both for fundamental               
              research and for applied and policy purposes.
