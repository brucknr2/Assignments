Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                                                                                             
                  This Research in Undergraduate Institutions award (RUI)                   
              provides support for a study of three major ideological movements              
              in the contemporary Middle East.  The first is Islamic modernism,              
              which became the dominant political tendency within Islam in the               
              late nineteenth and early twentieth century.  The second is the                
              ebb of Islam and the rise of various secular ideologies such as                
              nationalism and liberalism in the early to mid-twentieth century.              
              The third is the rise of fundamentalist Islam as the dominant                  
              tendency within the opposition movements largely in the sixties                
              and thereafter.  The study will use archival materials for Egypt,              
              Iran, India, Pakistan and Syria to examine the causes of the rise              
              of these ideological movements, and to examine the connection                  
              between macro socioeconomic and political changes and the rise or              
              decline in ideological movements in the Middle East.                           
                   This study will provide a scientific understanding of                     
              Islamic and other movements in the Middle Eastern countries, and               
              by doing so it may overcome some of the misconceptions that                    
              exists in Western cultures on the nature of contemporary Middle                
              Eastern societies and the nature of Islamic movements in general.
