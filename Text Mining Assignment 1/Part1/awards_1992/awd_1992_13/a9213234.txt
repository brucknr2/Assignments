Abstract    :
                  9213234  Colgate      This is the second year funding of a three year
              continuing award.   This project investigates a hypothesis related to the use
              of hand  tools, with particular emphasis on the application of any  discovered
              design principles to bilateral micromanipulators such as  those used in
              microsurgery, with the hope that these principles  would accelerate the
              evolutionary design and development of these  and other tools.  The hypothesis
              to be tested is that the hand tool  which optimizes performance of a given task
              is that which optimizes  the average power output from the operator, excepting
              power that is  dissipated in the tool.  Underlying this hypothesis is the
              notion  that a well-designed hand tool serves to effect an impedance match 
              between the human and the environment, enabling quick and efficient  energy
              transfer.  While this hypothesis does not deny the  importance of information
              processing, it avoids using a measure of  information transmission, which can
              be difficult to establish in  the unstructured tasks of typical tool use.  The
              study is performed  with a "virtual tool system" consisting of a real time 
              tool/environment simulation which outputs forces to a graphics  display.  A
              novel computer architecture for simulation is used to  achieve real time rates.
