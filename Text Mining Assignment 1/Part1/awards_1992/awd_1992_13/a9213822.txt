Abstract    :
                  9213822  Defanti         This is the third year funding of a three year
              continuation award.   Virtual reality includes 3D display of views which track
              the user's  perspective viewpoint in real time.  Two major existing modes are 
              head-mounted displays (HMD) and boom-mounted displays.  This work  is on an
              alternative environment:  a room ("CAVE") constructed from  7'x7' screens on
              which graphics are projected.  This work will add  engineering enhancements to
              improve the performance and sonic  feedback of this room.  Quantitative
              assessment of the benefits of  this type of display for a number of tasks will
              be done.   Collaborative effort will take place with discipline scientists 
              working on grand challenge problems in computational science.
