                  9213775 Jain This grant is to investigate MQW SLMs utilizing
              heterostructure acoustic charge transport (HACT), enhanced birefringence, and
              Bragg diffraction based SLMs.  The emphasis will be on their relative
              suitability to the industrial production environment.  In the case of HACT
              SLMs, the project involves the merger of HACT technology, developed at United
              Technologies Research Center (UTRC) for micorelectronics signal processing
              applications, with the novel MQW SLM designs conceived at the University of
              Connecticut.  The demonstration of technical feasibility will be followed by
              the production of proposed devices by industries in Connecticut.
