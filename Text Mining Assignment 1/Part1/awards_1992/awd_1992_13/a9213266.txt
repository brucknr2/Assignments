Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This research involves the study of rare and threatened aggregations           
              of species is the butterfly genus Anetia from high altitude habitats           
              on Hispaniola, Jamaica, Cuba, and MesoAmerica.  Anetia is probably             
              the most primitive genus of Monarch butterflies, which makes its               
              behavior, physiology, and reproductive and population dynamics                 
              central to understanding the biology of aggregation, mimicry,                  
              diapause and chemical defense in butterflies.  One of the expected             
              results of this study is a better understanding of the origin and              
              nature of chemical defenses in insects: are the noxious chemicals              
              independent synthesized by the insects or do they sequester the                
              chemicals from food plants?  The project is extremely urgent, given            
              the imminent disappearance of the high, montane forests in the                 
              Lesser Antilles.
