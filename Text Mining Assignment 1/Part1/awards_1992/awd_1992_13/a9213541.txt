Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  This Engineering Faculty Internships (EFI) project supports               
              the collaboration of Professor Richard E. Riman with scientists at             
              EniChem on the preparation and study of silicon carbide passivation            
              layers.  Methodologies for characterization of the silicon carbide             
              layers and the modified layers after exposure to chemical                      
              processing environments will be developed.  Additional work will               
              focus on the establishment of surface chemistry models that                    
              describe major reactions.                                                      
                                                                                             
                   The EFI program enriches the background of college faculty to             
              make them more effective teachers and encourages them to contribute            
              their expertise to the aid of industry.  Corrosion shortens the                
              functional lifetime of much industrial equipment and increases                 
              costs to society.  Protective coatings like silicon carbide might              
              mitigate substantially the deleterious effects of corrosion.
