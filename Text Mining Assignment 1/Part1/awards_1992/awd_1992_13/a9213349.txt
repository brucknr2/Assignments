Abstract    :
                   This grant to the University of Pittsburgh supports                       
              research and graduate education using the CERN Super Proton                    
              Synchrotron in Geneva, Switzerland, to study very high energy                  
              proton and heavy ion interactions with nuclei.  The experiment                 
              will use a specialized magnetic spectrometer to measure the                    
              source size of the "fireball" produced in the nuclear reactions                
              through the identification of correlated pions and kaons which                 
              are ejectiles in the reactions.
