Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Kin recognition is a fundamental mechanism in animal behavior.                 
              Many animal species, including humans, are able to discriminate                
              between close relatives and other individuals of the same                      
              species, and to behave preferentially to close relatives.  Often,              
              the signals used by animals to make these discriminations are                  
              odors, but only in the honey bee have specific chemical compounds              
              been identified that enable animals to tell relatives from non-                
              relatives.  This project will provide new information on how                   
              these odors are used by honey bees, will identify additional such              
              odors, and will enhance our understanding of how the production                
              of odors is inherited.  In a practical sense, the project will                 
              suggest new ways to manipulate honey bee colonies so that                      
              beekeeping practices may be improved.  The results may prove to                
              be particularly important in suggesting ways of preventing the                 
              African honey bee from disrupting beekeeping operations.
