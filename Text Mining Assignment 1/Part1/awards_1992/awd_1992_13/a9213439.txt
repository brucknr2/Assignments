Abstract    :
                   The concrete complexity behavior of some NP-hard discrete                 
              optimization problems will be investigated, with instances                     
              restricted to graphs having tree-representable structure (for                  
              instance, k-trees, series-parallel graphs, or interval                         
              graphs.)   A major tool in this research is the concept of                     
              treewidth of graphs.  Families of graphs with bounded                          
              treewidth admit a special type of non-serial dynamic                           
              programming approach leading to algorithms efficiently solving                 
              many difficult discrete optimization problems.                                 
                   The work of Robertson and Seymour on well-quasi orderings                 
              of graphs implies existence of low-order polynomial time                       
              solution algorithms for many inherently difficult optimization                 
              problems, when instances are restricted to wide classes of                     
              graphs.  However, such algorithms suffer a double weakness:                    
              they require knowledge of a finite obstruction set, and the                    
              general design paradigm constructs algorithms that execute in                  
              polynomial time but with multiplicative constants of                           
              astronomic magnitude.                                                          
                   The proposed research will deal with these deficiencies                   
              in two ways:  investigating means to construct obstruction                     
              sets for families of graphs with uniformly bounded treewidth                   
              and streamlining solution algorithms for particular discrete                   
              optimization problems, as the full generality of the algorithm                 
              design paradigm often is not necessary.
