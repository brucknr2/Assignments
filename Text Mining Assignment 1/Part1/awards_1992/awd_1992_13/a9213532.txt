Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The primary objective of this proposal is to investigate the                   
              potential for establishing primate research sites in the vicinity              
              of Georgetown, Guyana.  Guyana is a promising country for long-term            
              primate research as the forests are still relatively unaffected by             
              human activity and the government is amenable to their protection.             
              Additionally eight species of New World monkey are found in the                
              country.  The researchers will conduct a survey of two regions in              
              order to determine the number of species present, their densities              
              and distribution.  If either of the regions is appropriate for long            
              term research, the investigators will undertake to carry out an                
              extensive study of the synecology of the the primates.
