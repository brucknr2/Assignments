Abstract    :
              This Minority Research Initiation Career Advancement Award is to               
              support theoretical and computational research to expand the                   
              capabilities of Howard University's program on electronic structure            
              theory.  Resources will be used to expand the present program by               
              modifying existing computer codes to include studies of                        
              artificially structured materials in reduced dimensions such as                
              quantum wells, semiconductor superlattices, quantum dots and                   
              quantum wires.
