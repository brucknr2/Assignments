Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Experimental research will be carried out on flow-induced                      
              orientation of liquid crystals in liquid crystalline polymeric                 
              materials. Birefringence and velocimetry will be used to study                 
              orientation details and their kinematics in a sequence of                      
              increasingly complex nonhomogeneous flows. A newly developed                   
              spectrographic birefringence technique is available for this                   
              purpose.                                                                       
                                                                                             
              Liquid crystal materials are utilized in a variety of                          
              engineering systems, and their characterization under dynamic                  
              conditions is presently still only poorly understood.
