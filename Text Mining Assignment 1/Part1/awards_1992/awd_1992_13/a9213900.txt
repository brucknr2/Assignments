Abstract    :
                   Research to understand the basic dynamics of high energy                  
              positron collisions with hydrogen-like ions is undertaken in                   
              response to recent experimental measurements which reveal that                 
              even this simple three-body Coulomb system is not understood.                  
              The methods to be employed are centered about the impulse                      
              approximation, already used in ion-atom collisions, and a new                  
              time-dependent approach based on the Schwinger variational                     
              principle.
