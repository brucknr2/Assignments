Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This research project has two central objectives.  The first is to             
              observe, measure, and summarize the degree of change and continuity            
              of a number of the key attributes of the global political system               
              from the Congress of Vienna (1816) to the present day.  The second             
              is to ascertain the extent to which the postulated mix of change               
              and continuity is associated with fluctuations in the incidence of             
              international war.  More specifically, is war more frequent or                 
              severe prior to, during, or after periods of appreciable system                
              change?  There are several schools of thought, none solidly                    
              substantiated by the evidence, but on the basis of some tentative              
              findings, historical recall, and deductive reasoning, the working              
              hypothesis in this study is that war tends to peak toward the close            
              of periods of relative stability in the system's basic                         
              configurations, but produces in its wake a rapid and dramatic set              
              of changes in the system.                                                      
                                                                                             
              To assess this, the major attributes of the political system                   
              (structural, cultural, and material) will be specified, measured,              
              and analyzed for direction and magnitude of change, singly and in              
              combination.  The frequency and severity of international war will             
              also be measured over time in an effort to ascertain the extent to             
              which war increases after periods of system constancy/rigidity and             
              thus precedes and helps account for major system change,  Thus,                
              war, is seen largely as a precursor and catalyst of system change              
              rather than a consequence of such change.                                      
                                                                                             
              This research continues the Correlates of War project begun by the             
              Principal Investigator which examines the incidence of war from                
              1816 to the present.
