Abstract    :
                   The project is directed at the optical fiber drawing process              
              in an effort to improve the quality of the fiber, by reducing the              
              defects and irregularities generated in the process, and to                    
              increase the draw speed, by enhancing the cooling rate.  The                   
              thermal transport and material flow processes associated with the              
              drawing of optical fiber play a very important role in determining             
              the quality of the fiber obtained and the optimum draw speed.  A               
              detailed numerical and experimental study will be performed to                 
              investigate the effect of the transport phenomena on the quality               
              of the fiber, particularly on defect generation, and the                       
              enhancement of the heat transfer rate to increase draw speeds and              
              reduce distances needed for cooling the fiber to a desired                     
              temperature level.  The temperature distribution in the material,              
              the surface profile in the neck down region, heat transfer rates               
              and material distribution in the process are to be determined                  
              numerically, using the finite volume approach for the axisymmetric             
              problem under consideration and employing the experimental results             
              for the validation of the model and of the numerical scheme.                   
                   The detailed results obtained are expected to contribute to               
              a better understanding of the basic transport processes involved               
              and to provide a scientific basis for improving existing                       
              procedures, impacting on processes such as high speed drawing, low             
              cost of fiber fabrication, draw induced defect generation, ultra               
              low loss fiber development, thermally induced phase separation and             
              crystallization during drawing of non-oxide glasses, residual                  
              stress generation, etc.
