Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This project will test ideas about the effects of individual plant             
              species and lifeforms on ecosystem function in the central                     
              grassland region.  The focus will be on the influence of species               
              and lifeforms on soil resource availability using three levels of              
              investigation: process studies at the Central Plains Experimental              
              Range, site comparisons across a regional gradient, and simulation             
              analyses.  Process studies will focus on elucidating the                       
              relationships among plant litter chemistry, biomass allocation,                
              soil organic matter and nutrient supply.  A comparative study                  
              across a regional gradient will test the extent to which                       
              environmental controls may mitigate or increase the importance of              
              species characteristics.  Finally, the investigators will conduct              
              simulation analyses to evaluate the potential influence of                     
              changing species composition over time at several sites that cross             
              the regional gradient; this simulation will test the long-term                 
              consequences of patterns observed in the field.
