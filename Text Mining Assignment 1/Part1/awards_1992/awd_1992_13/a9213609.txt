Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  CEDAR is a 3-phased aeronomy initiative that is recognized                
              within both national and international communities.  Since the                 
              fundamental concept of the program involves collaborative and                  
              community-wide use of resources as well as multi-institution                   
              campaigns and science analysis activities, there is a clear need               
              for coordination.  The basic role of the CEDAR Science Steering                
              Committee (CEDAR-SSC) is to provide for coordination and                       
              information transfer throughout the U.S. aeronomy community as well            
              as in the international realm.  CEDAR is currently in Phase II of              
              the program, durieng which time there will be extensive funded                 
              science campaign activities as well as activities involving                    
              instrument and facility development and upgrades.  Members of the              
              steering committee are selected by the NSF Program Directors for               
              the Aeronomy and Upper Atmospheric Facilities sections of the                  
              Atmospheric Sciences Directorate in consultation with the current              
              SSC members.                                                                   
                                                                                             
                   During the next two years, the committee will meet regularly              
              to discuss the various issues involving campaign organization,                 
              instrument operation, the program for the annual CEDAR summer                  
              workshop, promotion of CEDAR in the national and international                 
              sphere, facility operation, and science symposia planning.
