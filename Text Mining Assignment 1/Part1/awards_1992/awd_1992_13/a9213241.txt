Abstract    :
              This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation Program                 
              will help the Department of Chemistry at Michigan State                        
              University to acquire Sparc II workstations and some ancillary                 
              equipment.  The areas of chemical research that will be                        
              enhanced by the acquisition include:                                           
                                                                                             
              1.  Chemistry of Highly Reactive Mononuclear and Polynuclear                   
                  Transition Metal Cations                                                   
                                                                                             
              2.  The Study of the Molecular Basis of Procaryote/Eucaryote

              3.  Organic Ferromagnets and Odd-Electron Sigma Bonds                          
                                                                                             
              4.  Chemistry of Soluble Metal Polychalcogenides                               
                                                                                             
              %%%                                                                            
              Chemists carrying out frontier research are relying more and                   
              more on computers that are capable of handling sophisticated                   
              simulations, data analysis and graphics software.  The                         
              workstations which will be purchased with this grant are not                   
              only powerful and cost effective computers by themselves, but                  
              will serve also as communication links to allow transfer of                    
              data to and from other workstations and to provide access to                   
              remotely located more powerful computers.
