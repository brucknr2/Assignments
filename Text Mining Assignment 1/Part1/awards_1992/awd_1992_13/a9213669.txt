Abstract    :
              Atomic structures and chemical reactions in solid surfaces will be             
              investigated with a variety of techniques that utilize pulsed beams            
              of ions with kinetic energies from 1 to 15 keV.  The composition               
              and atomic geometry of the surfaces will be determined as a result             
              of these measurements.  Calculations of the scattering cross                   
              sections from models of the surfaces will augment geometrical                  
              considerations in determining the correct surface structures.  The             
              films of interest will be supported primarily on silicon(111)                  
              surfaces.  The interactions between adsorbed species such as silver            
              and gold, silver and gallium, and silver and phosphorus will be                
              determined in initial experiments; more complex films will be                  
              investigated later.  Another study will follow the course of a                 
              chemical reaction, the gold catalyzed oxidation of silicon at low              
              temperatures, as it occurs on the surface.  Ion scattering                     
              techniques will be evaluated to see if they can be generally useful            
              for studies of gas-surface kinetics.
