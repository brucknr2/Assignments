Abstract    :
              Recent increases in VLSI processor speeds have not been                        
              matched by proportionate increase in the number of I/O pins                    
              that connect processors to off-chip memory. Bandwidth between                  
              processor and off-chip memory has become the primary                           
              constraint to VLSI system performance.  A compression scheme                   
              know as Dynamic Base Register Caching (DBRC) has been                          
              developed that reduces address pin requirements by a factor of                 
              two without incurring a significant performance penalty or                     
              implementation cost.  This work will be extended along several                 
              fronts to further reduce bandwidth requirements between                        
              processor and memory.                                                          
                                                                                             
                   (1) Schemes that have the potential to achieve even                       
                       higher levels of compression by exploiting successor                  
                       information to predict address references will be                     
                       explored.                                                             
                                                                                             
                   (2) Analogous compression schemes for data will be                        
                       investigated.  (Preliminary measurements show that                    
                       data, like address information, is highly redundant,                  
                       so a simple compression scheme may be possible.)                      
                                                                                             
                   (3) Finally, trace data will be analyzed to establish                     
                       tight upper and lower bounds on the information                       
                       content of address and data reference streams.                        
                       Accurate bounds will indicate how much compression is                 
                       possible, as well as how much schemes can be                          
                       improved.
