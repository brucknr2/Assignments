Abstract    :
              This project in the Theoretical and Computational Chemistry                    
              Program of the Division of Chemistry involves the development                  
              of a quantum dynamical theory for describing condensed phase                   
              processes.  This theory is based on integrals over paths in                    
              classical phase space.  A related aim of the project is the                    
              complete analysis of a new model for quantum Brownian motion;                  
              this is of fundamental importance since such motions of                        
              particles represent the simplest condensed phase dissipative                   
              process.

              Modern mathematical methods which unite classical and quantum                  
              mechanical descriptions of the motions of particles are being                  
              used in this study to develop new theories of chemical reaction                
              rates in both liquids and solids.
