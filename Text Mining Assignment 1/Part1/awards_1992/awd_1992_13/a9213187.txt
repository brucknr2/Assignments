Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  Until recently, the role dead and dying trees play in the                 
              global carbon cycle has been ignored.  Preliminary estimates                   
              indicate tree mortality amounts to a substantial global flow of                
              4-17 X 1015 grams of carbon per year and that global stores of                 
              dead wood could be in the range of 85 to 295 X 1015 grams of                   
              carbon.  This indicates that a major detrital flow and pool has                
              been ignored, with potentially large consequences for balancing                
              past, current and future global carbon budgets.  Moreover, this                
              information is required to develop strategies to conserve and                  
              sequester carbon in the future.  The proposed project will study               
              woody detritus production, decomposition, nutrient                             
              mineralization, and stores in Russian taiga forests.  This work                
              takes advantage of a 60 year-old permanent plot system which                   
              presents a unique opportunity to rapidly increase understanding                
              of woody detrital dynamics in this part of the globe.  Long-term               
              tree mortality records will allow us to examine how woody                      
              detritus production varies with species of tree, stocking                      
              density, and succession.  Moreover, these records provide a                    
              series of trees with varying time since death that can be used to              
              estimate decomposition and nutrient mineralization rates.                      
              %%%                                                                            
              By knowing woody detrital input, decomposition, and current                    
              stores, we will estimate whether coarse woody debris is                        
              increasing, decreasing or stable during succession.  Coupled with              
              other existing plot data (such as living biomass) this data will               
              allow us to estimate dead wood stores and inputs from existing                 
              large-scale forest survey data.  Aside from providing a much                   
              needed database for a forest type of global significance, the                  
              proposed project will help develop the local expertise needed to               
              carry out more extensive regional studies.
