Abstract    :
              This project focuses on control strategies for power                           
              systems when they are operating near their limits.                             
              I is attempting to extend the L infinity robustness                            
              results to include complex signals.  This of specific                          
              interest to the robustness analysis of power systems,                          
              were load changes and network admittance changes                               
              result in uncertainty dealing with complex                                     
              admittances.  In addition, the HVDC and SVC                                    
              control will be incorporated in the robustness                                 
              control procedure.  A systematic procedure to                                  
              design HVDC and SVC control parameters is also                                 
              proposed.  The analytical methods proposed and                                 
              the algorithms developed will be tested on a                                   
              realistic power network and the results obtained                               
              will be compared with those obtained by                                        
              conventional analysis.
