Abstract    :
                   An REU site project for women and minorities will be                      
              established in the Department of Physics at the University of                  
              Chicago.  The overriding objective of this project is to                       
              actively encourage members of underrepresented minority groups                 
              and women to pursue careers in physics.  This project is part                  
              of a comprehensive program undertaken by the Department to                     
              increase enrollment of women and minorities in physics in                      
              general and in particular in the graduate Ph.D. program as                     
              well.  The project will consist of placing 10 selected                         
              individuals within research groups of different faculty for a                  
              10 week period each summer.  These projects will cover a                       
              variety of Physics research areas (for the most part                           
              experimental) including high energy physics, cosmic ray and                    
              space physics, condensed matter physics, nonlinear dynamics,                   
              chemical physics, and astrophysics.  The research experience                   
              will be augmented by the availability of informal review and                   
              advising sessions with members of the Physics faculty.
