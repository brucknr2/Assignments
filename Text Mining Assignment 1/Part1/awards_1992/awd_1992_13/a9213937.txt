Abstract    :
              The focus of this research will be to use directed hydrogen                    
              bonding interactions to control the size and shape of                          
              self-assembling organic structures in both solution and in the                 
              solid state.  The first goal of thew work is to understand the                 
              structural features necessary for the self-organization of                     
              different cyclic and linear hydrogen bonded aggregates, some                   
              unsubstituted and some with photoactive functionality attached.                
              The second goal is to understand the energetics of                             
              self-assembly and the balance between the favorable enthalpy                   
              and unfavorable entropy of aggregate formation.

              With this award, the Synthetic Organic Program is supporting                   
              the research of Dr. Andrew D. Hamilton of the Department of                    
              Chemistry at the University of Pittsburgh.  Professor Hamilton                 
              will focus his work on the design, synthesis and evaluation of                 
              self-assembling organic structures.
