Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This study is designed to identify the spatial and temporal                    
              patterns of fungi in the dens of two species of desert rodents,                
              (kangaroo rats and woodrats) at the Sevilleta LTER site.  These                
              dens are known to be foci of fungal populations, which influence               
              many aspects of community dynamics and ecosystem processes, from               
              food storage behavior of the rodents to decomposition of woody                 
              material.  Small tubes will be placed in the dens and used as                  
              sampling ports, allowing repeated sampling from the same location              
              within the dens.  Six locations within six adjacent, core, dens                
              will be sampled four times a year for two years.  Concurrently,                
              two transects of six dens each will be sampled at geometrically                
              increasing distances up to 3.2 km from the core dens.  The                     
              samples will be analyzed for fungal diversity, growth                          
              characteristics, and growth compatibility.  The results will                   
              reveal important aspects of microbial dynamics in settings that                
              are known to be ecologically important.
