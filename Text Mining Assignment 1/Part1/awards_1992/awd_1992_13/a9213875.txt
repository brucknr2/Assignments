Abstract    :
              This research planning grant will enable Dr. Pamela Shapiro to                 
              initiate a research program which entails the synthesis of bent                
              metallocene complexes with novel heteroannular bridges. The                    
              bridges will involve the group 13 elements B, Al, or Ga. These                 
              have the virtue of presenting an opportunity for switching                     
              between different reaction states through coordination with                    
              Lewis bases. The effect of chiral Lewis bases will also be                     
              investigated and it will be determined whether chirality can be                
              induced at the metal center.

              Research planning grants are awarded to women who have not yet                 
              been awarded federal funding for their research. Dr. Shapiro is                
              a new faculty member at the University of Idaho and will be                    
              initiating a research program leading to the preparation of a                  
              class of novel catalytic molecules which could become                          
              commercially important in the polymer industry.
