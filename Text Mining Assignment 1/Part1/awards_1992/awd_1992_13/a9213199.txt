Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Nerve cells communicate with each other and with muscle cells at               
              specialized regions called synapses.  The transmitting cell is                 
              capable of converting an electrical signal into the release of a               
              chemical signal, and the receiving cell responds to this chemical              
              signal.  Ion channels are membrane proteins that are essential both            
              for sending and receiving these signals.  The sodium channel is an             
              ion channel permeable only to sodium ions and is concentrated in               
              muscle membrane at the neuromuscular junction.  Patch clamp                    
              electrophysiology confocal microscopy of sodium channels labeled               
              with tagged antibodies, and molecular techniques will be used to               
              study the development and regulation of sodium channels at the rat             
              neuromuscular junction.  In addition, experiments will be done to              
              identify molecules, possibly released by the nerve, that are                   
              responsible for the aggregation and immobilization of sodium                   
              channels at the synapse.  These studies will provide fundamental               
              information on the development and regulation of molecules critical            
              to synaptic transmission and neuromuscular function.
