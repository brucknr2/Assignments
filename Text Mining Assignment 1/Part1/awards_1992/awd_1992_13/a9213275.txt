Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This project supports research on two topics that relate to                    
              the effects of processing flows on the properties of complex                   
              fluids.  The first concerns the mechanisms and conditions for                  
              breakup of viscous or viscoelastic drops in shear flows, and                   
              thus addresses one of the basic mechanisms by which one fluid                  
              is dispersed in another during mixing or blending processes.                   
              The second examines the velocity and concentration                             
              distributions that occur due to shear-induces particle                         
              migration effects in concentrated suspensions.  In both cases,                 
              the proposed research will be primarily experimental.  The                     
              technological significance of the investigation is related                     
              primarily to the development of a basis for predicting the                     
              changes that occur in suspension-like complex fluids during                    
              processing, and thus how processing flows may be used to                       
              modify or control bulk properties of materials that are                        
              produced from such fluids.//
