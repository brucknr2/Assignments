Abstract    :
                 This is the first year funding of a three year continuing                   
              effort.  This is research to test the feasibility of obtaining                 
              images of brain electrical activity related to information                     
              processing and learning while people use different types of                    
              computer interfaces.  The first part of the effort is to extract               
              electroencephalographic (EEG) signals related to cognitive aspects             
              of computer use from contaminating potentials generated by eye                 
              movements and muscle activity.  A formal experiment will then be               
              conducted in which subjects acquire skill in using both a graphical            
              and non-graphical user interface to perform two text-editing tasks             
              (correcting typographical or semantic errors).  Neural-network                 
              pattern discrimination will be used to find the differences between            
              the EEG spatial patterns for the typographic an semantic tasks, as             
              well as how the patterns change as subjects learn to use each type             
              of user interface.  Successful completion of this project should               
              pave the way for using EEG measures to investigate problems in                 
              human-computer interaction.
