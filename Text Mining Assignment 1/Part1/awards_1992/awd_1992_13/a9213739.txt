Abstract    :
               This project investigates the theory and  computation of optimization problems
              and variational  inequalities based on their equivalent formulation as a   of
              nonsmooth equations.  On the theoretical side, the goal is  to gain, through
              the development of a comprehensive theory   nonsmooth equations via their
              approximations, a better  understanding of the sensitivity, stability, and
              other  instrinsic properties of these mathematical programs.  On the 
              computational side, the goal is to develop, relying on  generalizations of the
              classical Newton methods for smooth  equations to the nonsmooth context, some
              robust, globally,   locally quadratically convergent algorithms for solving
              these  mathematical programs.  The research is built  on work in recent years
              which has demonstrated the  fruitfulness of this nonsmooth-equations approach
              to  variational inequalities, complementarity problems, and  nonlinear
              programs.
