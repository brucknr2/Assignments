Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  We plan to use a powerful combination of technique - High-                
              Resolution LEED, scanning tunneling microscope (STM) and diffuse               
              light scattering (DLS) to study the kinetics of interfacial                    
              processes from the atomic to the sub-micron scale.  Included will              
              be the growth, morphology and kinetic roughening transition of                 
              metal films on metals and of metal films on semiconductors from                
              sub-monolayer to many layers thick.  The goal is to better                     
              understand and to control the interfacial processes at the atomic              
              level.
