Abstract    :
                   This research utilizes complementary phylogenetic and                     
              population genetic information to infer modes of speciation in the             
              cave spider Nesticus.  The nesticid spiders of the Appalachian                 
              region are a recently diverged, species-rich lineage that provides             
              an excellent system for studying both the geographic and                       
              populational contexts of speciation.  The sister-species                       
              relationships of Nesticus will be estimated, and in combination                
              with biogeographic evidence from other cavernicolous clades, will              
              define how historical geology and geomorphology have influenced                
              patterns of taxonomic diversity.  To complete the analysis,                    
              research efforts will be directed at assessing how the population              
              genetic attributes of the species under study might have influenced            
              the speciational process.  To this end, the ancestral population               
              structure of phylogenetically defined parental species will be                 
              characterized, along with the type of sampling event which gives               
              rise to daughter species.  This historical inference will be                   
              derived from a comparative analysis of the amount, the rate of                 
              change, and the geographic pattern of genetic variation for mtDNA              
              and nuclear DNA genetic systems.
