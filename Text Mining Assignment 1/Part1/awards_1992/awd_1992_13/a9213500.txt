Abstract    :
              The Parallel Performance Visualization (PARASEER) project applies              
              the metaphor of "visual abstraction," proven successful in                     
              scientific visualization, to the problem of visualizing parallel               
              performance information.  A formal methodology is developed for                
              mapping parallel performance data to visual displays based on a                
              theory of "performance behavior abstraction" and "performance                  
              views."  The methodology is implemented as a high-level,                       
              representational framework that can be used to describe how,                   
              independent of graphics technology, conceptual performance                     
              characteristics embodied in the performance abstractions are                   
              rendered in the performance views.  The ultimate goal of the                   
              PARASEER project is to explore new parallel performance                        
              visualization techniques and to evaluate their effectiveness in                
              real parallel performance problem domains.  In addition to the                 
              formal framework for performance visualization design, PARASEER                
              will take two approaches to developing performance display                     
              graphics.  The first builds interfaces to existing data                        
              visualization software to provide a flexible environment for                   
              performance display prototyping.  This approach leverages the                  
              tools' capabilities for handling large data sets, their support for            
              distributed processing, and their extensible visualization to                  
              graphical user interface software to provide more programmatic                 
              performance visualization support.
