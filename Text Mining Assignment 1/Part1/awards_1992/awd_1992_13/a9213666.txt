Abstract    :
                   Professor Walker will investigate collisions occurring at                 
              ultracold temperatures between atoms confined in a magneto-optic               
              trap.  By studying the dependencies of the collision rates on                  
              detuning, intensities, and polarizations of optical probes,                    
              detailed information will be obtained on the new physics of                    
              collisions in dissipative environments.
