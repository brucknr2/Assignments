Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This research studies theoretically and experimentally                         
              adsorption of solute from near critical fluids onto stationary                 
              phases.  Theoretically, statistical mechanical integral                        
              equations will be used to describe the equilibrium                             
              thermodynamics of solute partitioning, and this will lead to                   
              equations for partial molar enthalpies, volumes and ultimately                 
              partition coefficients.  Experimentally, a chromatographic                     
              technique will be used to acquire adsorption data.  Both lines                 
              of research will focus in particular on how the adsorption of                  
              solute changes when the solvent is a mixture of two                            
              supercritical fluids in their near critical region.  For this                  
              case, the proposed research will study the possibility that by                 
              varying the solvent composition the behavior of the solute                     
              towards the solvent can be modulated from attractive to                        
              repulsive.
