Abstract    :
              This grant will be used to support attendance of approximately                 
              ten US scientists from academia and research institutes at a                   
              four day conference on Catalytic Combustion at Chernogolovka                   
              (former Soviet Union) in September, 1992.  The main purpose of                 
              this conference is the sharing of US and Russian ideas on this                 
              topic, in which the Russians have made numerous significant                    
              advances.  The Russian hosts will pay all local expenses for                   
              the participants, with the NSF support being used to help                      
              defray travel expenses of the US participants.                                 
                                                                                             
              This workshop will provide an opportunity for establishment of                 
              productive collaborations with likely significant impact on                    
              future US research in the area of catalytic combustion, an                     
              important technological process as regards energy utilization                  
              and pollution control.  Direct contact with Russian                            
              scientists, who have considerable achievements in this area,                   
              is anticipated to have beneficial effects in revitalizing US                   
              research and development in the field of catalytic combustion                  
              via provision of unique insights into this process.
