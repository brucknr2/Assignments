Abstract    :
                   Ion channels are large proteins that allow current in the                 
              form of ions to pass across cell membranes.  The inter-                        
              relationships of a large variety of ion channels shape the                     
              electrical signals of the neuro-muscular system.  Single channels              
              patch clamp recordings provide important information about these               
              channels.  The apparently random character of the recorded                     
              currents has led to the widespread use of stochastic models.  We               
              propose to investigate a number of problems that arise in                      
              modeling the stochastic behavior of ion channels and in the                    
              analysis of patch clamp recordings.                                            
                   The flow of electrical charge is fundamental to the                       
              operation of the nervous system and its interaction with the                   
              muscular system.  At a microscopic level, charge is conducted                  
              through channels in the cell membrane called ion channels.  The                
              pioneering work of Sakmann and Neger, for which they received the              
              Nobel Prize, allows direct measurement of the current flow                     
              through a single ion channel.  The resulting recordings reveal                 
              that the channels open and close in a random fashion and                       
              consequently methods of probability and statistics have played an              
              important role in the analysis of the recordings.  We propose to               
              investigate a number of problems that arise in such analyses.
