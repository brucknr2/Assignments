Abstract    :
                   A conference of microbial taxonomists and ecologists will be              
              held to consider the problems of assessing and understanding the               
              biodiversity of bacteria.  A major goal of the conference is to                
              set priorities on the research needs in bacterial diversity.                   
              Topics to be addressed include the difficulties of recovering                  
              bacteria from natural habitats, the challenges of developing an                
              inventory of known species, the isolation of new species from                  
              extreme and remote habitats, the biogeography of bacteria, and                 
              the preservation of novel habitats, and their procaryobiota. The               
              conferees will discuss how data on the characteristics of new                  
              species should be analyzed and disseminated.  The recommendations              
              from the conference will be published in international journals                
              seen by scientists with an interest in this field.
