Abstract    :
                   This award is to research and develop an ultrasonic based                 
              sensor for the in-situ monitoring of the precipitation hardening               
              process in materials, in close cooperation with an industrial co-              
              sponsor.  This will enable the on-line monitoring and control of               
              heat treatment facilities in aircraft manufacturing plants with                
              improvements in manufacturing efficiency and quality.  The  basis              
              of sensor design approach is the relationship between sound wave               
              velocity and the elastic moduli and elastic behavior of the                    
              material in the proximity of metallurgical reactions, such as                  
              precipitation hardening.                                                       
                   The development of this sensing capability, in close                      
              coordination with a major aerospace manufacturer, will foster a                
              relationship between academic and industry participants, while                 
              improving the efficiency of an operation in the manufacturing                  
              sector.
