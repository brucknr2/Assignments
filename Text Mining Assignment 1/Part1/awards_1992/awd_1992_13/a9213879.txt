Abstract    :
                   This project will examine solar activity and solar flares                 
              during 1993 using observations to be obtained at the Swedish Solar             
              Observatory (SSO) on La Palma in the Canary Islands and continuing             
              analysis of existing data. The project expects to obtain                       
              simultaneous observations with the Japanese Yohkoh (Solar A)                   
              satellite. This would provide a unique and invaluable data set                 
              combining high resolution magnetogram, dopplergram, and                        
              chromospheric movies with coronal movies in soft x-rays. The data              
              will be collected using an existing ultra-narrowband tunable filter            
              imaging system (50 m) which has been developed for the Orbiting               
              Solar Laboratory (OSL). This filter and a 1024 x 1024 pixel CCD                
              camera and data system will now be committed to ground based                   
              observations for the foreseeable future. Depending on available                
              resources, the system will be modified to adapt it better to ground            
              based observing conditions.                                                    
                   The observations will be coordinated with Max '91 campaigns               
              and the Yohkoh satellite whenever possible. These data will consist            
              of time sequences of very high spatial and spectral resolution                 
              images which will allow the study of magnetic fields, velocities,              
              and energy release down to 200 km scales.                                      
                   Funds are requested to support observing runs, and data                   
              analysis of these and previously obtained data. Additional support             
              for graduate students and visiting scientists involved in the data             
              analysis will come from Lockheed Independent Research (IR) funds.              
              The equipment will be borrowed from other programs or provided by              
              Lockheed or SSO.
