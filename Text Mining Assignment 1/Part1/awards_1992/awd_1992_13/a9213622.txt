Abstract    :
              This grant from the Organic Dynamics Program supports the                      
              continuing work of Professor Richard G. Weiss at Georgetown                    
              University.  The conversion of ordered assemblies of                           
              liquid-crystalline and related molecules to gels and chiral                    
              hollow cylinders will be studied.  The structural and dynamic                  
              features of the component molecules will be correlated with the                
              behavior of their aggregates in order to identify the salient                  
              properties responsible for the most efficient gelator molecules                
              and the most stable hollow cylinders.  Stabilization of unusual                
              molecular assemblies will be attempted with metals and by                      
              polymerization.                                                                
              %%%                                                                            
              The ability of some molecules to form well defined ordered                     
              assemblies in solution will be examined.  The goal of the                      
              research is to identify the requirements for transforming                      
              single molecules which form ordered assemblies into devices                    
              which are capable of performing specific tasks on molecular                    
              and macromolecular scales.  The results from this study should                 
              be useful in a wide range of applications.
