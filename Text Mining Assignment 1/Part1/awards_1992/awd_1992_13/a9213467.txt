Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Habituation is a process by which organisms come to show reduced               
              response to a stimulus as a function of repeated stimulation.  Once            
              habituation has taken place, the response remains low over a period            
              of time, suggesting that the organisms remembers that this stimulus            
              is the same one it is has encountered previously.  Thus,                       
              habituation is a simple form of learning.  This award to Dr. Alice             
              Powers will investigate the neural basis of the blink reflex and               
              habituation of that reflex.  First the anatomy and physiology of               
              the reflex will be examined.  Then a study will be conducted                   
              investigating whether the interval between consecutive stimuli                 
              affects habituation of the blink reflex.  These studies will                   
              provide the basis for further work investigating the brain                     
              mechanisms of habituation and will contribute to understanding of              
              the way in which the brain mediates learning.***t//
