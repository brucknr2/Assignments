Abstract    :
                 A bacterial flagellum is driven at its base by a rotary motor               
              comprising a rod and set of rings embedded in the cell wall and                
              cytoplasmic membrane.  The energy for rotation is supplied by an               
              electrochemical proton gradient.  The motor spins alternately                  
              clockwise and counterclockwise, with a bias depending on sensory               
              transduction, for example, on the cell's response to chemical                  
              stimuli (chemotaxis).  Studies of the biochemistry and physiology              
              of this system are being made with Escherichia coli and a motile               
              Streptococcus.  E. Coli is being used because the structure of its             
              motors can be perturbed genetically; Streptococcus is being used               
              because its motors can be energize artificially.  Measurements have            
              been made, either with swimming cells or with cells tethered to                
              glass by a flagellum, of protonmotive force, proton flux, torque               
              and speed.  Mutants of the torque-generating elements MotA and MotB            
              have been isolated and characterized.  This work has led to a model            
              for the motor consistent with existing experimental data that is               
              being subjected to further test.  The goal is an understanding of              
              flagellar rotation at the molecular level, or more broadly, of how             
              living things use chemical energy to do mechanical work.                       
              %%%                                                                            
              Motility is a critical phenomenon of living things.  In the world              
              of bacteria, flagellum-mediated swimming movement allows for                   
              responses to chemical or physical stimuli (such as nutrients,                  
              light, barriers) which are necessary for alleviating colonial                  
              overcrowding, sustenance of individual bacteria, and genetic                   
              mating.  The bacterial flagellum and its motor are tiny, yet                   
              effective.  In addition to providing an understanding of the                   
              molecular basis for biological behavior, the results of this                   
              research could find usefulness in nanofabrication or biomaterials              
              research (e.g., using natural or artificial flagella as switches).
