Abstract    :
              This investigation, carried out under the "Engineering Faculty                 
              Internships" program, will be a joint project involving the                    
              faculty member as PI and a co-investigator from industry. The                  
              research objective is to determine the influence of initial                    
              materials quality (e.g., initial size and spatial distribution of              
              inherent material inhomogeneities) on the fatigue like of                      
              structural components.  The manner in which "small" fatigue                    
              cracks initiate from materials inhomogeneities, extend by cyclic               
              loading, interact with adjacent flaws, and coalesce into a single              
              dominant crack which control final fracture will be examined.
