Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This action provides support for a Career Advancement Award to                 
              enable a female scientist to learn the techniques of high                      
              resolution electron microscopy (HREM) and complementary analytical             
              techniques, such as parallel electron energy loss spectroscopy                 
              (PEELS) at the University of Virginia.  Initial research examines              
              the structure of cobalt-tungsten coated graphite fibers, both by               
              themselves and incorporated into a nickel matrix.                              
              %%%                                                                            
              The research explores a composite material that may have synthetic             
              diamond on the fiber surface.  Composite materials are of interest             
              because of their unique tailored properties for use as structural              
              materials.
