Abstract    :
              It is proposed to study fundamental aspects related to the                     
              motion of fluidized assemblies of rigid particles under                        
              inertial, newtonian and non-newtonian viscous, and gravity                     
              effects.  The objective is understanding of the flow                           
              microstructure, by using flow visualization and direct                         
              numerical simulations in the field of particulate two-phase                    
              sedimentation, fluidization and shear flows.  A combined                       
              experimental (high speed camera visualization, nuclear                         
              magnetic resonance imaging) and computational (various two and                 
              three-dimensional methods for two-phase flow) approach has                     
              been planned.                                                                  
                                                                                             
              The project will lead to a better understanding of particulate                 
              flow mechanisms in newtonian and viscoelastic fluids,                          
              including particle interaction mechanisms and flow induced                     
              anisotropy, with application in a large series of industrial                   
              processes in chemical plants and oil extraction facilities.//
