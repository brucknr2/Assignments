Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Funds are requested to help the Caltech astronomy department                   
              computing facility make the transition from a mainframe-based                  
              configuration to one based on the workstation-server model.  NSF               
              funds are to be used to purchase a main server and several                     
              peripherals.                                                                   
                                                                                             
              The proposed configuration will benefit the smaller groups, mainly             
              optical and instrumentation groups, many headed by younger members             
              of the faculty.  These groups have the resources to buy one or two             
              workstations but not expensive peripherals like high quality tape              
              drives, printers etc.  More importantly, in a distributed computer             
              system, maintenance, including regular upgrades of common software             
              like IRAF, PROS, AIPS, Figaro, and public libraries, becomes                   
              difficult.  A properly equipped central server provides an ideal               
              solution to both these problems.
