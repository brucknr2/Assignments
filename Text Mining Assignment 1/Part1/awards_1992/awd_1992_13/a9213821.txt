Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The work to be supported will be a collaboration between Rice                  
              University, Syracuse University and the University of Maryland.                
              It will investigate and develop concepts that will extend  Fortran             
              D to irregular, loosely-synchronous problems.  Fortran D,                      
              extensions of Fortran 77 and Fortran 90 that permit the programmer             
              to specify the distribution of data, a key step in parallelization             
              on distributed memory machines, has already been developed at Rice             
              and Syracuse.                                                                  
                                                                                             
              The research includes four major components: (1) Extending Fortran             
              D to accommodate a wider class of irregular problems and to make               
              it possible to use automatic data mapping strategies.  (2)                     
              Investigation of high level data structures, including data trees,             
              synchronous problems.  (3)  Development of irregular mapping                   
              algorithms and their implementation in the PARTI library.  (4)                 
              Integration of the irregular mapping strategies into the Fortran               
              D compiler under development at Rice and Syracuse
