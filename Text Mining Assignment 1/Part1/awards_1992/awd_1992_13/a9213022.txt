Abstract    :
              The laboratory facilities for performing research                              
              within the power systems - power electronics area                              
              in the Department of Electrical Engineering at the                             
              University of Arkansas, Fayetteville, do not have                              
              the capability of measuring fast transients (in the                            
              nanosecond range) or calculating the harmonic                                  
              spectra of nonsinusoidal waveforms which                                       
              propagate throughout an electric power system.  To                             
              this end, the area faculty believe that the above                              
              needs may be fulfilled by two research workstations.                           
              The Department of Electrical Engineering will use                              
              the grant to purchase the following pieces of                                  
              equipment for each of the above mentioned                                      
              research workstations: a 500 MHz digital storage                               
              oscilloscope, a Fourier spectrum analyzer, a data                              
              acquisition and instrument controller system, three                            
              current probes and amplifiers, a time-to-voltage, a                            
              programmable digital multimeter, and a 3 kV                                    
              isolator.  The listed equipment included with each                             
              research workstation will be used for current and                              
              pending research projects; namely: (a) Design and                              
              Implementation of a Digital Signal Processor-based                             
              Indirect Vector-Controlled Induction Motor Drive,                              
              (b) A Microprocessor-Based Charge Controller for                               
              Nickel-Hydrogen Batteries, (c)  Design of a                                    
              Multipurpose Advanced Static VAr Compensator to                                
              Improve the Performance of Distribution Systems,                               
              and (d) An Assessment of the Quality of Electric                               
              Power at the University of Arkansas, Fayetteville                              
              Campus.
