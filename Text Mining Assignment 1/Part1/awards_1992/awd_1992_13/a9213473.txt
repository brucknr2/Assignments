Abstract    :
              In this Experimental Physical Chemistry project funded by the                  
              Chemistry Division, Prof. Richardson (University of Virginia)                  
              will use time resolved luminescence measurements to study                      
              differential reaction kinetics in mixtures of optically active                 
              components. Parameters derived from these measurements carry                   
              information about both the magnitude and sense ("handedness")                  
              of the luminophore-quencher interactions, and provide a new and                
              useful tool for studying chiral aspects of structural dynamics.

              Molecules whose mirror images are not superimposable have long                 
              fascinated chemists, because of the subtle interplay between                   
              reactivity and symmetry. Prof. Richardson has developed a new                  
              spectroscopic method for studying fast chemical reactions among                
              such molecules, which has the capability of measuring reaction                 
              rates without the need for tedious and difficult separation of                 
              the mirror image species. This method will be used to provide                  
              important information on how the "handedness" of excited                       
              molecular states leads to recognition of similar handedness in                 
              final products. The result will be a deeper understanding of                   
              the stereochemistry of fundamental reaction mechanisms.
