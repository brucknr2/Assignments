                                         ABSTRACT                                            
                                                                                             
                                                                                             
                  This dissertation research will investigate the production                
              of English consonants in sequence.  Articulatory data acquired                 
              with the use of a real-time electropalatographic (EPG) system                  
              will be used to examine temporal patterns of tongue-palate                     
              contact in producing consonant clusters with the goal of                       
              describing coproduction of the underlying articulatory gestures.               
              Acoustic data collected simultaneously will be analyzed to                     
              determine the spectral consequences of the timing of articulatory              
              events as evidenced in the EPG data.  Specifically, this                       
              dissertation will address the following questions.  1) What is                 
              the effect of speaking rate on the coproduction of consonants in               
              sequence?  2) What changes occur in coproduction of consonantal                
              gestures as the number of consonants in a sequence is varied?  3)              
              Does the spatial and/or temporal pattern of tongue-palate contact              
              vary as a function of the linear order of the consonants in the                
              cluster; that is, does an alveolar                                             
              different than a velar                                                         
              location of word boundaries in a consonant sequence affect the                 
              temporal overlap between the gestures?  It is anticipated that                 
              this research will provide significant empirical data with which               
              various models of speech production can be further explicated to               
              more accurately mirror articulatory coproduction and temporal                  
              organization.
