Abstract    :
              The focus of this research program is the investigation of                     
              various hydrodynamic effects on shape, speed, stability, and                   
              extinction limits of premixed gas flames.  Various modeling                    
              techniques will be employed to reduce the study of pertinent                   
              combustion systems to simple approximate problems tractable                    
              either analytically or numerically.  Specific study topics                     
              are: (1) large-scale dynamics of premixed flames propagating                   
              through isotropic systems of small-scale eddies and the                        
              associated cascade-renormalization concept of turbulent flame                  
              speed; (2) extinction limits of premixed flames propagating                    
              through a periodic and a randomized system of eddies; (3)                      
              intrinsic dynamics and pattern formation in premixed flames                    
              and the related questions of flame stabilization and                           
              nonadiabaticity; and, (4) effects of natural convection on the                 
              dynamics of auto-catalytic reaction fronts in liquid solutions                 
              and the related questions of premixed gas combustion.                          
                                                                                             
              Turbulent combustion is a very important area of practical                     
              interest; results of this work should influence the design of                  
              automotive, aircraft, and rocket engines as well as industrial                 
              combustion devices.  The efficient use of fuels and                            
              minimization of production of air pollutants via combustion                    
              processes are dependent on development of a good understanding                 
              of the fundamental issues addressed in this work.
