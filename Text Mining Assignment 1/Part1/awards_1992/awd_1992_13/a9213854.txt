Abstract    :
              The behavior of the atmosphere's most abundant gas, nitrogen, is               
              still not known completely enough to understand many details of                
              the way in which energy coming from the sun is transferred into                
              the earth's upper atmosphere.  Laboratory studies in which                     
              nitrogen is bombarded with photons and particles, and the                      
              resulting behavior carefully studied are needed to resolve                     
              outstanding issues.  This award provides onetime support for a                 
              novel method of probing states of nitrogen of aeronomical                      
              interest by a relatively inexpensive laser method.  It is not                  
              clear that the technique will be broadly applicable, but the                   
              proposed experiment is expected to provide useful data, and                    
              indicate whether a more extensive development of the technique is              
              warranted.
