Abstract    :
              In this Experimental Physical Chemistry Project, funded by the                 
              Chemistry Division, Prof. Marshall (Amherst College) will use                  
              infrared spectroscopy to determine the structure of hydrogen                   
              bonded ammonia complexes prepared in a pulsed supersonic jet.                  
              The ultimate goal of these studies is a complete                               
              characterization of the potential energy surface for binding                   
              with partners that mimic hydrogen bonding in biological                        
              systems.  The function of the jet is to provide simple dimers,                 
              suitable for obtaining rotationally resolved vibrational                       
              spectra.                                                                       
              %%%                                                                            
              Hydrogen bonding pervades chemistry, and is responsible for                    
              such diverse phenomena as the special role of water as a                       
              solvent and the stability, structure and function of proteins                  
              and nucleic acids.  Yet, the fundamental potential energy                      
              associated with hydrogen bonding is not fully understood.                      
              Prof. Marshall (Amherst College) will add to our understanding                 
              of hydrogen bonding by using lasers to probe the structure of                  
              simple hydrogen bonded complexes in the gas phase.
