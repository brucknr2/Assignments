Abstract    :
              This is a career advancement award (CAA) request from R.Y.                     
              Ofoli, an associate professor at MSU, for training in                          
              experimental and theoretical colloid science in the Department                 
              of Chemical Engineering at Carnegie Mellon University.  He                     
              will perform a series of experimental components deal with the                 
              initial rate of flocculation of colloids, and evaluation of                    
              the internal reflection microscopy as a tool for studying                      
              adsorption at the liquid-liquid interface.  The theoretical                    
              foundation will be built also through coursework.  It is                       
              expected that the present award will allow Dr. Ofoli to                        
              redirect his efforts to new research areas and with new                        
              investigation techniques.  During his training at CMU , Dr.                    
              Ofoli will prepare a detailed plan for his independent                         
              research after his return at MSU.
