Abstract    :
                   Over the millennia all the major food plants of the world have            
              come almost exclusively from traditional cultures.  In addition,               
              the majority of medicines came from the experiences of our                     
              ancestors, and even today, components for 25% of the prescription              
              drugs in the U.S. are plant derived.  Thus, it is critical to study            
              the plants utilized by less known indigenous groups before                     
              acculturation leads to the loss of the centuries of accumulated                
              experience and experimentation.  Such ethnobotanical studies are               
              invaluable as well to the native groups studied because most have              
              nor poor written records, and once western customs, foods, and                 
              medicines are adopted, traditional practices are rapidly lost.  The            
              indigenous groups of eastern Nicaragua, the Miskitu, Sumu, and                 
              Rama, have long been protected from western incursion by lack of               
              access.  Recently, however, new logging roads have been built into             
              this area.  Thus, it is imperative for both humankind in general,              
              and for these groups in particular, that studies of medicinal and              
              food plants be initiated immediately.  One shaman in the region,               
              for instance, claims cures using native plants for 139 poisonous               
              snake bites.  This study will focus on the practices and plants                
              used by the shamans, and those more likely to follow traditional               
              practices, i.e., older persons and those in the most remote                    
              regions.
