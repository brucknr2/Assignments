Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Dusty plasmas occur in many space and astronomical environments,               
              among them planetary atmospheres and rings, asteroid zones, comets,            
              protostellar and protoplanetary clouds, supernova remnants, the                
              interstellar medium, and the Earth's ionosphere/magnetosphere.  The            
              objective of this research is to conduct exploratory theoretical               
              studies of the basic and applied collective physics of dusty                   
              plasmas which are pertinent to astrophysical and space                         
              environments.  Exploratory pilot calculations of waves and                     
              instabilities in dusty plasmas will be performed, using a kinetic              
              approach, which would include some of the unique properties of                 
              cosmic charged dust such as grain size distributions.  The effects             
              of charged dust grains on collective plasma properties will be                 
              examined for various astrophysical and space regimes, and                      
              exploratory studies of theoretical techniques to treat those                   
              effects will be conducted.  This is a Career Advancement Award                 
              under the Research Opportunities for Women program.
