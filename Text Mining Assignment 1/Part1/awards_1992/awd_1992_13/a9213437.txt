Abstract    :
                   Tropical intraseasonal oscillations are important to the                  
              short-term climate variability of tropical latitudes and have                  
              connections with low-frequency oscillations throughout the global              
              atmosphere.  Dr. Crum plans to pursue a broad research effort aimed            
              better understanding of the nature of these oscillations.                      
              Conditional heating, where forcing of the large-scale circulation              
              by organized convection occurs in regions of large-scale moisture              
              convergence, has a significant nonlinear effect in determining the             
              structure and horizontal scale of these oscillations.  Dr. Crum                
              will expand upon previous results on conditional heating using                 
              linear models which have been modified to allow for interaction of             
              the tropical waves with the stratosphere and boundary layer.  He               
              plans to examine factors which control the amplitude of these                  
              oscillations, focussing on the roles of moisture and static                    
              stability.  The possible cooperative interaction between convective            
              clouds and the large scale, crucial to many theories, also will be             
              tested in a model with explicitly resolved clouds.                             
                   A better understanding of the tropical intraseasonal                      
              oscillation will lead eventually to a better prediction of a                   
              variety of weather phenomena.
