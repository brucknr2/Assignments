Abstract    :
              There is no doubt that the pace of species extinction caused by                
              human activity is brisk and alarming.  While this process cannot               
              reasonably be expected to stop completely, one can still have the              
              goal to at least preserve the most valuable species. In order to               
              do this, there must be some idea in the minds of citizens about                
              the determinants of a specie's value.  For example, to what                    
              extent are the attributes of a specie such as location,                        
              uniqueness, and intelligence important?  Can people make                       
              tradeoffs among different species that vary on a number of                     
              important attributes?  Are they willing to do so?  Can people's                
              preferences for species be translated into dollar values that can              
              be used to inform public policy?  The purpose of this research is              
              to address these questions.                                                    
                                                                                             
              Since the perceived importance of biodiversity and species                     
              preservation is substantially driven by non-use values,                        
              observation of market behavior is precluded and survey research                
              methods are required.  The first phase of the study uses in-depth              
              interviews and laboratory experiments to thoroughly study                      
              people's mental models of the species domain.  The survey                      
              instrument will be refined in the second phase and the survey                  
              will be administered to a national sample in the third and final               
              phase of the research.  Whereas the first phase will provide                   
              valuable insights into the cognitive processes underlying the                  
              construction of preferences in an important and unfamiliar                     
              domain, the survey results will provide policy makers with                     
              quantitative and defensible estimates of the public's values for               
              ecosystems and species preservation.
