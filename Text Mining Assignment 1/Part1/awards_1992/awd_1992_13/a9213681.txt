Abstract    :
              In this project in the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program                 
              of the Chemistry Division, Curl and Tittel of Rice University                  
              will investigate the high resolution infrared spectra of free                  
              radical species using infrared kinetic spectroscopy.  The                      
              absorption infrared spectra of free radicals prepared using                    
              excimer laser photolysis is obtained using a single-frequency                  
              continuous-wave infrared probe laser by means of a difference                  
              frequency generation scheme developed previously by these                      
              investigators.  Transient radicals to be studied include C4H,                  
              HCCO (ketenyl), HCCCO (propynonyl), and HCCCH (propargylene).                  
              A technique for observing the high resolution spectra of                       
              radicals cooled in a supersonic jet expansion will continue to                 
              be developed and applied to analyzing the CO stretching                        
              vibrations in CH2OH (hydroxymethyl).                                           
              %%%                                                                            
              Free radicals are highly reactive, transient species which are                 
              produced as intermediates in many different chemical reactions.                
              In this research project transient free radicals will be                       
              produced, and their characteristic absorptions of infrared                     
              radiation, that is, their vibrational spectra, will be examined                
              for the information they can provide on the structure and                      
              nature of these short-lived species.  Such information has a                   
              bearing on the fundamental nature of chemical bonding in these                 
              important reaction intermediates and impacts our understanding                 
              of such diverse areas as combustion reactions and molecules in                 
              interstellar media.
