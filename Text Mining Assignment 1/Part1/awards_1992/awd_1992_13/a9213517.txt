Abstract    :
                   Research in intermediate energy nuclear physics will be                   
              carried out at IUCF, CERN, and CEBAF.  The IUCF work will                      
              probe threshold pion production via a new technique - recoil                   
              detection - made possible by the use of ultra-thin targets in                  
              the IUCF cooler ring and internal target facility.  An array                   
              of silicon strip detectors built by the Northwestern group                     
              will be used for this purpose.  The CERN experiment will                       
              determine the spin structure function of quarks in the proton                  
              and neutron by scattering polarized muons from polarized                       
              nuclear targets.  Planning of electron and photon induced                      
              nucleon knockout experiments at CEBAF will be carried out.                     
              These experiments are designed to explore the quark sub-                       
              structure of nucleons and search for the onset of quark sub-                   
              structure effects in nuclear systems.
