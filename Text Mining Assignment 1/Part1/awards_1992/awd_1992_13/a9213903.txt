              This conference grant supports sessions on the                                 
              theme of design and manufacturing integration                                  
              in a four-day Africa-USA International                                         
              Conference on Manufacturing Technology, to be                                  
              held in Lagos, Nigeria, in January, 1993.  The                                 
              sessions are entitled: Design and Integration                                  
              Issues in Electronics Manufacturing Technology;                                
              Process Technology Planning, Design, and                                       
              Integration in Large Scale Manufacturing,                                      
              Expert System Design for Manufacturing Control,                                
              and Product Modeling Systems that Capture                                      
              Design and Manufacturing Information.  Subjects                                
              to be addressed include: concurrent or                                         
              simultaneous engineering; design theory; design                                
              for feasibility in manufacture, assembly, and                                  
              inspection; and planning and control issues in                                 
              modern manufacturing.                                                          
                                                                                             
              The meeting will bring together key researchers                                
              in design and automated manufacturing from                                     
              industry, national agencies and universities in                                
              Africa and the U.S., to share ideas on the                                     
              practicalities of the new advanced design and                                  
              manufacturing technologies.   The conference                                   
              promises mutual benefit to the U.S. and African                                
              engineers by exposing the participants to new                                  
              perspectives on both problems and solutions in                                 
              industrial development.  This project is                                       
              relevant to the objectives of the Science in                                   
              Developing Countries (SDC) Program with regard                                 
              to strengthening the scientific and engineering                                
              infrastructure in developing countries, and                                    
              increasing the level of cooperation between                                    
              U.S. scientists and engineers and their                                        
              counterparts in developing countries.
