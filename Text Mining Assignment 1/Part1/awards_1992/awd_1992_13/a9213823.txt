Abstract    :
                                                                   9213823  Glinert        
              This is the second year funding of a three-year continuing award with the
              objective of developing a  theoretical basis for multimodal interface design. 
              The basis for the investigation is the interplay  between visual and auditory
              interface (graphics and sound) issues, and also the temporal and dynamic 
              aspects of the abstract objects that are active in the interface.  The
              simultaneous consideration of these  aspects leads to the definition od an
              object-oriented construct called a  metawidget  which is an  abstract object
              with built-in strategies which allow multiple different manners of manifesting 
              themselves to the user.   Among those modes of manifestation are image, sound
              or even combinations  and sequences of the two media.  The implementation will
              consist of suitable microworld  environments for experimentation, used as
              testbeds for controlled experimentation to validate the  theoretical aspects of
              the interface design process as they are developed.  Prototypes of such 
              microworlds include an animated editor for planar graphs and an enhanced
              multimodal interface for  visually impaired - but  not  blind - users.  These
              examples have been used as a preliminary approach  to test potentially useful
              ideas.
