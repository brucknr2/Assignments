Abstract    :
                   Most efforts to enable concurrent engineering to date have                
              focused on developing the tools and techniques for designing                   
              completely new products.  Design in many industries is                         
              volutionary, consisting primarily of incremental changes to                    
              existing products.  This category of design is the target of direct            
              engineering, which is concerned with giving engineers direct access            
              to complete knowledge about the design and manufacture of a part               
              as the part is being designed.  Direct engineering differs from                
              concurrent engineering in that this knowledge is not generated at              
              design time, but is retrieved from an engineering database which               
              completely documents existing designs.                                         
                   The project focuses on developing the key enabling component              
              of direct engineering, the engineering design component for a                  
              specific product, and an automobile crankshaft.  During a summer               
              internship at a major automobile manufacturer, the principal                   
              investigator will work with the co-investigator and other key                  
              personnel to identify the critical crankshaft design variables and             
              their relationships to functional issues, manufacturing,                       
              prototyping, fixture design, tooling, dunnage, etc.  After                     
              completely documenting these relationships for the crankshaft, an              
              appropriate constraint-based product representation will be                    
              developed.  The second stage of the work will result in a prototype            
              computer implementation of the product model to illustrate the                 
              concept of direct engineering for automotive crankshafts.
