Abstract    :
              With the support of the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and                           
              Organometallic Program, Dr. Ronald L. Musselman of the                         
              Chemistry Department, Franklin and Marshall University, will                   
              continue investigations of the electronic structure of                         
              oxygen-bridged iron and copper metalloproteins and of one                      
              dimensional conductors containing metalloporphyrins and square                 
              planar complexes.  Single crystal specular reflectance                         
              spectroscopy will be utilized in characterizing intense charge                 
              transfer transitions in these transition metal complexes.  The                 
              information obtained can help clarify the extent of movement of                
              electrons through the metal backbone or through the pi-system                  
              of stacked macrocycles in conductive polymers.  Similar                        
              information is also useful for understanding the mechanism of                  
              reactivity at the active site of non-heme binuclear proteins                   
              and enzymes, for which the bridged species are models.                         
              Electronic transitions in the visible, ultraviolet, and mid-                   
              infrared regions will be accessible on newly acquired                          
              instrumentation.                                                               
              %%%                                                                            
              The information obtained from polarized reflectance                            
              spectroscopy assists in characterizing the energy and movement                 
              of electrons in solids.  It is thus helpful in determining the                 
              optical properties of crystalline materials or other solids and                
              films.  The technique will be used here to explore the movement                
              of electrons in systems related to biologically important                      
              proteins involved in oxygen and electron transport, and in                     
              conducting polymers.  A number of undergraduate students and                   
              high school teachers will be involved in the conduct of the                    
              research.
