Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This project involves the dissertation research of an                          
              anthropology student from the University of California.  The                   
              student will study changes in male identity in a poor                          
              neighborhood of Mexico City, analyzing how definitions of                      
              masculinity are affected by social constraints from employment                 
              and social activist situations.  Methods include participant                   
              observation, a survey questionnaire of 50 households, and in                   
              depth studies of a sample of 25 households.                                    
                                                                                             
              This research is important because increases in our understanding              
              of gender roles and relations is important to develop policies                 
              affecting out-of-wedlock pregnancies and unwed fathers'                        
              responsibilities to support their children.  Case studies such as              
              these, of individual variations in a social situation known for                
              "machismo", can significantly advance our understanding of why                 
              some men become responsible fathers while others do not.
