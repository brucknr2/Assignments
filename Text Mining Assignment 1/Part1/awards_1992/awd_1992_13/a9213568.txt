Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  The goal of the project is to develop a theoretical model                 
              capable of predicting the turbulent double-diffusive transport                 
              during the continuous alloy ingot casting process, and its                     
              implication on macrosegregation.  These issues, while critical to              
              meeting demands for enhanced performance of the US aerospace and               
              power industries, have not been properly addressed.  The motivation            
              of the work is that for the ingot casting processes of the                     
              production scales, their physical sizes and operating conditions               
              cause the convection field to be in the turbulent regime.                      
              Consequently, contrary to the information gathered from the small              
              scale laboratory studies that the mushy zone is generally thin                 
              everywhere, evidences indicate that turbulent convection makes the             
              instanteous mushy zone thickness and local solutal/thermal                     
              distributions vary considerably.  The classical way of deducing the            
              materials structure based on the casting speed and mean temperature            
              gradient is largely based on the conduction analysis alone, and                
              hence may no longer be valid for the large scale production.  The              
              new model to be developed attempts to address the scaling issue and            
              will be validated by the experimental information specifically                 
              designed for the present collaboration.                                        
                   The research will contribute to the production of defect free             
              metal ingots, which  will improve the productivity of the ingot                
              casting process.
