Abstract    :
              The objective of this proposed study is to                                     
              develop applicable mathematical theories for the                               
              feedback control of nonlinear distributed systems                              
              with free-boundaries.  The main effort is                                      
              focused on systems describable by coupled                                      
              Navier-Stokes and heat equations.  This problem                                
              is motivated from the development of precision                                 
              feedback controls for the crystal growth process                               
              to achieve high quality crystals and high                                      
              productivity.  This problem is of basic                                        
              importance in the manufacturing of                                             
              microelectronic and optoelectronic devices.                                    
              Computer simulation studies will be made for                                   
              determining effectiveness and feasibility of the                               
              proposed feedback controls.  The use of neural                                 
              networks for modelling and real-time control of                                
              the crystal growth process will also be explored                               
              by means of computer simulation using both                                     
              computer generated and real experimental data.
