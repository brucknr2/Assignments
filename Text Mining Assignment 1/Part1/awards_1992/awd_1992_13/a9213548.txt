Abstract    :
              9213548  Beers  This award supports Professor Timothy Beers and a graduate
              student  of Michigan State University to collaborate in astronomical  research
              with Dr. Jesper Sommer-Larsen of the Niels Bohr Institute  of the University of
              Copenhagen, Denmark.  The objective of their  research is to obtain extensive
              new spectroscopic observations of  Field Horizontal Branch (FHB) and apparent
              Main-Sequence A stars in  the halo of the Galaxy.  These data will allow for a
              definitive  study of the kinematics of such stars without the present 
              limitations of small number statistics and kinematic selection  bias. 
              Discussion and refinement of the kinematic and dynamical  models of Vedel and
              Sommer-Larsen are other important aspects of  the collaborative project.     
              This research addresses fundamental questions about the dynamic and  chemical
              history of the galactic halo and disk system.  Results  should advance our
              understanding of the history of the galaxy.    The collaborative arrangement
              will significantly increase the  telescope observing time available to the U.S.
              researchers by  providing access to the European Southern Observatory.  ***
