Abstract    :
                   The main focus of this theoretical work is on pion-                       
              nucleus scattering (elastic, inelastic, charge exchange) at                    
              energies near the delta-resonance.  It will explore the                        
              possible outcomes of hadronic experiments that may be acheived                 
              with future meson facilities.  In addition work will be done                   
              on di-lepton production in heavy ion collisions and the                        
              production of high-spin hadrons in future proposed                             
              intermediate energy reactions.
