Abstract    :
                   This award is to conduct an experimental study and model the              
              functioning of thin film material handling equipment.  This effort,            
              being conducted in close collaboration with an industrial co-                  
              sponsor, will result in a better understanding of such material                
              handling mechanisms and provide a sound theoretical basis for the              
              design of thin film handling equipment.  The test equipment that               
              will be fabricated to conduct the study will be based on the latest            
              mechatronic design techniques, provide for the variation of                    
              critical parameters and include sensors and actuators so that the              
              cause effect relationships can be studied and quantified.                      
                   Material handling of thin films is a frequent occurrence in               
              many electronic equipment and devices in the industrial and                    
              consumer sector.  This research will develop a scientific and                  
              theoretical basis for the design of such equipment, with                       
              competitive benefits to many producers of such equipment.
