Abstract    :
              Ramanathan         A major limitation of real-time distributed computing 
              systems is that communication latency between tasks on different  nodes can be
              large.  This research is directed towards  alleviating this limitation using
              three methods.  First,  algorithms for assigning deadlines to information
              transfers  between tasks are being developed.  Second, partitions of 
              information transfers into messages are being investigated.   Third, routing
              and delivery strategies are being developed.  The  result is a set of solutions
              which can be used to design real-  time communications systems.
