Abstract    :
              Society's need to manage Arctic natural resources presents a                   
              pressing and distinctive case for a methodology to integrate                   
              conflicting economic, social and environmental considerations. This            
              project will compare Russian and American approaches to decision               
              analysis and will focus on an enviromental concern affecting all               
              Arctic nations and calling for joint solutions: the past and                   
              potential contamination of the Arctic and the impacts of industrial            
              development on northern regions and societies.
