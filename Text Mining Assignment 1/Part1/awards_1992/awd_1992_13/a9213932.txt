Abstract    :
              An experimental program aimed at development of a laser-based                  
              technique for non-intrusive in-situ measurement of the                         
              hydroperoxy radical (HO2), a reaction intermediate which                       
              controls the rate of hydrocarbon oxidation in the intermediate                 
              temperature regime and which is important in hydrocarbon                       
              combustion in general, will be carried out.  The technique                     
              utilizes the non-linear interaction between a light source and                 
              an absorbing medium called degenerate four-wave mixing (DFWM).                 
              An existing laser system will be tuned to interact with a low                  
              lying electronic transition which is unique to HO2.  This                      
              spectroscopic feature does not have the spectroscopic                          
              interference problems of other methods proposed for                            
              measurement of HO2.  The program will consist of four major                    
              tasks: (1) assembling a reliable, quantifiable HO2 source; (2)                 
              developing a ClO titration scheme for quantification;                          
              (3)measuring HO2 concentrations produced by the calibrated                     
              source for definition of spectroscopic constants and effects                   
              of such parameters as pressure, temperature, etc; (4)                          
              measuring HO2 in a flow reactor and a flame facility.                          
                                                                                             
              Successful completion of this program will provide a new                       
              diagnostic tool to probe hydrocarbon oxidation and to provide                  
              new insight into the chemistry which limits efficiency and                     
              controls emissions from hydrocarbon combustion systems.
