Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  The object of this research is the measurement of cloud                   
              condensation nuclei (CCN) above and below the stratocumulus clouds,            
              which are a persistent feature of the meteorology of the Azores,               
              and an active objective of Atlantic Stratocumulus Transformation               
              Experiment (ASTEX), June 1992.  When larger concentrations of CCN              
              are incorporated into stratus clouds the albedo can be altered,                
              often in dramatic ways.  Since maritime stratocumulus clouds                   
              comprise a non-trivial fraction of total cloudiness off the west               
              coasts of most continents, the contribution to altered albedo,                 
              perhaps arising from anthropogenic sources of CCN, could be a                  
              significant component in climate change.
