Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This grant investigates fundamentals of hydrogen atom interactions             
              with defects in metals.  Experimental techniques employed are small            
              angle neutron scattering (SANS), transmission electron microscopy              
              (TEM), large angle neutron scattering, and gamma ray diffraction.              
              Recently it has been demonstrated that SANS can reveal directly the            
              spatial profiles of the hydrogen isotope, deuterium, trapped at                
              dislocations and grain boundaries in palladium.  The dependency of             
              the trapping strength on deuterium concentration, defect                       
              concentration, and temperature is examined using SANS.  Determining            
              the associated effects of impurity segregation, such as carbon and             
              sulphur, at dislocations and grain boundaries is an integral part              
              of this program.

              This research adds to the knowledge base related to solute-defect              
              interactions, important to mechanical and physical properties of               
              metals and alloys.
