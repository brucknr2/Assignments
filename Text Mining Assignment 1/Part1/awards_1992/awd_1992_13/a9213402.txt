Abstract    :
                   This research combines phylogenetic study of the Neotropical              
              electric fish family Hypopomidae (Gymnotiformes: Teleostei) with               
              comparative study of electric organ discharge (EOD) and electric               
              organ morphology.  EOD, electric organ, distributional and                     
              ecological data, collected from field work will be mapped onto a               
              phylogenetic hypothesis.  The hypothesis of genealogical                       
              relationships will be constructed from a morphological character               
              data set excluding electric organ morphology.  Application of                  
              character optimization methods will allow historical sequences in              
              the diversification of the EOD/electric organ system to be                     
              identified.  The following questions are addressed: (1) Are EODs               
              species "markers" as some research suggest, i.e. what is the                   
              taxonomic value of EODs and how variable are EODs within a species?            
              (2) Is phylogenetic distance or community association a better                 
              predictor of EOD divergence?  (3) Are complexly structured EODs and            
              accessory electric organs primitive or derived, and how many times             
              have they arisen?  (4) Are particular EOD features consistently                
              associated with particular electric organ morphologies?  (5) Are               
              particular EOD/electric organ features consistently associated with            
              particular habitats/water characteristics?
