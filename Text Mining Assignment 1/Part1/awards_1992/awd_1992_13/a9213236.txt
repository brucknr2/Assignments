Abstract    :
                This grant will fund research through the Small Grants for                   
              Exploratory Research program to investigate the physical conditions            
              in an earthquake hypocentral zone through the decay rate of                    
              aftershocks.  Although the decay rate of aftershocks has been                  
              studied in the past, it has not been satisfactorily explained with             
              a physical basis.  Temperature is one of the candidates for a major            
              controlling factor but establishing a relationship with aftershock             
              decay rate is complicated by lack of data and the potential for                
              other controlling factors.  This work will attempt to isolate the              
              temperature controlling factor by means of Japanese heat flow data             
              in regions of active seismicity.  If successful, the results will              
              provide useful constraints on earthquake nucleation models.  This              
              research is a component of the National Earthquake Hazard Reduction            
              Program.
