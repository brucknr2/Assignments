Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  This experiment is aimed at measuring the structure and                   
              evolution of coastal and estuarine near-surface fronts by using a              
              combination of novel instruments like a moored acoustic imaging                
              SONAR, fully lagrangian floats and an autonomous underwater vehicle            
              equipped with hydrographic sensors. The goal of the exploratory                
              research is to identify the mechanisms and scales responsible for              
              mixing in the upper ocean.
