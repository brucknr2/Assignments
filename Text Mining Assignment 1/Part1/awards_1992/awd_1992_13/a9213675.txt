Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This U.S.-Poland research project in civil engineering                         
              between Dr. Antonio Nanni of Pennsylvania State                                
              University-University Park, and Dr. Andrzej Brandt of the                      
              Institute of Fundamental Technical Research, Polish                            
              Academy of Sciences, Warsaw will entail experimental and                       
              analytical studies to prepare rational methods and                             
              technologies for the strengthening and repair of outdoor                       
              concrete structures (e.g., bridge decks and piers, road                        
              and runway pavements).  The researchers will combine their                     
              experience in:  1.  application of short fiber reinforced                      
              mortars and concretes for repair of concrete structures;                       
              and 2.  strengthening and repair of concrete structures                        
              using fiber-reinforced plastic reinforcement for lateral                       
              confinement or replacement of conventional steel                               
              reinforcement.                                                                 
                                                                                             
              This project in civil engineering fulfills the program                         
              objective of advancing scientific knowledge by enabling                        
              leading experts in the United States and Eastern Europe to                     
              combine complementary talents and pool resources in areas                      
              of strong mutual interest and competence.
