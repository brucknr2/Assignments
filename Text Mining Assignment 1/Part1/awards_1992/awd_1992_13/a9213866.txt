Abstract    :
              The purpose of this project is to complete the research for a                  
              book to explore the interaction of the ideology of human                       
              perfectability and reproductive science and technology.  The                   
              author argues that, in the wake of the new sciences and                        
              technologies of reproduction, standards are being set for the                  
              "perfect child," echoing an older ideal, the "perfect man."  The               
              book examines trends, counter-trends and alternatives to                       
              pressures for a new health hierarchy of birth.  This grant will                
              enable the investigator to study works in feminist and postmodern              
              philosophy that provide a way of examining the idea of human                   
              perfectibility and reproductive science and technology within a                
              network of intersecting, unequal power relationships.  Drawing                 
              especially on feminist interpretations of the European                         
              philosopher Michel Foucault, the investigator finds a framework                
              for illustrating how perfectibility standards are emerging, not                
              through grand design, but through the intersection of the                      
              discourses and practices of differently situated groups:  through              
              medical professionals, parents, researchers, set against                       
              persisting negative attitudes toward people with disabilities.                 
              Feminist postmodernism provides a way of heeding counter-voices                
              from genetic support groups, concerned medical personnel, parents              
              of affected children -- of linking them together and thus of                   
              offering alternative directions for reporductive science and                   
              technology and for framing procreative values and norms.
