Abstract    :
              Geographic Information Systems (GIS) are a                                     
              computer-based system used to capture,                                         
              manage, edit, manipulate, analyze, synthesize                                  
              and output geographically-referenced                                           
              information.  The objective of this workshop is                                
              to convene selected researchers and                                            
              practitioners from academia, government and                                    
              industry to exchange information and ideas                                     
              relating to GIS technology, and to provide                                     
              guidelines for others using or considering the                                 
              use of this technology in geotechnical                                         
              engineering, especially in geotechnical                                        
              earthquake engineering.  The workshop will be                                  
              held in Atlanta, Georgia during the summer of                                  
              1992, at the Georgia Institute of Technology,                                  
              thereby benefiting by the presence on this                                     
              campus of the Center for Geographic                                            
              Information Systems and Spatial Analysis                                       
              Technologies.                                                                  
                                                                                             
              Rapid development of a variety of information                                  
              systems, resulting from the large demand to                                    
              implement this technology, has led to a                                        
              frequent failure to clearly distinguish between                                
              GIS and other similar systems which do not                                     
              have the ability to integrate geographically                                   
              referenced data analytically.  In addition, the                                
              inherent compatibility limitations between                                     
              systems have led to restricted usage of                                        
              databases and the software used to manipulate                                  
              them.  These potential problems will be                                        
              addressed at the workshop.
