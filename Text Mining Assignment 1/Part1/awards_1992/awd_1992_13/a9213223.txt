Abstract    :
                   This award will enable development and deployment of a                    
              production environment for an electronic journal.  The network-                
              based application, which will be particularly suited for remote                
              collaborative research and writing activities, will use                        
              sophisticated on-line editing capabilities.  These will include                
              detailed version-control and provision for the collection and                  
              display of comments (during both the preparation phase and post-               
              publication).                                                                  
                   The 1990s will be the decade of appearance of the electronic              
              journal.  Carefully structured development efforts are essential               
              to doing this successfully.  The right people and the right tools              
              are available to provide confidence that this effort will produce              
              a valuable demonstration of the appropriate technology for these               
              developments.
