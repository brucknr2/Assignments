Abstract    :
              This project pursues an interdisciplinary approach to understanding            
              various aspects of structural dynamics and incorporates the                    
              concepts of signal processing, structural mechanics, control theory            
              and system identification. The objectives of this research are to              
              develop new results, generate scholarly publications, and                      
              interaction with other researchers under a Career Advancement                  
              Award. These are accomplished via participation in technical                   
              conferences here and abroad, collaborative research with other                 
              faculty members located at US Air Force Academy, SUNY/Buffalo, and             
              VPI & State  University at Blacksburg, VA. Experimental                        
              investigations include the development of smart structures                     
              consisting of composite structural members embedded with                       
              piezoceramic or similar other active materials, and their use in               
              identification and control research.***  //
