Abstract    :
                   A major challenge to statistics is the analysis and                       
              visualization of high-dimensional data.  Theoretical foundation                
              and software implementation are among the facets of this                       
              challenge to be undertaken as part of this project.  In a                      
              separate venue, fundamental problems in experimental design are                
              to be examined with attention to Bayesian design, design for                   
              computer experimentation, nonparametric analysis and response                  
              surfaces.                                                                      
                   Increasingly, statistics as a discipline has been moved by                
              the computer: experiments and data structures grow increasingly                
              ambitious and sophisticated as computers gain in power.  This                  
              research links the concepts of effective design and analysis of                
              experiments with the visualization of complex information and                  
              methodologic advances in computational statistics.
