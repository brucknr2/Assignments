Abstract    :
                   The objective of this faculty internship project is the                   
              development of an automated sales order system and its integration             
              with other management systems within an industrial environment.                
              The design of the system is such that no specialized knowledge of              
              products, components or prices is required by the client.  The                 
              structure of the system allows machine orders to be placed and                 
              confirmed without human intervention.                                          
                   This effort draws heavily from concepts of knowledge-based                
              systems and its applicability extends to both manufacturing and                
              construction systems.  The project is viewed as a major step in the            
              development of a long term relationship between the researchers and            
              the sponsoring organization.
