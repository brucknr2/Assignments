Abstract    :
                   A focal plane polarimeter will be constructed for use at                  
              CEBAF by the Rutgers and W&M groups.  In conjunction with a                    
              magnetic spectrometer, this device will determine the                          
              polarization state of protons and other hadrons produced in                    
              electron scattering and photon induced knockout reactions.                     
              The detector consists of a second scattering target (analyzer)                 
              plus tracking chambers before and after the analyzer.                          
              Measurement of the polarization, extracted from the second                     
              scatter angular distribution, will be used to measure the                      
              proton form factor, perform critical tests of models of the                    
              nucleon, of nuclear structure, and of reaction mechanisms                      
              involved in electron scattering.  Wire chamber arrays,                         
              analyzer, support structure, and associated fast electronic                    
              signal processors will be developed.
