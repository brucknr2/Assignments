Abstract    :
              This support will enable the completion of the inventorying and                
              computerization of the type beetle collection at the museum of                 
              Comparative Zoology, Harvard University.  This collection, one of              
              the foremost in the world, is an essential resource to the                     
              entomological community engaged in systematic, ecological and                  
              biodiversity research and education.  This project will make the               
              collection data accessible in electronic format on diskette or                 
              over a network and will significantly enhance the use of the type              
              collection in research and education.
