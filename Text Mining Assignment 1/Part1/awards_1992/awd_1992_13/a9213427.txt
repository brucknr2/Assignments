Abstract    :
                   This project involves safety and fault-tolerance problems                 
              raised in the development of safety-critical computing                         
              systems.  There are many computer applications in which safety                 
              and not reliability or availability is the overriding concern.                 
              Reduced or altered functionality of such systems is acceptable                 
              as long as no harm is done.                                                    
                   Theoretical research will focus on the specification and                  
              design phases of the software lifecycle.  Specifically, the                    
              project will develop a framework of definitions of safety,                     
              establish the responsibility of the software engineer within                   
              that framework, and design software architectures to support                   
              the development of safe software.  It will investigate the                     
              possibility that an enhanced form of software reuse can be                     
              exploited to facilitate rapid development of specifications                    
              and designs for safe software.                                                 
                   Empirical research will focus on a case study which will                  
              involve certain aspects of the software for an experimental                    
              safety-critical medical device.  The device, known as the                      
              Magnetic Stereotaxis System, is a new approach to various                      
              forms of therapy for brain disorders.  Software safety                         
              specifications will be constructed and a prototype built.                      
              Reuse libraries populated by a small number of parts derived                   
              from the case study will be built and used in subsequent                       
              studies of reuse technology.
