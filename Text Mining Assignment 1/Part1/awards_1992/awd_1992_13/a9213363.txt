Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  This project analyzes French and American working class                   
              cultures by drawing on 200 in-depth interviews conducted with                  
              randomly sampled white and African-American working class men                  
              living the New York suburbs and with white and French Algerian                 
              working class men living in the Paris suburbs.  It examines the                
              criteria that these men use to define, and to discriminate                     
              between, worthy and less worthy persons.  Drawing on available                 
              data on French and American upper-middle class cultures, the                   
              study will explore issues such as the extent of working class                  
              resistance to upper-middle class culture, the decline of working               
              class cultural distinctiveness, and cultural difference between                
              majority and minority working class men.                                       
                   This study will make a significant contribution to the                    
              understanding of national cultures and of racial differences                   
              within these cultures.
