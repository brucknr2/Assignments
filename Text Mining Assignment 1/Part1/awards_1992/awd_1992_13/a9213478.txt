Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Particulate material which is exposed to moisture typically                    
              has the surface of each particle coated with a thin film of                    
              water.  It is often necessary to remove this water before the                  
              material can be used.  The water may contain dissolved                         
              substances which are important to recover.  Drying and                         
              recovery are tedious and expensive operations.  A new                          
              technique shows that surfactants spreading at the air-water                    
              interface in such "unsaturated" porous media drag a                            
              significant amount of water with them.  This water movement                    
              occurs with essentially no external energy input.  The                         
              criteria for surfactant effectiveness in moving thin water                     
              films are different from bulk systems, and are not understood.                 
                                                                                             
              The objectives of this research are to understand and optimize                 
              water transport by surfactant spreading.  Definitive                           
              experiments will be conducted using classical surface                          
              chemistry techniques available in the laboratory.  The work                    
              will shed new light on the character of water at interfaces,                   
              and on thin film properties in general.  It has direct                         
              applications to room temperature drying or de-watering                         
              stabilization of building foundations without mechanical                       
              tamping of the earth, and underground mining and environmental                 
              cleanup without expensive excavation.
