Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This proposal emphasizes the synthesis of new ternary tungsten and             
              niobium chalcogenide compounds that contain discrete clusters of               
              transition metal atoms.  This important class of materials exhibits            
              a host of interesting properties ranging from catalytic activity to            
              magnetism and superconductivity.  The synthetic approach to be used            
              is based upon the utilization of superlattice reactants, which                 
              involves separating the two key steps of a solid-state reaction -              
              interdiffusion of the reactant, and crystallization of the                     
              products.  Interdiffusion to an amorphous state is accomplished by             
              tailoring the structure of the initial superlattice reactant.  The             
              crystallization of the resulting amorphous intermediate is                     
              controlled via stoichiometry and/or through seeding of the                     
              composite with isostructural analogues.  Materials characterization            
              and the further development of this synthetic approach is a                    
              significant part of the proposed research, as is extending the                 
              range of properties exhibited by these potentially functional                  
              materials.
