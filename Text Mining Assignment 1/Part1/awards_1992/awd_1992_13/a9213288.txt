Abstract    :
                   The principal investigator will use this award to initiate a              
              research project in the study of infinite entropy billiard                     
              systems with a fractal boundary. She will use Bernoulli theory                 
              and the theory of Brownian motion to study perturbations of the                
              flow. She will attempt to prove the robustness of the Markovian                
              model and investigate dynamical systems with singularities.                    
                   This award will support research in the general area of                   
              dynamical systems. A process which is very simple and easy to                  
              understand locally can become extremely complicated, nonlinear,                
              and difficult to analyze globally. Dynamical systems is the study              
              of this local to global relationship. Many physical systems can                
              best be modeled using this area of mathematics including fluid                 
              flow and turbulence, complex biological systems, mechanical                    
              systems, and chemical reactions.
