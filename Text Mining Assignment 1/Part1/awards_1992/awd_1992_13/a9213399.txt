Abstract    :
              This award is made by the Office of Special Projects in the                    
              Chemistry Division under the Materials Synthesis and Processing                
              Initiative. This research will focus on the synthesis of                       
              organic-inorganic designer solids, specifically thin films                     
              fabricated in a layer-by-layer fashion with two-dimensional                    
              periodicity parallel to the surface and total control of the                   
              composition in the  perpendicular direction. The parallel                      
              sheets will be hexagonal lattices formed by polymerization of                  
              organometallic sandwich complexes, while the vertical pillars                  
              will be carborane-based rods containing a central dipolar                      
              chromophore parallel to the hexagonal sheets and capable of                    
              rotating about the pillar axis in the presence of an external                  
              electric field. The length of the rigid carborane rods will be                 
              varied to provide variable spacing between the parallel sheets                 
              and a novel interfacial technique will be used to build up the                 
              thickness of the thin films.                                                   
              %%%                                                                            
              The synthetic methodolgy developed by this research will                       
              provide the basis for designing layered films with broad                       
              potential across several materials application areas.                          
              Electronic and photonic materials, for example, wave guides,                   
              are envisioned.
