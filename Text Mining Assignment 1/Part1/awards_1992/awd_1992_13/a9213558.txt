Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The goal of this project is to develop new methods for                         
              representing and solving decision problems.  The main focus is on              
              representation based on the framework of valuation-based systems               
              (VBS), a framework capable of representing uncertain knowledge in              
              many different domains including Bayesian probability theory,                  
              Dempster-Shafer's theory of belief functions, Spohn's theory of                
              epistemic beliefs, and Zadeh-Dubois-Prade's possibility theory.                
                                                                                             
              Preliminary results show that VBS representation is more                       
              expressive than both decision trees and influence diagrams, and                
              the solution method is more efficient.  This project will study                
              the expressiveness of VBS representations and the computational                
              efficiency of the VBS solution method.                                         
                                                                                             
              While decision trees are based on the semantics of possible                    
              scenarios and influence diagrams are based on the semantics of                 
              conditional independence, VBS are based on the semantics of                    
              factorization.  In this project, the semantics of VBS will be                  
              extended to include conditional independence.  In addition, the                
              project will begin the development of a coherent decision                      
              calculus for belief functions, epistemic beliefs, and possibility              
              theory.
