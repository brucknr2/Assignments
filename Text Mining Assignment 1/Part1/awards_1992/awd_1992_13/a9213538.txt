Abstract    :
              This project will complete the computerization of the Florida                  
              Museum of Natural History mollusc collection by 1996.  This                    
              collection has international importance to the malacological                   
              studies and the FLMNH is a leading center for malacology                       
              research.  Computerization and curation of this collection will                
              enhance its use in biodiversity studies, systematic and                        
              ecological research and conservation efforts.
