Abstract    :
              Theoretical studies will be conducted on localization problems                 
              associated with the propagation of light in crystals.  In                      
              particular, research will be done on (1) band structure and                    
              localized impurity modes associated with the propagation of                    
              electromagnetic waves in two- and three-dimensional periodic                   
              dielectric media; (2) transverse Anderson localization effects                 
              associated with the propagation of electromagnetic waves in random             
              dielectric media; and, (3) localization effects in the heat                    
              conductivity associated with the propagation of acoustic waves in              
              amorphous materials.  The band structure and impurity mode spectra             
              of periodic dielectric media are of potential importance in the                
              development of laser and solar cell technologies.  On the other                
              hand, fundamental studies of classical waves propagating in random             
              media offer the opportunity for the prediction of new Anderson                 
              localization related phenomena which do not have complications                 
              associated with self-interactions of the system excitations.

              The theoretical research will study the propagation of                         
              electromagnetic waves, such as light, through media of different               
              dimensionalities and structure.  These different media can cause               
              the light to behave in strange ways such as bunching in specific               
              regions.  Effects such as these are of fundamental interest in                 
              condensed matter physics and are also of interest to the technology            
              of photonics.
