Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This is the first year of a three-year continuing award.  The                  
              research explores the information requirements of robot tasks, for             
              automating design of sensors from the specification of a robot's               
              task, its actions, and its uncertainty in sensing and control.  The            
              sensors provide precisely the information required by the robot to             
              perform its task, despite the sensing and control uncertainties.               
              The key idea is to generate a strategy for the robot task by using             
              a backchaining planner that assumes perfect sensing while taking               
              careful account of control uncertainty.  The resulting plan                    
              indirectly specifies a sensor that tells the robot when to execute             
              which action.  The sensor need not provide perfect information, but            
              only that information required for the plan to function correctly.             
              In contrast with traditional approaches to task planning which use             
              a bottom-up design that focuses on the sensor characteristics and              
              accommodates them, this approach is driven from the top, by                    
              questions such as "given a task, what sensor characteristics and               
              tolerances are needed," and "how does sensing depend on action."               
              The research investigates special purpose sensors for several                  
              simple assembly tasks, including multiple-peg-in-hole assembly,                
              parts identification, parts orienting, and sorting.  The ultimate              
              goal is to develop task-level planners that can translate                      
              high-level task specifications into low-level robot commands.
