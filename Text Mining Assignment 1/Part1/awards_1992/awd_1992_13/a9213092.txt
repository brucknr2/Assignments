Abstract    :
                   The workshop will focus on teaching design skills.  It will               
              bring together a small group of experienced design teachers,                   
              practitioners, and researchers to examine design teaching in a                 
              range of disciplines, such as engineering, architecture, and                   
              computer science.                                                              
                   The goals are to clarify how specific aspects of design                   
              teaching are cross-disciplinary or domain-specific and to gather               
              techniques, tools, and materials that can be used in a                         
              multidisciplinary undergraduate course in design skills.
