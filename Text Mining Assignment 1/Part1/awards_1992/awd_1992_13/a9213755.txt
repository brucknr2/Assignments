Abstract    :
              Electronic structure calculations grounded in the Hohenberg-Kohn-              
              Sham density functional theory predict what atoms, molecules, and              
              solids can exist, and with what properties.  The accuracy of these             
              predictions depends on the accuracy of the functionals or rules                
              used to construct the energy from the electron density.  Goals of              
              this theoretical research are: (1) to develop, from first                      
              principles, more accurate exchange correlation and kinetic energy              
              functionals of the local spin density and generalized gradient                 
              types; (2) to apply generalized gradient approximations in                     
              calculations of measurable proerties such as the electron spin                 
              density at the nucleus of an atom or the energy of a metallic                  
              surface; (3) to understand the capabilities and limitations of                 
              these approximations in light of radical nonlocality of the exact              
              exchange correlation potential; (4) to refine and test fully                   
              nonlocal functionals such as the self-interaction correction or the            
              weighted density approximation; (5) to construct local                         
              pseudopotentials describing effective interactions between valence             
              electrons and ionic cores in metals using only the equilibrium                 
              density, the valence, and a "smoothness" condition; (6) to study               
              size effects in metals.

              Theoretical research will be conducted on the foundations of one of            
              the major techniques currently used to determine the properties of             
              atoms, molecules and solids.  The results of this work will                    
              reinforce the fundamentals of density functional theory and provide            
              guidance for new directions for its computational implementation.
