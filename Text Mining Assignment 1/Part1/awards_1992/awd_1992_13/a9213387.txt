Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              A central issue in developmental neuroscience is the identification            
              of molecules that guide nerve cells during axonal growth and final             
              target recognition.  Molecular genetics will be used to identify               
              genes in the fruit fly that code for cell-surface labels or other              
              molecules which neurons use to recognize specific pathways and                 
              synaptic partners.  The subjects are eight large neurons mediating             
              the escape response in the fruit fly.  These neurons have been                 
              extensively characterized physiologically and anatomically.  Mutant            
              flies have been developed in which specific connections between                
              these neurons are disrupted.  The mutation, Pas, blocks a key link             
              in the escape response.  This gene has been cloned.  Some mutations            
              in the region of the Pas gene are lethal, while others cause only              
              neurological defects.  The relationship between these two phenomena            
              will be studied.  Two transcripts have been found in the Pas                   
              region.  A molecular analysis of these transcripts will be                     
              undertaken to determine the basis for lethal or neurological                   
              defective development.  These studies promise to provide                       
              information generally relevant to the molecular mechanisms                     
              regulating the development of synaptic specificity.
