Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This project involves the dissertation research in Africa of an                
              anthropology graduate student from the University of                           
              Pennsylvania.  The project will study the relation of social                   
              structure to craft organization in two pottery cooperatives in                 
              the Ivory Coast.  Using a combination of ethnographic methods                  
              including participant observation and structured life-history                  
              interviews, the student will examine the relationships among                   
              economic and social factors such as inheritance and labor                      
              processes as well as the tradeoffs between subsistence and cash                
              activities.                                                                    
                                                                                             
              This research is important because cooperatives, especially craft              
              cooperatives, have long been promoted as a means of African                    
              development and have been a highly visible failure.  This careful              
              case study will reveal the reasons for differential success and                
              failure and will serve as a resource for planners and scholars                 
              studying the role of craft production in development.
