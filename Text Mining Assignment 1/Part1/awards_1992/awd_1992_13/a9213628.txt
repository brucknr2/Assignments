Abstract    :
              This study develops and analyzes comparative data on change in the             
              uses of computing by a representative selection of greater New York            
              private sector firms.  Returning to the sample studied by Attewell             
              and Rule in the late 1980's, the proposed research will document               
              changes in computing use and in other basic features of the                    
              original 184 establishments.  Detailed telephone interviews will be            
              carried out with as many of these establishments as possible, and              
              site interviews will take place in a sub-sample of about fifty.                
              Resulting analyses should illuminate the form and extent of change             
              in computing activities over roughly seven intervening years, as               
              well as the determinants of such change.
