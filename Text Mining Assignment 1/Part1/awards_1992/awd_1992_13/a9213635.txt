Abstract    :
              In this project in the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program                 
              Dr. Kenneth R. Leopold will use tunable, high-resolution                       
              tunable far infrared spectroscopy to study 1) potential energy                 
              surfaces and internal dynamics of weakly-bound complexes and                   
              2) the dynamics of intramolecular proton transfer reactions.                   
              Work in the first area will focus on systems with multiple                     
              secondary potential minima and large amplitude vibrations.                     
              These are important as models for more general chemical                        
              complexes which exhibit competitive binding sites.  In the                     
              second area intramolecular proton transfer dynamics will be                    
              investigated for the internally hydrogen bonded molecule                       
              molecule malonaldehyde.  In particular, the tunneling                          
              splittings produced by the proton motion will be examined in                   
              the presence of a quantum of vibrational excitation in several                 
              of the skeletal vibrational modes of the molecule.                             
              %%%                                                                            
              Hydrogen bonding and other weak intermolecular interactions are                
              important because they can steer the course of many chemical                   
              reactions of vital technological and biological importance. It                 
              is therefore important to understand these interactions at a                   
              fundamental level. Dr. Leopold will add to this understanding                  
              by probing the strength and nature of intermoecular                            
              interactions using a special, high resolution infrared                         
              spectrometer constructed in his laboratory.
