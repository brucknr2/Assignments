Abstract    :
              Theoretical research will be conducted on high temperature                     
              superconductors (copper oxides).  This work is motivated by the                
              close proximity, at low doping concentrations of oxygen, of the                
              superconducting phase to the antiferromagnetic phase.  Our recently            
              developed semiclassical expansion of a model in this regime allows             
              for a controlled study of the slightly doped antiferromagnet.  The             
              comparison for these single hole results to numerical simulations              
              and experiments is encouraging.  The many hole problem has not been            
              studied and the proposed projects will clarify the effects of                  
              finite doping on the magnetic order and on the evolution from an               
              antiferromagnetic insulator to a high temperature superconductor.              
              %%%                                                                            
              This project will theoretically study one model for high                       
              temperature superconductors and its behavior before becoming                   
              superconducting.  Thus, the effect of oxygen doping on the magnetic            
              properties prior to becoming superconducting and the influence of              
              doping on superconductivity will be studied.  This problem is one              
              of the foremost ones in condensed matter physics and materials                 
              science.
