Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                Matching funds are provided in this award for Dr. Bruce Hammer              
              to extend the use of NMR imaging techniques to the measurement of              
              perfusive flow through and intersticial flow about the beads in a              
              packed HPLC column.  Application of transverse magnetic field                  
              gradients followed by gradient reversal will allow flowing                     
              molecules to be labeled and their displacement with time followed.             
              Information about the flow field will be shared with corporate                 
              scientists at 3M to improve HPLC packing materials and their use               
              in bioseparations.                                                             
                                                                                             
                                                                                             
                 Separation and purification of pharmaceutical drugs constitutes             
              a large portion of the costs in their manufacture.  Improvements               
              in powerful purification techniques like HPLC should lower costs               
              and improve the quality of medications.
