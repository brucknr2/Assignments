Abstract    :
              This award will provide partial support for the Chemistry                      
              Career Planning Workshop for Underrepresented Minority Students                
              which will be held at Purdue University, June 12-14, 1992. The                 
              objective of the workshop is to bring minority students from                   
              throughout the U.S. together with about 25 very successful                     
              minority mentors from industry, academia and government, in                    
              order to acquaint the students with the opportunities created                  
              by obtaining a Ph.D degree in Chemistry.  The workshop will                    
              also afford the students to meet with graduate students in the                 
              Chemistry Department at Purdue and to see state-of-the-art                     
              research instrumentation in use.
