Abstract    :
                   The objective of this project is to analyze operations                    
              involving aircraft fuselage subassemblies, frames and doors.                   
              Alternative methods to optimize production operations will be                  
              investigated.  Computer models using available software packages               
              will be developed.  Computer models will be used to optimize the               
              performance of fuselage manufacturing operations.  Opportunities               
              to optimize existing work methods through setup time reductions and            
              process improvements will also be investigated.                                
                   The internship is expected to lead to several manufacturing               
              projects and generate  cooperative opportunities for students.
