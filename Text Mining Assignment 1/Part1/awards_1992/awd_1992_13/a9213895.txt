Abstract    :
              The Principal Investigators (PIs)                                              
              propose to study the role of protein                                           
              folding chaperones in the secretion                                            
              of foreign proteins from yeast.                                                
              There is evidence in the literature                                            
              that protein folding in the lumen of                                           
              the endoplasmic reticulum may be the                                           
              rate-limiting step in the overall                                              
              process of secretion, and that

              regulated promoters, and to

              foreign protein secretion.  The PIs                                            
              also plan to isolate novel
