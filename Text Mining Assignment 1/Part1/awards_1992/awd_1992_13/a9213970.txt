Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The primary objective of this project is to search for sites                   
              containing primate fossils from the middle Tertiary in South                   
              America.  There has long been debate as to the path by which the               
              higher primates appeared in the Old and New World.  While there                
              have been significant discoveries in the Old World, knowledge of               
              early higher primate evolution in the Americas is scant.  A                    
              principle question that remains to be answered is whether prosimian            
              grade primates evolved into a monkey grade independently in the New            
              and Old Worlds or whether this occurred once.  In the latter case              
              the last common ancestor of the two would have already have been               
              monkey.                                                                        
                                                                                             
              The investigators have identified geological deposits in Bolivia               
              which show promise of bearing fossils from this time period.  With             
              the assistance of the Bolivian Geological Survey they will search              
              for fossils from this time period.
