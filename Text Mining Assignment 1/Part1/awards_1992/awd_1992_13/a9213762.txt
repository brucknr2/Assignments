Abstract    :
                   Aspects of cavity QED related to the quantum measurement                  
              process and the interface between quantum and classical                        
              physics are studied.  The studies include the generation and                   
              detection of macroscopically separated quantum states                          
              (Schroedinger cats), cotangent states of the electromagnetic                   
              field and on new mechanisms combining cavity QED effects with                  
              the mechanical manipulation of atomic trajectories by light.                   
              Two of the most exciting subfields of quantum optics, cavity                   
              QED and atom optics will merge and should enable new ground to                 
              be broken in the study of fundamental questions in light-                      
              matter interactions.
