Abstract    :
              This project will be performed at the Ford Wixom                               
              Assembly Plant and Danou Technical Center.  The                                
              objective is to propose, evaluate and analyze                                  
              diagnostic testing strategies for advanced vehicle                             
              electronic systems.  The recently developed theory                             
              of discrete event systems will be used.  The study                             
              will result in increased efficiency during the                                 
              assembly process, reduced costs of service and                                 
              maintenance, and the ability to meet increasingly                              
              stringent environmental regulations.
