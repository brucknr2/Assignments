Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  To date, many analyses of national policies treat those                   
              policies as evolving out of the distinctive needs, conflicts, and              
              histories of national societies.  Over the past two decades,                   
              sociological theorists have moved towards an emphasis on the                   
              economic interdependency of states and the functioning of states               
              as part of a world system.  In this context, diffusion processes,              
              that is, the transmission of policies across social actors, can                
              be  seen as central to the way national policy making is                       
              constrained and informed by a larger social, political, and                    
              cultural environment.  This proposal will use event-history                    
              analyses of national policies in environmental protection to                   
              investigate the world-wide adoption of national policies.  These               
              models will permit the estimation of effects related to the                    
              susceptibility of the potential adopter to external influences,                
              the infectiousness of external sources of diffusion, and the                   
              social proximity of the potential adopter to the source of                     
              diffusion.                                                                     
                                                                                             
                   This project will contribute to our understanding of the                  
              timing of the adoption of national policies based on                           
              understandings of (1) the ways that relationships among nation-                
              states as well as internal forces speed or retard diffusion of                 
              policies, (2) the ways that international organizations help                   
              produce similar policies, and (3) the ways that the timing and                 
              characteristics of policies affect the rates of diffusion.  This               
              project will make an important social scientific contribution to               
              our understanding of the human dimensions of global environmental              
              change, and it should provide us with new insights into the                    
              potential uses and limitations of event-history analyses.
