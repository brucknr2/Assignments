Abstract    :
              This award provides continued support for the Duke                             
              University Primate Center (DUPC). DUPC houses the largest                      
              and most diverse collection of prosimian primates in he                        
              world. The DUPC operates as a research resource providing                      
              animals, tissues and blood samples to scientists in diverse                    
              areas of research                                                              
              including animal behavior, anatomy, morphology, physiology,                    
              ecology, developmental biology, taxonomy, evolution,                           
              biodiversity, and conservation biology.  In the last few                       
              years, research on prosimians has increased in scope,                          
              intensity and sophistication.  The DUPC serves an important                    
              function for the research community by maintaining a colony                    
              of diverse prosimian primates and providing the research                       
              material as well as facilities.  Duke University has                           
              committed considerable resources for the DUPC, and NSF                         
              provides funds necessary for the DUPC to function as a                         
              community resource for national and international                              
              researchers.
