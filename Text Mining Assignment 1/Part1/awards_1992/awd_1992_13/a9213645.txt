Abstract    :
                   The objective of this faculty internship is to investigate                
              research issues related to productivity and quality improvement                
              through ergonomics initiatives.  Research activities include the               
              integration of ergonomics into engineering design, development of              
              an information system for accurate reporting and documentation of              
              ergonomics hazards, and testing of the utility of symptoms surveys             
              and perceived comfort ratings in identifying ergonomics hazards.               
                   The research will be conducted with two industrial co-                    
              investigators with the ultimate goal of integrating the quality                
              program and ergonomics program within the sponsoring industrial                
              site.  Analysis of human interface points in advanced manufacturing            
              departments are expected to provide generic guidelines applicable              
              to other industrial settings.
