Abstract    :
              9213787  Orville         This proposal's objective is to initiate a lightning
              research  program at Texas A&M University.  The PIs will investigate the 
              meteorological and physical characteristics of cloud-to-ground  lightning and
              intracloud lightning in convective systems.  This  includes squall lines,
              mesoscale convective systems, and cold and  warm fronts.  Using the lightning
              and Doppler radar data, they will  focus on the location of negative and
              positive cloud-to-ground  flashes, their peak currents, and their multiplicity,
              with respect  to a convective systems' (1) maximum reflectivity area (dBZ) as a
               function of height and time, (2) updraft and downdraft cores, (3)  mesocyclone
              strength as determined from the vorticity associated  with the horizontal
              shear, and (4) radial divergence of the wind as  a function of height and time.
