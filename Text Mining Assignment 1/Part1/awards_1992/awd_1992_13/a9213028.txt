Abstract    :
              A Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) spectrometer system which                  
              will be used to support several research programs in                           
              combustion engineering will be purchased with this equipment                   
              grant.  These projects will include: (1) Investigation of the                  
              mechanism and kinetics of formation of sulfur gases and                        
              hydrogen chloride during combustion and gasification of spent                  
              pulping liquors and other biomass-containing process wastes;                   
              (2) Studies of the mechanism and kinetics of formation of                      
              nitrogen oxides during combustion of spent pulping liquors and                 
              other biomass-containing process wastes; and, (3)                              
              Investigation of the kinetics of gasification of biomass                       
              materials including spent pulping liquors, biomass-containing                  
              process wastes, wheat straw, and wood waste, including studies                 
              of the formation of such acid gases as sulfur dioxide and                      
              hydrogen chloride during gasification.                                         
                                                                                             
              The research program in combustion and gasification is                         
              directed at minimizing the environmental impact of combustion                  
              processes through in-process control and at improved energy                    
              conversion efficiency and energy recovery from low-grade non-                  
              conventional fuels and process wastes.  Thus, the program has                  
              the potential to aid in three national-need areas: reduction                   
              of air pollution, improved resource utilization, and reduction                 
              of solid and liquid waste disposal problems.
