Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Dynamic changes in the molecules that form the internal skeleton of            
              nerve cells are related to nerve cell form and function.                       
              Development of the nervous system requires that the neuronal                   
              cytoskeleton be endowed the seemingly incompatible properties of               
              morphological stability and plasticity.  Morphological stability is            
              critical for maintenance and proper function of neuronal circuits,             
              while plasticity is required for cell growth and remodeling of cell            
              processes during response to environmental stimuli or injury.  The             
              assembly or disassembly kinetics of microtubules will be studied               
              using the powerful techniques of microinjection, laser-induced                 
              photobleaching and photoactivation.  Previous studies using these              
              techniques have led to controversial results regarding the site of             
              assembly of microtubules in neuronal processes.  Novel experiments             
              will be performed to resolve this controversy and to evaluate the              
              potentially powerful photobleaching laser technology as applied to             
              living nerve cells.  This award will provide the PI with the laser             
              equipment necessary for these experiments.
