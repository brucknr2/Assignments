Abstract    :
                   The Larch Workshop is intended to bring together international            
              users and developers of the Larch family of specification languages            
              and tools.  The three-day workshop, organized by Professors Ursula             
              Martin (European coordinator) and Jeannette WIng (US coordinator) will         
              be the first meeting ever of those who have over the past 11 years             
              designed the Larch languages, built tool support for them, and used            
              them to specify and reason about software and hardware systems.  The           
              group includes users and developers of the Larch Prover (LP), one of           
              the Larch tools that distinguishes Larch from its competitors in               
              formal methods.                                                                
                   The invited participants include researchers from the United              
              States and Europe who are active in the area of formal specification           
              and verification.  The workshop will be held at Endicott House,                
              approximately 15 miles from MIT, in Dedham, Massachusetts.  The award          
              is pursuant to the NSF-ESPRIT agreement.
