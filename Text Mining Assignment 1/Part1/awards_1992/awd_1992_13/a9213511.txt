Abstract    :
              The principal objective of this three-year project is to conduct               
              a participant observation study that examines the changing                     
              identities of undergraduate engineering students as they                       
              transform themselves from novice freshmen into graduating seniors              
              prepared for employment or advanced training.  The major product               
              is a book length manuscript co-authored by the three members of                
              the research team.  With guidance from a panel of consulting                   
              advisers, the authors will provide a step-by-step account of how               
              engineering students understand and experience their education as              
              a sequence of value choices and judgments to be made as they move              
              through their engineering curricula.  A guiding hypothesis is                  
              that the high value engineering curricula place on the calculus                
              based engineering sciences as the foundation of engineering                    
              problem solving is linked to the establishment of other social                 
              dimensions of engineering identities, and to under-representation              
              of women and minority students.  A second objective is to make                 
              available to other researchers approximately 2,500 pages of                    
              indexed transcriptions from taped focus group meetings and                     
              interviews with undergraduate engineering students at a large                  
              land-grant university.  Finally, by providing a longitudinal                   
              account built upon data from transcriptions, participant                       
              observation, surveys, and document collection, this study will                 
              make a unique and much-needed contribution to our analytic                     
              understanding of the character and problems of engineering                     
              curricula.
