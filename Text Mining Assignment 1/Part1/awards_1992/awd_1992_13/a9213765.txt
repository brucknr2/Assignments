Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The molecular events that culminate in exocytosis are unknown                  
              although recent work has suggested that small G-proteins regulate              
              the movement and targeting of membranous structures and processes              
              (membrane-trafficking) including exocytosis.  Among the distinctive            
              modifications of G-proteins that regulate cyclic interactions of               
              these proteins with cellular membranes are polyisoprenylation and              
              fatty-acylation of C-terminal Cys residues.  Certain snake venom               
              phospholipase A2 enzymes are extremely potent neurotoxins at the               
              presynaptic terminal and block neurotransmitter release without                
              structural damage to the nerve ending.  The hypothesis to be tested            
              is that these venoms may act to modify the small G-proteins and                
              thereby block the exocytotic process of neurotransmitter release.              
              This research has the potential for increasing understanding of                
              exocytosis and providing molecular tools for the study of                      
              neurotransmission and exocytosis in a wide variety of cells and                
              tissues.
