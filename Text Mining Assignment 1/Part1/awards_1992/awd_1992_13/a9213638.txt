Abstract    :
                   This award provides one-half the funds necessary for the                  
              acquisition of equipment to automate the sample preparation at the             
              University of Arizona Accelerator Mass Spectrometry (AMS) facility.            
              The University of Arizona is committed to providing the remaining              
              funds needed.                                                                  
                   The University of Arizona AMS facility is the principal U.S.              
              laboratory for the analysis of radiocarbon at very low                         
              concentration or in very small samples available to the research               
              community in the geosciences, anthropology, and archaeology. The               
              equipment upgrade is intended to increase the capability of the                
              facility to analyze samples from 1500 per year (current capacity)              
              to approximately 2500 per year.
