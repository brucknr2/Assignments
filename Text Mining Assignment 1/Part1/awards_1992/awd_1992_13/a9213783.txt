Abstract    :
              This is a project to study adaptation of a biosensor                           
              electrode system capable of virus detection within a few                       
              hours to the detection of the Human Immunodeficiency Virus                     
              (HIV) in fluids of environmental significance.  The                            
              concept is based upon successful application of an                             
              electrode to the detection of toxic chemicals by detection                     
              of changes in the respiratory activity of a biofilm of                         
              appropriate host cells mounted on the surface of a                             
              galvanic cell oxygen electrode.  Objectives of this                            
              project include assessment of the feasibility of using the                     
              biofilm electrode for detection of the HIV in comparison                       
              with conventional tissue procedures and the "polymerase                        
              chain reaction," and to determine the potential of an                          
              electrode-based system for determining the survival                            
              characteristics of the HIV in environmental media.  The                        
              investigator will be coordinating this research with that                      
              being conducted under NSF Grant No. 9018567 by Dr. Rasul                       
              Chaudhry at Oakland University.                                                
                                                                                             
              The proposal leading to this award was submitted to NSF                        
              under conditions outlined in NSF 89-85, Small Grants for                       
              Exploratory Research (SGER).  While there is no present                        
              indication that the environmental media have a role in                         
              spreading the virus from infected to non-infected                              
              individuals, the potential does exist.  The HIV has been                       
              shown to survive for significant periods of time in the                        
              environment.  Results of this research may provide the                         
              basis for an analytical technique that could be used in                        
              conduct of research on the survival characteristics of the                     
              HIV when subjected to environmental stress as occurs in                        
              collection systems, treatment processes and systems for                        
              management of wastes infected with the HIV.
