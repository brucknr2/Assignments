Abstract    :
                   Professor Bernstein and his associates will embark upon a                 
              wide-ranging study of matter-wave interference and investigate                 
              ways in which matter waves can be reflected, split and                         
              manipulated.  Matter-wave optics will complement familiar light                
              optics and is a critical component in manipulating microscopic                 
              particles.
