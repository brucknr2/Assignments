Abstract    :
                   The objective of this research program is to use multiphoton              
              excitation to study the spectroscopy, ionization and dissociation              
              dynamics of small molecules.  Resonantly enhanced multiphoton                  
              ionization (REMPI) will be used to study the spectroscopy of                   
              excited molecular states that cannot be reached by single photon               
              excitation.
