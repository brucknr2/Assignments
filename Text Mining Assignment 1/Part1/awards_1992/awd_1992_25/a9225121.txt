                  ABSTRACT see G:\crb93.jpr\awards   Under a previous award, plantations
              dominated by mixtures of fast growing trees were established in degraded
              tropical forests sites in Costa Rica. Experiments were run to compare resource
              use and site quality maintenance, both key aspects of restoration of ecosystem
              function, under different treatment regimes. In this bridging grant, resources
              will be used to maintain data collection and site monitoring activities.   The
              results of this long term research project should lead to sound understanding
              of the ecological underpinning of ecosystem function, and to the design of
              sustainable land use systems so badly needed to complete the conservation
              equation for tropical rain forests.
