Abstract    :
                   In Nicaragua a relatively unique situation exists in which the            
              freshwater fish resource is being underutilized as a protein                   
              source.  Exceptional opportunities are present to develop this                 
              resource and increase the protein consumption of the rural inland              
              population of Nicaragua.  However the recent introduction of                   
              African tilapia threatens the entire natural ecosystem where they              
              appear to be spreading and dominating the local cichlid fauna.                 
              Their presence could collapse the fisheries valued at over 10                  
              million dollars.  This study will examine the expansion of the                 
              introduced African tilapia in Lake Nicaragua and continue long-term            
              studies on the ecology, reproductive biology and recruitment of                
              Nicaraguan cichlid fishes.                                                     
              %%%                                                                            
              Numerous studies have documented the disappearance of one or more              
              species from bodies of water following exotic introductions.  These            
              studies have taken place after the species have been eliminated and            
              the precise mechanisms or causes for elimination remain                        
              hypothetical.  This study will examine, document, and understand               
              the actual process of fish invasions before native species, many               
              underscribed, disappear.  The results will be used to coordinate               
              management of the cichlid fish resource with the goal of                       
              maintaining the genetic diversity of the fisheries while at the                
              same time maximizing the sustainable economic return to the people             
              of Nicaragua.
