              9225062 Pinedo          This research focuses on several classes of scheduling
              problems which arise in the design, development and implementation of
              scheduling systems currently being used in manufacturing.  the project has both
              theoretical and applied aspects.  One class of problems concerns multi
              objective scheduling.  In the real world a scheduler usually has a number of
              objectives to take into account.  In order to develop a schedule he has to know
              the trade offs between the various objectives.  The research aims at developing
              algorithms for solving such multi objective problems as well as developing
              procedures for parametric analyses.  A second class of scheduling problems
              concerns problems with machine availability constraints.  In practice, machines
              are usually not continuously available for the jobs to be scheduled.  At times
              they may not be available because of preventive maintenance or other reasons. 
              The theoretical side of the research aims at developing scheduling algorithms
              which take machine availability constraints into account.          The project
              focuses on a number of issue on the applied side as well.  A prototype
              scheduling systems has been developed at Columbia University during the last
              three years.  A number of companies have a version of this system (including
              the source code) in their laboratories.
