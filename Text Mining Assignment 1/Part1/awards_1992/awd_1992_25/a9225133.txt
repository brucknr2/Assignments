Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              A multifacted attack on some of the basic problems of                          
              distant radio galaxies will be carried out under this                          
              research program.  Questions to be examined include                            
              determination of the earliest times when active galaxies are                   
              formed, the maximum power radiated by active galaxies, and                     
              the detailed physical morphologies of the most distant (and                    
              presumably the youngest) galaxies.  Some of the                                
              investigations will make use of the 10-meter Keck reflector                    
              at Mauna Kea, Hawaii.                                                          
                                                                                             
              The Principal Investigator is regarded as a world leader in                    
              this research area.
