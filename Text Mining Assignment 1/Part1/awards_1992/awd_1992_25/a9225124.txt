Abstract    :
               The goal of this project is to define a general formal model for  reasoning
              about real-time and distributed systems, and to  establish its value  by using
              it for a variety of purposes.  Many  models have been proposed  for such
              systems; this project  is unique in that it attempts to define a single  model
              that can  be used for many different purposes.  The uses for such a model 
              include: (1) proving fundamental results about the capabilities of real-time 
              and distributed systems.  These include upper and lower bound  complexity 
              results (for time, space and communication complexity)  and impossibility 
              results: (2) describing real systems, using appropriate programming  languages;
               (3) specifying allowable system behavior; (4) verifying (by hand or by
              machine)  the correctness of algorithms  and systems.  There are different
              styles of  verification, of  which assertional, algebraic and temporal logic
              methods are  probably the most significant; and (5) analyzing system
              performance.  Traditionally, research in each of these areas has been based on 
              a semantic  model designed specifically for that area.  In  contrast, this
              project aims to  conduct work in these areas in  terms of a common model.   
              The project   focuses particularly on real-time and other timing-based systems
              (e.g.,  communication systems and real-time process  control systems).
