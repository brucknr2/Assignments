Abstract    :
                   This award supports the research of Professor Rodger to work              
              in combinatorics.  Professor Rodger will continue his                          
              investigations into the area of graph decompositions and                       
              embeddings of partial graph-designs.  Professor Rodger will also               
              continue his development of a natural generalization of latin                  
              squares, which he has called patterned holes.  This concept of                 
              patterned holes has led to dramatic improvements in embeddings of              
              various partial graph designs and has led to generalizations of                
              several classical embedding theorems.                                          
                   The research is in the general area of combinatorics.                     
              Combinatorics attempts to find efficient methods to study how                  
              discrete collections can be organized.  The behavior of discrete               
              systems is extremely important to modern communications.  For                  
              example, the design of large networks, as in telephone systems,                
              and the design of algorithms in computer science all deal with                 
              discrete objects, and this makes use of combinatorial research.
