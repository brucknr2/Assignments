Abstract    :
              A large number of excellent strong ground motion and                           
              structural response accelerograms were recorded during                         
              the M 7.5 Landers earthquake of June 28, 1992, which                           
              was the largest to occur in California since 1952.  There                      
              was relatively little damage to engineered structures due                      
              to the remote location of the epicenter.  However the                          
              ground motion records obtained from this event are                             
              among the most significant measured to date, and                               
              especially the recording from a free-field instrument                          
              installed and maintained by the Southern California                            
              Edison Co. (SCE).  This instrument was located in                              
              Lucerne Valley within approximately one mile of the                            
              surface rupture, thus providing one of the closest near-                       
              field recordings of a major U.S. earthquake.  A                                
              preliminary analysis of this record shows a very                               
              pronounced long-period pulse in the displacement with                          
              an amplitude of about 120 cm.  This type of ground                             
              motion could have a serious effect on the response of                          
              large structures.                                                              
                                                                                             
              The existence of significant long-period motion in the                         
              near-field of a large earthquake has been postulated for                       
              some years and analytical models have been proposed to                         
              characterize this near-field motion.  However there has                        
              been insufficient data with which to verify either the                         
              existence or the nature of this type of motion.  The                           
              evidence of significant strongly correlated long-period                        
              motion provided by a preliminary analysis of the                               
              Lucerne Valley (SCE) record is of very great interest                          
              and concern to earthquake engineers.                                           
                                                                                             
              The objective of this project is: (1) to undertake a                           
              thorough study of the site, the instrument, and the                            
              recorded data so as to determine the accuracy of the                           
              Lucerne Valley earthquake record, (2) to develop                               
              appropriate correction algorithms for this instrument                          
              and to apply these to the measured ground motion                               
              record, and (3) to study the characteristics of the                            
              Lucerne Valley record any available comparable data to                         
              obtain a better understanding of the possible effects of                       
              near-field earthquakes on structural response.
