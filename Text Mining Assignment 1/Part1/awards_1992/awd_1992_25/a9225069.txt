Abstract    :
              Dr. Geraldine L. Richmond and other members of the Chemistry and               
              Physics Departments who are also members of the Chemical Physics               
              Institute of the University of Oregon are being supported to                   
              continue a Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) site in               
              Chemistry.  For the period 1993-5, ten undergraduate students from             
              the Chemistry and Physics Departments will spend ten weeks each                
              summer actively engaged in a variety of research projects.                     
              Projects cover the areas of physical chemistry and chemical                    
              physics.  A unique feature of this program is the interaction                  
              between students and faculty from the two departments.
