Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This is a collaborative project between C. Rogers (Tufts U.) and               
              J. Eaton (Standford U.).  A combined experimental-numerical                    
              simulation approach is proposed to displace the masuring control               
              volume of an LDV system as it were a particle in a turbulent                   
              field.  The LDV system will use an active control loop.  The                   
              fluid velocity autocorrelations in a particle-Lagrangian                       
              reference frame, and the correlations between the fluctuating                  
              velocities of the particle and the fluid at the same point, will               
              be detrmined.  The obtained data are similar to the results                    
              derived from direct numerical simulations, which currently are                 
              feasible only at turbulent flow with low Reynolds numbers.  The                
              results may be useful to calibrate various theories and                        
              numerical simulations in tow phase flows.  The conditions of the               
              experiment are simplified:  only point particles are simulated,                
              particles do not affect the flow, the testing domain is two-                   
              dimensional, the effects of particle shape and wake are                        
              considered.                                                                    
                                                                                             
              The present project may lead to significant advances in                        
              understanding and modeling disperse two-phase flow at high                     
              Reynolds numbers of interest in various industrial processes.
