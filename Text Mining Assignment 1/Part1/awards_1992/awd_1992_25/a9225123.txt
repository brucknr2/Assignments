Abstract    :
              9225123  Beck  Dr. Thomas L. Beck is supported by a grant from the Theoretical 
              and Computational Chemistry Program to perform research in the  following two
              areas:  1) computer simulations and statistical  mechanical theory of a
              tethered alkane-polar solution which is  a model for reversed phase liquid
              chromatography; and 2)  calculation of chemical potentials in quantum systems
              with  applications to solubilities.  Beck will apply a combination of  computer
              simulation methodologies such as Stationary Phase  Monte Carlo and Coherent
              State Path Integration as well as  statistical mechanical theory to these
              theoretical problems.  %%%  Polymers adsorbed or chemically bonded to surfaces
              form the  basis for several technologically and biologically important 
              processes, e.g., molecular electronics, polymer coatings, and  model membranes.
               Reverse Phase Liquid Chromatography (RPLC) is  an important chemical
              separation technique which depends on  such an interface.  Dr. Beck's research
              will help to understand  the detailed mechanism for this separation technique
              at the  molecular level.  In a second set of studies, Beck will examine  the
              fundamental theory behind the unusual quantum behavior of  of light elements at
              low temperatures.  This has important  implications with regard to the
              solubility of various atoms and  molecules in liquid helium, and the storage of
              hydrogen  isotopes in metals.  ***
