Abstract    :
              9225081  Gavin  We propose to examine the relationships among population size,
              population structure, and dispersal in determining the viability of a mammal,
              by focusing on demographic and genetic characteristics.  The northern Idaho
              ground squirrel ( Spermophilus brunneus brunneus ) will be studied.  This
              species is found in only 21 populations ( 18 extant and 3 that have gone
              extinct since 1983 ), which contain in aggregate total no more than 1,000
              individuals.  The range of population sizes and degree of isolation of
              populations of this species make it a model organism for studies of population
              viability.  Moreover, this small mammal is tractable to work with:  it can be
              trapped, marked, and observed with relative ease.  %%%  Our objectives are to
              determine 1) the role that immigration plays in maintaining population size and
              genetic variation 2) if birth, death, and dispersal, rates in small, isolated
              populations are different than this of larger, less isolated populations, and
              3) if the level of genetic variation has been maintained equally in several
              isolated populations, when all 3 situations contain approximately the same
              number of individuals.  We propose to use VORTEX, the most widely used
              simulation model for Population Viability Analysis, to evaluate the effects of
              dispersal and population structure on the viability of this rare rodent.
