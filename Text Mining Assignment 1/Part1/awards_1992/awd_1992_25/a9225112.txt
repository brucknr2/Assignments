Abstract    :
                   The research involves the continued study of the geometry of              
              manifolds of special holonomy and the theory of characteristic                 
              currents associated with a singular connection.  The techniques                
              are developed from significant progress attained in previous                   
              research concerning calibrated geometries on classes of                        
              Riemannian manifolds.
