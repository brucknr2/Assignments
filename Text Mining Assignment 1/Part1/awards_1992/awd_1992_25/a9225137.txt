Abstract    :
              Wong       Study of Collapse processes in strong electromagnetic  (EM) wave
              interactions with magnetized and unmagnetized  plasmas.  The program consists
              of:  the search for caviton  collapse generated by EM waves at the resonant
              layer as  predicted by recent theoretical treatments; the optical  imaging of
              Langmuir cavitons; the nonlinear generation of  radiation bursts by collapsing
              cavitons; the observation of  collapse in high beta plasmas in a unique
              quasi-steady-state  magnetic plasmas.  Other areas related to high power EM 
              waves which are proposed for study are:  the decay of a  strong EM wave into
              the "2wp instabilities", the nonlinear  heating and cooling rates of electrons
              by EM waves and the  production and confinement of very high density plasmas by
               solely EM fields in the absence of a static magnetic field.
