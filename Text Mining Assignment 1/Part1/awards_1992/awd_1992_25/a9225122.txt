Abstract    :
              Ten undergraduates each year for the next three years will                     
              participate in a Research Experiences for Undergraduates program               
              in the Department of Civil Engineering and Geological Sciences at              
              the University of Notre Dame.  This experience is designed to                  
              provide students with an improved understanding of research and to             
              encourage them to consider careers in research.  The research                  
              activities span the areas of expertise of the faculty in civil                 
              engineering and include projects in water resources, bioengineering            
              and pollution control, and structural mechanics.  Components of the            
              program include identification of exceptional students through                 
              nationwide recruitment with emphasis on women and minority                     
              participation; matching of student research interests with faculty;            
              close interaction of graduate students and faculty with the                    
              undergraduates to provide students with a fuller appreciation of               
              graduate study, university research, and careers in academia; an               
              intense two month research experience; mini-courses, as needed, to             
              facilitate effectiveness in the research projects; and a mini-                 
              conference for presentation of results.  The goal of the program               
              is to excite some of the best engineering students in the nation               
              about the challenges of a career in research.
