Abstract    :
              This award provides funds to the Department of Psychology at                   
              the University of California, Irvine to continue to sponsor                    
              an undergraduate research experience in Neural Plasticity                      
              and Brain Function.  The highly successful program                             
              originated with a one-week undergraduate Summer Institute                      
              that was expanded last year with NSF funding.  The eight-                      
              week summer program begins with a one-week lecture/seminar                     
              series designed to introduce the students to the field and                     
              to the research of the various faculty.  This is followed by                   
              an active research experience in faculty laboratories on a                     
              defined project tailored to the goals of students and their                    
              advisors.  Throughout this period, students continue to                        
              interact with faculty in both formal and informal meetings.                    
              At the end of the program, students present their findings                     
              to other students in the Department and to the faculty.
