Abstract    :
              The objectives of this project is                                              
              to assess, using preliminary                                                   
              estimates and data being gathered                                              
              on Hurricanes Andrew and Iniki, the                                            
              magnitudes of the wind conditions                                              
              for the two storms from an                                                     
              engineering perspective; the                                                   
              performance of some general types                                              
              of structures; the effectiveness of                                            
              local building codes and                                                       
              construction practices in the two                                              
              regions; and the consequences and                                              
              reasons for the power outages which                                            
              extended well beyond the areas of                                              
              maximum damage.  Based on these                                                
              findings, specific recommendations                                             
              will be made for reducing losses                                               
              during future storms.
