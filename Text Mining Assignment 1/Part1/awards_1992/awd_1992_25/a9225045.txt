Abstract    :
                   This REU site award supports six undergraduate researchers                
              working under the supervision of the principal investigator.  It               
              continues a tradition of summer research programs conducted every              
              year (except one) since 1977 by the principal investigator who                 
              often recruits former students to assist with the program. The                 
              quality of the work is exceptionally high, Of the forty-four                   
              students who have been through the programs, thirty-two have gone              
              to graduate school, and twelve have already earned the Ph.D.                   
              Thirty-two papers written in the program have already been                     
              published, nine are in press and a dozen or more are under review              
              and in preparation.  The principal research theme of the program               
              is discrete mathematics as reflected in problems from graph                    
              theory, combinatorics, finite groups and coloring problems.                    
                   Problems often build on work done in previous programs,                   
              through correspondence with colleagues, and by searching                       
              journals.  Each student is given an individual problem and a                   
              write-up at the end of the program is required.  Students are                  
              encouraged to present their work at various professional                       
              meetings.
