Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Description:  This project provides support for a U.S. delegation              
              to an international conference in India, the"Haldane Centenary                 
              Conference on Human Genetics, Calcutta, India, December 1992".                 
              The five days meeting will mark the birth centenary of J.B.S.                  
              Haldane with the aims of:  reviewing Haldane's contribution to                 
              the various areas of human population genetics, focusing                       
              especially on their impacts on current quantitative thinking;                  
              deliberating on recent advances in quantitative human genetics,                
              evolution, population structure and genetic epidemiology;                      
              presenting applications of recent advances in theoretical aspects              
              of human genetics; and, deliberating on some current issues                    
              concerning the interaction of genes and environment with a view                
              to delineate some thrust areas that deserve immediate scientific               
              attention of human geneticists.  The meeting, which will be held               
              at the Indian Statistical Institute (ISI) in Calcutta, is                      
              expected to be attended by scientists from the U.K., Japan, the                
              Netherland, Germany, Australia, Brazil and Canada in addition to               
              the U.S. and India.                                                            
                                                                                             
              Scope:  This activity commemorates Haldane, a pioneer in the                   
              field of human genetics who established his reputation in                      
              England, before moving to India in the later part of his life,                 
              where he continued his work at the ISI in Calcutta.  The ISI is                
              considered one of the foremost centers in the world for training               
              and research in statistics, both theoretical and applied,                      
              including biostatistics.  The conference will have the effect of               
              promoting biostatistic research in India especially in devising                
              statistical methods for analyzing molecular genetic data on human              
              populations and families.  It should increase the awarness of the              
              visiting scientists to the social structure of the endogamous                  
              populations of India, the environment they live in and the                     
              resulting spread of genes within the populations.  Initiation of               
              collaborative research proposals between Indian and scientists                 
              from outside India, especially in the quantitative aspects of                  
              human genetics, is likely to result.
