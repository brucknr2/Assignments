Abstract    :
              9225114  Savage    The cotton-top tamarin (Saguinus oedipus oedipus) is one of
              the most endangered primates in  Colombia today, with a wild population of less
              than 2,500 individuals.  Efforts to conserve  this species have focused on
              understanding the natural reproductive biology and applying  much of this
              information to hands-on education programs in local villages.  In collaboration
               with scientists from Colombia's flora and fauna protection agency (INDERENA),
              Drs.  Savage and Snowdon are conducting the first long-term interdisciplinary
              field study of this  species.  Their research integrates reproductive biology,
              social behavior, infant development,  genetic diversity, feeding ecology, and
              patterns of migration of this highly endangered  primate in its native habitat
              of northern Colombia.  Results from the research are being used  to assist in
              the long-term management of the species both in the wild and in captivity, and 
              have assisted in the development of a scientifically sound conservation program
              for the  species.
