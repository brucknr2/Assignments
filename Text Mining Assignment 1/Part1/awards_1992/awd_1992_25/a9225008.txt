Abstract    :
               Probabilistic considerations arise in the analysis of  algorithms in at least
              two ways.  (1) First, in  a randomized algorithm the outcomes of random events
              are  used to determine the progress of the algorithm.  Randomization is now a
              standard tool of the computer  scientist.  (2) A second problem area has
              instances from some  probability distribution and looks to understanding the 
              average performance of a particular algorithm, which is  often far better than
              its worst case.  Both aspects are  extremely important and this work addresses
              a number of  problems in these two areas.  In the area of randomized
              algorithms, these topics are  investigated; (a) random walks on graphs and
              their  application to problems of computing volume; (b) finding edge  disjoint
              paths in expander graphs; (c) counting problems and a  randomized dual simplex
              algorithm; (d) applications of  sphere separators in parallel algorithms; and
              (e)  randomized heuristics.  In the area of probabilistic  analysis, random
              instances of: (f) the satisfiability  problem; (g) graph matching problems; and
              (h) Hamilton  cycle and traveling salesman problems, are considered;  as well
              as (i) the study of explicit constructions for the token  distribution problem.
