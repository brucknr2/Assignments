Abstract    :
                9225072  Jain    This proposed program continues  as a renewal program, which 
              investigates ion dynamics in glasses as reflected in the  frequency dependence
              of electrical conductivity s, the  nuclear spin relaxation (NSR), and in the
              correlation  between the two.  NSR rate and s are to be measured as a  function
              of frequency and temperature.  Charge  delocalization (bonding) and its effect
              on ion movement are  to be characterized systematically.    %%%%    This
              proposed program aims to investigate and to understand  the ion movement in
              glasses.  It seeks to answer questions  such as, what is the origin of
              electrical conductivity at  moderately low temperature?, and what is exact
              nature of  chemical bond between a mobile ion and ion charge  compensation
              center or network at large?  Glass is assuming  ever-increasing importance as a
              major component of the  optical communication world.  Fundamental understanding
              of  this kind can produce information which will aid out design  of new glasses
              for new applications.    ****
