Abstract    :
              9225116  Aydin         The objective of this research is to investigate the
              radar  scattering properties of ice phase hydrometeors in order to better 
              understand and interpret centimeter and millimeter wave  polarimetric radar
              measurements of clouds and precipitation.  This  will be accomplished through
              electromagnetic scattering  computations and comparisons with experimental
              measurements.  The  polarimetric scattering properties of ice crystals such as
              plates,  columns, bullets, needles and dendrites will be evaluated at 
              millimeter wave frequencies for use in discriminating ice crystal  habits and
              estimating their ice mass content with radar.  Similar  evaluations will be
              performed for scattering from graupel and hail  at centimeter wave frequencies
              for radar detection and quantitative  estimation of hail parameters such as
              hailfall rate, liquid water  in hailfall and hailstone size.  ***
