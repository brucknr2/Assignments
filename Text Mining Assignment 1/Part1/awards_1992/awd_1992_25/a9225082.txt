Abstract    :
              9225082  Bowen  The purpose of this research is to resolve the population
              structure of three endangered marine turtles; the loggerhead (Caretta caretta),
              leatherback (Dermochelys coriacea), and olive ridley (Lepidochelys olivacea). 
              Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) sequences will be used to test the general conclusion
              that marine turtles return to nest in the vicinity of their natal beach.  If
              sea turtles nest at their natal beach, then each breeding area must be managed
              as an isolated population.  Since populations are the fundamental units of
              species management, these findings have direct applications to the conservation
              of marine turtles.  Subsequently, this framework of nesting reach data will be
              used to develop genetic tags for the resolution of migratory routes and feeding
              ground composition.  In the Pacific Ocean, genetic tags con demonstrate whether
              loggerhead turtles drowned in the drift-net fishery originate on Japanese or
              Australian nesting beaches.  %%%  This application can greatly enhance the
              scientific basis for conservation and management of feeding ground populations,
              and can demonstrate the utility of this approach for future conservation
              efforts.  Finally, these data can provide a genetic framework for the
              prioritization of population recovery programs.  --------  Program Director
