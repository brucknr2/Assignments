Abstract    :
                   This project will bring six undergraduate students to the                 
              Minnesota Supercomputer Institute in each of the summers of 1993,              
              1994 , and 1995.   The students will work on ongoing, and new                  
              research in biophysical computing and computational dynamics, and              
              in new software development efforts for scientific computing and               
              graphics support for such research.
