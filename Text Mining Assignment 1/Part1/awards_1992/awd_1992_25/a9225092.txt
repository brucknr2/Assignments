Abstract    :
                   The topic of this conference is on numerical linear algebra,              
              and area of computational mathematics that has wide and important              
              applications in many fields of science and engineering.  The                   
              reason is quite simple: when simulating physical laws on a                     
              digital computer, the physical model is reduced to an algebraic                
              model which the computer then manipulate and solve to provide an               
              approximation to the physical solution.  In models with long                   
              range couplings, e.g. molecular dynamics and the flow around an                
              airplane, the numerical solutions of this algebraic model is the               
              most time consuming part of computation.  Thus, numerical linear               
              algebra lies at the critical juncture between the science and the              
              computer within the field of scientific computing.                             
                   The Householder Symposium is widely recognized as the                     
              premier conference in the field of numerical linear algebra.  it               
              has been held once every 3 years since the 50's with the venue                 
              alternating between North America and Europe.  It draws the best               
              people in the field from all over the world.  The location is                  
              usually in a secluded retreat, away from urban distractions, to                
              promote an intimate environment conducive to exchange of ideas.                
              This year the venue is at the UCLA Lake Arrowhead Conference                   
              Center near Los Angeles, a first class conference center, with                 
              excellent facilities and yet offers attractive rates for the                   
              participants.  We think it fits the tradition of this conference               
              series perfectly.  The date is set at June 13-18,1993.
