Abstract    :
              Theoretical research will explore the physical properties of                   
              strongly interacting many-electron systems.  The problems of                   
              superconductivity near a metal-insulator transition and the                    
              competition between various types of correlations will be studied.             
              A common feature of these problems is the need for non-perturbative            
              procedures such as numerical simulation or infinite-order                      
              diagrammatic approximations.  The research aims at combining                   
              numerical simulations and analytic many-body techniques with the               
              goal of providing quantitative results as well as physical                     
              understanding of strongly correlated electron materials.

              The research will combine sophisticated numerical techniques with              
              advanced analytical ones to address the underlying physics of                  
              strongly interacting electron systems such as are found in high                
              temperature superconductors.  The group of the principal                       
              investigator is one of the leading ones in the world for                       
              computational physics.
