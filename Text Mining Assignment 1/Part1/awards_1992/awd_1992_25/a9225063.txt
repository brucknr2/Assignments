Abstract    :
                   This award support the research of Ronald L. Lipsman and                  
              Jonathan M. Rosenberg.  In general, the scholars will continue                 
              their respective work in group representation theory, analysis on              
              homogeneous spaces and algebraic index theory.  Lipsman will                   
              study the spectra and multiplicities of symmetric spaces and                   
              other homogeneous spaces.  Rosenberg will use operator algebras                
              to study index theory and geometry on manifolds and similar                    
              spaces.                                                                        
                   This research is in the general area of modern analysis                   
              where spaces of functions and operators on those spaces are                    
              examined to achieve both geometric and analytic insights.
