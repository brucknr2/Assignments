Abstract    :
              9225080  Williams  This project will apply a range of modern surface science 
              techniques to investigate the effects of applied electrical  currents on the
              surface migration of atoms on metal surfaces.  The  phenomenon is known as
              surface electromigration (EM).   Interestingly, EM on surfaces is rather poorly
              understood, though  it is considered to potentially be of substantial
              technological  interest.  In the past it has been studied, but not in depth,
              with  modern surface structure tools.  Surface mass transport will be 
              investigated experimentally by studying the changes of step  structure under an
              applied electrical current using low-energy  electron microscopy.  %%%  This
              project will investigate how surface atoms move or do not move  under the
              influence of an applied electric field.  The changes in  surface morphology
              will be followed with a new surface microscope  that allows real-time data
              collection of surface structure images.   This is a low-energy electron
              microscope.  The phenomenon of  surface electromigration is surprisingly poorly
              understood.  It has  been studied for many years, but not with the modern
              techniques of  this project.  The objective is to obtain definitive data about 
              surface electromigration, which is acknowledged to be potentially  of great
              technological significance, particularly in the  microelectronics industry.
