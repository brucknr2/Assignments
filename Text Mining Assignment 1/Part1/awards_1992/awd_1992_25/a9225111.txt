Abstract    :
                Based on a temporal model of relativistic space-time, the  expression of
              distributed system behavior is studied in order to  permit partial automation
              of the process of checking requirements  and specifications, analyzing
              debugging information, and  verification for concurrent and distributed
              systems.  The  temporal approach being studied combines relativity, to allow 
              expression of true concurrency, and interval algebra, to allow  representation
              at various levels of abstraction.  The research  exploits both a general
              temporal representation, and an efficient   constraint propagation 
              implementation of a reasoning technique to achieve practical  applications of
              the theoretical model.    A prototype, minimally intrusive debugging tool,
              FORESEE,   can compare actual and expected program behavior, flagging 
              inconsistencies.  The project extends the expressiveness of  the method, seeks
              further efficiencies in the representation, and  studies the effects of the
              incompleteness of the constraint  propagation algorithm.
