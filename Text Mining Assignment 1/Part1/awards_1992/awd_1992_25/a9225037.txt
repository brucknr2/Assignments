Abstract    :
              This project will investigate automated deduction and logic                    
              programming based on some recent developments in Multiple-                     
              Valued Annotated Logics.  These logics have been advocated as                  
              a way to a uniform formalization of automated reasoning                        
              systems that often have to perform reasoning tasks which                       
              classical logics cannot handle naturally.  These logics have                   
              been used as tools to explore areas such as reasoning with                     
              uncertainty, temporal reasoning, as well as reasoning with                     
              inconsistent information.                                                      
                                                                                             
              This research will examine frameworks for automated deduction                  
              in Annotated Logics.  The adaptation of a resolution proof                     
              procedure will be studied for another class of Multiple-Valued                 
              Logics, call Signed Formulas to perform automated reasoning in                 
              Annotated Logics.  Based on this study, a unifying proof                       
              theoretic framework will be developed for the various classes                  
              of Annotated Logics.  The question of efficiency and control                   
              strategies for reducing the search space of the inference                      
              rules will be investigated, and a prototype system based on                    
              the theoretical results will be implemented.
