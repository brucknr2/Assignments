Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This project will investigate, through people's narratives                     
              and life histories, how AIDS patients' interpretations of                      
              their condition relates to factors facilitating coping, such                   
              as seeking social support and initiating self-treatment.                       
              Key aspects of interpretation examined include                                 
              accountability (explaining the cause of infections and                         
              whether one is to blame for it) and constructs of community                    
              (relating one's self to other HIV+ individuals).                               
              Indianapolis' social and political conservatism and absence                    
              of a politically powerful gay community heighten the                           
              homophobia and stigma associated with AIDS, making it more                     
              typical of  experiences of AIDS patients outside the                           
              epidemic's epicenters.  This study will contribute to                          
              cultural anthropology by demonstrating how discourses link                     
              individuals with powerful institutional domains.  It will                      
              contribute to American ethnography by exploring how people                     
              use "negative" and "positive" aspects of community in                          
              constructing identities.  Lastly, it will contribute to AIDS                   
              research and the medical community by connecting "ways of                      
              speaking" about HIV infection and strategies and choices for                   
              living with it.
