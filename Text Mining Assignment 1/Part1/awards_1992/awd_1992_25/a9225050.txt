Abstract    :
              This is a request for funds to help support a conference (titled               
              above) to be held June 20-25, 1993 at Vermont Academy, Saxtons                 
              River, VT.  It is a biennial conference, initiated in 1989,  which             
              is sponsored and partially supported by the Federation of the                  
              American Societies of Experimental Biology.  The focus of the                  
              conference is on the mechanisms of intracellular protein                       
              degradation with an emphasis on the ubiquitin-dependent proteolytic            
              pathway.  Ubiquitin is a small, highly conserved eukaryotic                    
              protein.  It functions in protein breakdown by becoming covalently             
              linked to other proteins and serves as a reusable recognition                  
              signal for proteolysis.  Specific sessions will include the                    
              biochemistry, molecular biology and genetics of the ubiquitin                  
              system, targets and functions of the ubiquitin pathway, non-                   
              ubiquitin proteolytic systems in eucaryotic and in procaryotic                 
              cells, recognition signals for protein breakdown, the proteasome,              
              proteolysis and antigen presentation enzymology and regulation of              
              protein breakdown in prokaryotes, and protein degradation in                   
              organelles.
