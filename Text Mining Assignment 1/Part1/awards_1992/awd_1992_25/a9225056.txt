Abstract    :
              Among the damage and destruction caused by earthquakes is                      
              that to historic architecture which, unlike other kinds of                     
              losses, often represent a permanent loss of the historic                       
              record and cultural identity of communities.  The series of                    
              earthquakes on April 25 and 26, 1992, in Humboldt County,                      
              California, that measured 7.1, 6.6, and 6.7 on the Richter                     
              scale damaged or destroyed approximately 1,000 buildings, a                    
              number of which were of significant architectural and                          
              historic interest dating from the period between 1870 and                      
              1900.  The proposed project would describe the event,                          
              briefly review the history of the area, indicate the damage                    
              and destruction to historic buildings, point out mitigation                    
              measures which could have prevented much of the damage at                      
              minimal cost, describe the disaster response process, and                      
              suggest methods to improve the treatment of historic                           
              buildings in relief and reconstruction efforts by government                   
              agencies.  Requested support would cover costs for a                           
              graduate student to visit the impacted area, physically                        
              survey damage, interview informed respondents in public                        
              agencies, preservation organizations, and consulting and                       
              construction firms, and cover other supplementary costs of                     
              the project.
