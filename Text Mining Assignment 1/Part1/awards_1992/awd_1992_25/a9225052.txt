Abstract    :
                   This project will bring ten students to the University of                 
              Nebraska-Lincoln for a two month period in the summer of 1993 to               
              work in the Computer Science Department in the area of human-                  
              computer interaction.  The opportunity to complete the project will            
              be available during the academic year.  Components of the project              
              are introductory readings and lectures to motivate the students in             
              the area, a seminar to familiarize them with the background for                
              their research, an interface prototyping project, a research                   
              project in which small groups of participants work together to                 
              choose a research question and instrument an experiment to study               
              it, and an optional academic year follow-up.  The project will also            
              include an ethics component that will address three areas; what                
              constitutes ethical personal behavior in research, social                      
              responsibility in scientific research, and ethical standards for               
              the treatment of human subjects.
