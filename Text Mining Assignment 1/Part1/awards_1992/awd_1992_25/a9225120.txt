Abstract    :
              Investigations of nuclear structure will be carried out by gamma               
              ray spectroscopy with large detector arrays, conversion electron               
              spectroscopy and by transient field and tilted-foil Beta NMR                   
              techniques.  These studies will be conducted at several                        
              laboratories: LBL, Argonne, Yale, Florida State, Rochester, and                
              Daresbury.  The onset of collective motion in neutron-deficient                
              polonium nuclei and the nature of the superdeformed excitations                
              in mass A - 194 nuclei will be investigated.  Electromagnetic                  
              moments will be measured in a wide range of light to heavy nuclei              
              in order to study the interplay between single particle and                    
              collective excitations, and to probe the structure of exotic                   
              nuclei far-from-stability, or at high spin or excitation energy.
