Abstract    :
              9225059  Kremen  Target taxon analysis:  a biogeographical, systematics approach
              to conservation inventories.  Little distributional data on plants and animals
              is available to guide conservation decision-making to maximize the protection
              of biological diversity.  That which does exist rarely represents the most
              diverse component of biodiversity, the insects.  Insects make up 95% of animal
              life, and are the mainstay of ecosystems, participating in myriad essential
              ecological interactions.  More information on insect distributions is needed so
              that conservation strategies can both protect the bulk biodiversity and ensure
              the long-term viability of ecosystems.  However, many insect species are
              undescribed, a factor which limits including them in inventory programs for
              conservation evaluation.  To obtain better data for conservation planning, a
              method (target taxon analysis) has therefore been proposed for choosing and
              utilizing informative insect indicator groups in conservation inventories.  %%%
               The present proposal requests funds to support further testing and refining if
              the method.  The work will be carried out in Madagascar, whose endangered rain
              forests constitute an international conservation priority.  The project will
              use an established butterfly target taxon (Lepidoptera:  Satyrinae: Henetosia)
              to:  (1) continue testing the method by comparing Henotesia distributions with
              those of both insect and vertebrate groups, (2) assess the effectiveness of
              target taxon analysis at different spatial scales, and (3) extend target taxon
              analysis from a method for rigorously selecting and evaluating indicators, to
              one which  can also be used for designing optimal reserve networks.  iences
