              analyze mathematical models of demographic and genetic factors and their
              interactions affecting the risk of population extinction. Demographic factors
              to be investigated include random catastrophes and their interaction with
              fluctuating environments, local extinction and colonization in spatially
              distributed "metapopulations", and harvesting of populations in a fluctuating
              environment.  Genetic factors to be investigated include inbreeding in small
              populations, deleterious mutation, random genetic drift, and adaptive evolution
              in changing environments. Methods from dynamical system theory and stochastic
              process theory will be employed, e.g. modeling fluctuating environments and
              random genetic drift as diffusion processes, and random catastrophes as a jump
              process.  The main quantities of interest are times and probabilities of
              extinction, especially the mean time to extinction.  Using suitable
              approximations, simple formulas will be derive that elucidate the extinction
              risks associated with each factor and their interactions.  Analytical results
              will be checked by computer simulation where feasible. %%% The results will
              help to establish a stronger theoretical foundation for the science of
              conservation biology.  A better understanding of factors causing extinction,
              particularly in small populations, will have immediate applications in
              viability analysis, and in conservation and restoration plans for threatened
              and endangered species. ***
