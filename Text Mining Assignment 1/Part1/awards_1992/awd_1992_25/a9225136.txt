Abstract    :
                            9225136  SCHNEIDER  This project has two goals: to preserve and
              provide automated  access to oral history recordings of Alaska Natives in a
              computer  program, and to introduce this resource to teachers of Alaska 
              history and Native studies. Research projects on Alaska history,  political
              developments, land use, geography, subsistence and  belief systems will be
              developed in collaboration with local  teachers. Funding is being provided to
              assess suitable audio  preservation technologies and the educational potentials
              of  interactive workstations in rural Alaska.  ***
