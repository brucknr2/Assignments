Abstract    :
              This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation Program                 
              will assist the Department of Chemistry at the University of                   
              Maryland in the purchase of an upgrade for an electron spin                    
              resonance (ESR) spectrometer.  This upgrade is essential if the                
              PI's are to make much more effective of the present equipment.                 
              The research projects that will be enhanced by the acquisition                 
              of this equipment include:                                                     
                                                                                             
              1)  Studies of the electronic structure of organometallic                      
              15-electron complexes,                                                         
              2)  Formation and electonic structure studies of 17 electron                   
              dihydride complexes,                                                           
              3)  Photochemical and electrochemical generation of                            
              arylnitrenium (Ar-N-R+) ions, probable intermediates in                        
              chemical carcinogenesis, and the study of their electronic                     
              structure,                                                                     
              4)  ESR studies of organometallic and molecular-based inorganic                
              polymers with bulk ferromagnetism and low dimensional                          
              conductivity,                                                                  
              5)  ESR studies of enzyme-stablized radicals in biological                     
              processes.                                                                     
                                                                                             
              %%%                                                                            
              An electron spin resonance (ESR) spectrometer provides                         
              information about the electronic structure of molecules and can                
              detect the presence of "free radicals" which play an important                 
              in many chemical and biological interactions.
