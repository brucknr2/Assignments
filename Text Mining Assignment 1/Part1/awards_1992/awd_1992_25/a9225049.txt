Abstract    :
              The workshop has a simple purpose:  to explore the feasibility of              
              designing, building, and using common infrastructure.  The key                 
              working product of the meeting will be a document that addresses               
              the following issues:                                                          
                   1.  Can we agree on a common set of representations to                    
                       support our varied research efforts?                                  
                                                                                             
                   2.  How can we design these representations and their                     
                       support software?                                                     
                                                                                             
                   3.  What would it cost to design, implement, adopt, and                   
                       maintain them?                                                        
                                                                                             
              The final point of consensus should be a recommendation for how                
              to proceed after this workshop.
