Abstract    :
              9225016  Olson    This study investigates the impact of different arbitration 
              systems, the role of uncertainty, and the impact of bargaining  information on
              negotiator behavior and dispute rates.  The study  consists of bargaining
              experiments where pairs of negotiators  bargain over the division of a sum of
              money for a fixed number of  periods.  The experiments vary the type of
              arbitration procedure  used if an agreement is not reached and the information
              available  to the negotiator about the arbitration process.  One experiment 
              compares negotiator behavior under final offer and two types of  conventional
              arbitration.  The conventional arbitration treatments  differ in the relative
              weight the arbitrator places on the offers  of the parties and the facts of the
              case.  The subjects'  uncertainty about the beliefs of the arbitrator is also 
              manipulated.  A second experiment focuses on the role of new  information and
              post-offer bargaining under final offer  arbitration.  The results of these
              studies will contribute to our  understanding of disputes across a variety of
              settings and the role  of dispute settlement procedures in the resolution of
              disputes.    ***
