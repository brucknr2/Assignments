Abstract    :
              Hill         The goal of this project is to design hardware and software  for
              scalable shared-address-space computers.  Cooperative shared  memory, the
              approach taken in the project, provides a simple  design for shared-memory
              hardware and a programming model that  can be used by programmers and compilers
              to understand an  application's communication behavior.  Cooperative shared
              memory  uses simple directory hardware together with a set of pragmas for  use
              in applications software.  The pragmas allow the applications  software to
              indicate which processors will be using a block of  memory:  a processor can
              check out a block when it expects  frequent use, check it back in when it is
              done, and can indicate  that it expects to check out a block in the near
              future.  Simple  directory hardware can be used to place checked-out-memory 
              locations in the caches of the appropriate processors.  Common  state
              transitions in the directory protocol are implemented in  hardware, while the
              less common ones use software traps.  Note  that the pragmas and the resulting
              hardware actions affect only  the execution speed of a program, not its
              correctness.         A new virtual prototyping approach is being used for 
              evaluating the new architecture.  The Wisconsin Wind Tunnel runs  parallel
              shared-memory programs on a parallel message-passing  computer and concurrently
              evaluates the programs execution times  on proposed hardware using a
              distributed simulation.  The  simulation runs quickly because instructions that
              make only local  memory references are executed directly.
