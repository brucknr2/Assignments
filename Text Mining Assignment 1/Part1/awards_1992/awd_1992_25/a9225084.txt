Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  The Principal Investigator will travel to London for a week to            
              xerox the clinical growth records of the primates at the London                
              Zoo, which is closing.  The records may well become unavailable or             
              lost at that time.  The proposers will to transfer the records to              
              their primate growth data base and to analyze them within the                  
              framework of their continuing study of the development of sexual               
              dimorphism in different primate species.                                       
                                                                                             
                   This is a timely and important project.  Sexual dimorphism is             
              once again an interesting topic in evolutionary studies, and it is             
              being tied to different mating strategies or alternatively,                    
              different diets.  It is also clear that the development of sexual              
              dimorphism (its timing during growth, etc.) is an important dynamic            
              that has not been adequately addressed, where most often the focus             
              has been on adult animals.
