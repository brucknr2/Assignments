Abstract    :
                   Zhang will continue his research on various invariants of C*-             
              algebras, including the real rand, the topological stable rand, the            
              exponential rand and length, the C*-projective length of the                   
              Grassmann space, and the homotopy groups of the unitary group and              
              the Grassmann space of certain C*-algebras.  He will also continue             
              his investigation on the internal structure of the multiplier                  
              algebras in terms of the K-theory and its torsion subgroup of the              
              associated C*-algebra.                                                         
                   The general area of mathematics of this project has its basis             
              in the theory of algebras of Hilbert space operators.  Operators               
              can be thought of as finite or infinite matrices of complex                    
              numbers.  Special types of operators are often put together in an              
              algebra, naturally called an operator algebra.  These abstract                 
              objects have a surprising variety of applications.  For example,               
              they play a key role in knot theory, which in turn is currently                
              being used to study the structure of DNA, and they are of                      
              fundamental importance in noncommutative geometry, which is                    
              becoming increasingly important in physics.
