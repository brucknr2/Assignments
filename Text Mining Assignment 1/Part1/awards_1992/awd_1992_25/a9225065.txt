Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The research supported under this project will focus on                        
              observational infrared studies of the highest luminosity                       
              infrared bright galaxies, quasars and active galactic                          
              nuclei, faint redshift galaxies, and objects studied at                        
              diffraction limited spatial resolution.  There will be                         
              implementation of tip-tilt correction for image motion to                      
              achieve improved image quality in the infrared on the 200-                     
              inch telescope at Mt. Palomar.                                                 
                                                                                             
              The study of the ultra luminous infrared galaxies will                         
              address the questions of the power source in these objects.                    
              There will also be an attempt at determining their                             
              relationship to Active Galactic Nuclei.  There will be                         
              studies on how star formation begins (and proceeds) in high                    
              infrared luminosity, interacting galaxies.  There will be                      
              high spatial resolution observations of regions of star                        
              formation, and the nearest galaxies containing active                          
              galactic nuclei.                                                               
                                                                                             
              The Principal Investigator is regarded as a world leader in                    
              this research area.
