Abstract    :
                   Problems in the interface of statistics, mathematics and                  
              computational science will be studied, focusing on Fourier                     
              approximation and ridge estimation of regression and density                   
              functions and, in a separate context, on filtered Dirichlet                    
              distributions for local smoothing.  In particular, preference                  
              orders will be studied for the frequency weights in multiple                   
              Fourier expansions and for the connection weights in single                    
              hidden-layer neural networks.  Properties will be derived and                  
              applications such as feature extraction and projection pursuit                 
              will be considered in detail.                                                  
                   This research will aid in automated learning from large data              
              sets such as those arising in robotics, medicine and artificial                
              intelligence.  One aspect of the work will develop sophisticated               
              mathematical techniques for application to problems in statistics              
              and electrical engineering.  A second aspect of the work will                  
              develop statistical methods to utilize an expert's knowledge                   
              directly without restricting the form in which the expert must                 
              express this information.
