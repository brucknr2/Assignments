Abstract    :
                   This RUI grant supports basic research in relativistic                    
              nuclear reaction theory.  Specific applications will be made                   
              to understand present (p,2p) and planned (e,e'p) experiments.                  
              Work will also be done on the relativistic 3-body problem.
