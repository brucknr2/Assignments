Abstract    :
              Reasoning algorithms are used in many application areas of                     
              computer science and artificial intelligence.  High                            
              performance of reasoning algorithms is indispensable to the                    
              successes of these applications, because of the high                           
              complexity of real problems.  A software system called RRL,                    
              the Rewrite Rule Laboratory, developed over the past years                     
              with the NSF support has been successfully used for solving                    
              many problems often considered a challenge for automated                       
              theorem provers.                                                               
                                                                                             
              This project will further increase the reasoning power of RRL.                 
              The objectives of this research will be to develop new high                    
              performance reasoning algorithms, and to apply these                           
              algorithms in specification and verification of hardware and                   
              software.  The research will focus on redundance control of                    
              automated deduction and mathematical induction.  The topics                    
              include restricted inference rules, powerful simplication                      
              rules, unnecessary computation detection, induction schemata                   
              formulation, induction hypotheses handling, and efficient                      
              implemenations of all the involved algorithms.  Practical                      
              verification problems will be chosen from software and hardware                
              design as test problems for RRL and RRL will be enhanced to                    
              meet the need of large-scale applications by providing                         
              failure-resistant and user-friendly interfaces.  Special                       
              effort will be made on distributing RRL worldwide to the                       
              people interested in automated reasoning.
