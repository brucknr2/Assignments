Abstract    :
              Microlithographic quasi-two-dimensional complex surfaces will be               
              constructed through which DNA will be electrophoresed.  The                    
              motions of large single molecules through these obstacle arrays                
              will be observed using real-time fluorescence imaging techniques.              
              %%%                                                                            
              These devices should allow the fractionation of DNA molecules at               
              the chromosome length scale in a highly reproducible environment.              
              The ability to bind and move very long DNA molecules through                   
              synthetic microlithographic surfaces may be used to align                      
              chromosomal length DNA molecules on complex designed surfaces, to              
              analyze the DNA sequence using scanning techniques and to probe                
              DNA structure using optical sensors.  The overall aim of the                   
              project is single molecule processing.
