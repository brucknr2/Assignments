Abstract    :
              Photosystem I (PS I), the light-dependent plastocyanin-                        
              ferredoxin oxidoreductase, is a photosynthetic multisubunit                    
              pigment-protein complex in the thylakoid membranes of                          
              chloroplasts and cyanobacteria.  All cofactors and electron                    
              transfer centers in PS I are associated with three                             
              polypeptides; the role of the accessory polypeptides, (2) study                
              of the requirements and mechanism of assembly of these                         
              accessory subunits into PS I complex.  The most feasible                       
              approach to achieve the first objective involves molecular                     
              cloning and characterization of the genes encoding these                       
              polypeptides in the naturally transformable cyanobacterium                     
              Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 and then generating mutants                         
              specifically lacking these genes by targeted mutagenesis.                      
              Biochemical and spectroscopic analyses of PS I from these                      
              mutants will be conducted to assess the effects of loss of                     
              individual accessory polypeptides on the assembly and function                 
              of PS I.  In vitro reconstitution systems will be used to                      
              identify the physiological requirements for the assembly of                    
              these polypeptides into PS I and to determine the sequence of                  
              their assembly.                                                                
              %%%                                                                            
              Plants, green algae and cyanobacteria convert light energy into                
              chemical energy with the evolution of molecular oxygen by the                  
              process of photosynthesis.  Oxygenic photosynthesis is the                     
              major source of biological energy and oxygen on this planet and                
              a better understanding of this process is essential for facing                 
              the food and environmental challenges of the future.
