Abstract    :
              This research program will develop new methods for the study of                
              material microscale geometric and physical randomness. The effort              
              will focus on the areas of effective response of graph-                        
              representable materials, and on neighborhoods (which allows for                
              both nearest and distant neighbor interaction) will be used,                   
              leading to Markov field models that will be used to predict                    
              effective response laws and the onset of instabilities.  Emphasis              
              in the second area is on the development of a stochastic method                
              and solutions for determining plastic flow and stress fields in a              
              granular medium whose yield condition is a random field of space               
              coordinates. This will lead to a procedure for the stochastic                  
              generalization of the method of characteristics, which will allow              
              for the study of slip-line fields and wave propagation in                      
              realistic models of granular media.*** //
