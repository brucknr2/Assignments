Abstract    :
              Liquid aerosol thermolysis (LAT) refers to the general class                   
              of particle synthesis processes in which a liquid precursor                    
              solution is atomized into discrete droplets and subsequently                   
              transported through a time/temperature/atmosphere-regulated                    
              reactor.  The overall objective of the proposed program is to                  
              establish a fundamental engineering science for the synthesis                  
              of submicron, composite particles by liquid aerosol                            
              thermolysis.  Particle synthesis and solution experiments are                  
              designed to identify those factors affecting solid composite                   
              particle formation and chemical distribution.  In situ                         
              technique will be used to monitor droplets generation and                      
              shrinkage during the evaporation stage as a function of                        
              atomization, precursor solution characteristics and                            
              evaporation conditions.  After the evaporation stage, on-line                  
              sampling will be used to obtain and characterize particles as                  
              a function of time and temperature.  Each process step will be                 
                                                                                             
              mathematically analyzed using information generated in the                     
              above experiments and evaluated against existing or derived                    
              models for those processes.  Model systems, based on alumina                   
              precursors as the matrix phase, have been selected examine                     
              first the synthesis of homogeneous composite systems in which                  
              the nanocrystalline phases are uniformly dispersed and second,                 
                                                                                             
              those in which one phase encapsulates the other.  Zinconia and                 
                                                                                             
              platinum in alumina allow use to examine issues associated                     
              with uniform precipitation whereas alumina-SiC allows us the                   
              possibility to examine the isolation of one phase (SiC)                        
              within another (i.e. intragranular).                                           
                                                                                             
              The proposed techniques aim to production of nanocrystalline                   
              materials of a wide compositional range and having 100 nm                      
              crystallinity, of desired uniformity and second phase                          
              distribution.
