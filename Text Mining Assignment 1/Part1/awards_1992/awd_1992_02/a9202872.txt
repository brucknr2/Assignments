Abstract    :
              The proposed research consists of three concurrent thrusts: (1) the            
              electrodeposition of new ceramic superlattices, such as those of               
              PbSnO, PbBiO, TlSnO, and PbAgO; (2) a study of the optical                     
              properties of nanomodulated materials, which has bearings on the               
              effects of quantum confinement and the tunable IR reflectivity; and            
              (3) a scanning probe microscopy study of epitaxial growth of the               
              nanomodulated superlattices.                                                   
              The STM/AFM will also be used to study the feasibility of                      
              depositing single crystal superlattices.

              This project pursues the new and interesting results of                        
              electrodeposition of ceramic superlattices to more oxide systems.              
              It will also investigate their optical properties.  It will also               
              study the epitaxial growth of these superlattice with the use of               
              scanning probe microscopy . The feasibility of depositing single               
              crystal superlattices will be explored as well.  Based on the                  
              encouraging preliminary results, these superlattices have shown                
              lattice perfection qualities comparable to those of MBE products.              
              This method could have the possibility of becoming a very important            
              industrial process.  This study will provide important and                     
              fundamental scientific and technical information about the                     
              electrodeposition process.
