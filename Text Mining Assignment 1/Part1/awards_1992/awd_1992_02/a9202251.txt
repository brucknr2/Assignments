Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This study will develop methods for inferring the emplacement                  
              conditions of submarine lava flows based on their surface                      
              morphology and texture, using laboratory simulations, modeling and             
              mapping of undersea flows.  Laboratory experiments will use                    
              polyethylene glycol in tanks of cold sucrose to simulate silicate              
              lavas.  Dredge samples will be used to estimate eruption rates of              
              flows from their crystal content and rheological properties.  The              
              results will ultimately lead to constraining models of ridge                   
              evolution.
