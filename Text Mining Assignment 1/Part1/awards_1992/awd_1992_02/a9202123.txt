Abstract    :
              This project is to research the                                                
              synthesis of two classes of                                                    
              materials.  The first is                                                       
              biominerals, in particular, calcium                                            
              carbonate, a well defined model in                                             
              biomineralization studies.  The                                                
              objective here is develop systems                                              
              for the control of crystal size and                                            
              morphology.  The biomimetic                                                    
              environments selected are those                                                
              that exert spatial and structural                                              
              control of mineralization. Reversed

              films will be used. In addition,                                               
              the role of proteins that regulate                                             
              mineralization through geometric                                               
              and stereochemical lattice matching                                            
              will be investigated.  The second                                              
              class of materials is semiconductor

              sulfides and selenides.  Synthesis                                             
              will again be approached through                                               
              the use of reverse micelle                                                     
              environments.  Control in-situ is                                              
              to be carried out by a novel

              examine the effects of hydrate
