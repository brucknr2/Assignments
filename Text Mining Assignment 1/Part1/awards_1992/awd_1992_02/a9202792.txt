Abstract    :
                   A system to provide the information necessary for the control             
              of multiple free-ranging automatic guided vehicles will be                     
              developed based on the use of stationary visual cameras, or what               
              is termed "global vision," in order to expand the range of                     
              applications for which they are a high-performance and cost-                   
              effective transport alternative.  The expected results of such a               
              system include: increased transport throughput because vehicles can            
              operate faster and globally efficient paths can be planned;                    
              improved safety due to increased collision detection and avoidance             
              capabilities; and reduced vehicle costs.                                       
                   In order to demonstrate that global vision is technically                 
              feasible for vehicle control and is cost-effective as compared to              
              other feasible means of control, the following tasks will be                   
              performed: (1) camera placement, where algorithms will be developed            
              to determine a minimal number of cameras and their positions in a              
              facility; (2) object tracking, where difference image-based methods            
              will be developed to detect and track moving objects; (3)                      
              performance measurement, where actual hardware and software                    
              implementations will be used to demonstrate the technical                      
              feasibility of global vision for a typical factory shop floor; and             
              (4) economic feasibility, where analysis techniques will be                    
              developed to compare different methods of controlling free-ranging             
              transport vehicles.
