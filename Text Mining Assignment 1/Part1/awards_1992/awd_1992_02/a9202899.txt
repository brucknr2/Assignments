Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Stonehill College requests support from NSF for connection of its              
              campus network to NSFNET.  NEARnet is the midlevel network                     
              located in the New England region that will provide operations                 
              and network information services.  It will give Stonehill College              
              a 56 thousand bits per second connection to the NSFNET, a high                 
              speed (1.5 - 45 million bits per second) National Backbone                     
              network.                                                                       
                                                                                             
              The College needs greater functionality and network speed to be                
              able to access supercomputers, libraries, and make file transfers              
              along with being able to implement a more reliable mail system.                
              Students and faculty research will benefit from the link.  This                
              is also a unique opportunity for the school to explore innovative              
              educational resources.***
