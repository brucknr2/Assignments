Abstract    :
                   This award supports theoretical research on reactions                     
              involving few-body nuclei at intermediate energies.  This                      
              includes continuing work on meson photo-production, inelastic                  
              electron scattering, and studies to test hyperon-nucleon                       
              interactions.  This work will be supportive of on-going and                    
              planned electron scattering experiments at Bates and CEBAF.
