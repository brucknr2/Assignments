Abstract    :
                   This award supports the research of Professor E. Schulte to               
              work in combinatorics.  He intends to investigate abstract                     
              regular polytopes.  In particular he intends to completely                     
              classify the regular polytopes which are globally or locally of                
              toroidal type as well as connections between regular polytopes                 
              and buildings.                                                                 
                   The research is in the general area of combinatorics.                     
              Combinatorics attempts to find efficient methods to study how                  
              discrete collections of objects can be organized.  And, so it is               
              extremely important to modern communications, for example the                  
              design of large networks as in telephone systems and the design                
              of algorithms in computer science.
