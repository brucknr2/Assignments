Abstract    :
                   During the last two decades more and more studies have                    
              demonstrated that the population dynamics of copepods in coastal               
              areas are dependent upon the existence of benthic resting eggs.                
              Understanding the numerical contribution of eggs to naupliar                   
              recruitment is not sufficient, however, to accurately predict                  
              population and community dynamics especially on evolutionary time              
              scales.  If eggs accumulate over an extended period of time                    
              (greater than a reproductive season) and form an egg bank, their               
              hatching may slow the rate of evolutionary change of the species.              
              This is because egg banks represent the genetic history of the                 
              population.  The longer eggs survive the greater will be the                   
              genetic memory contained in the egg bank.  These field studies will            
              determine if eggs can survive at least three years in situ.  The               
              impact of anoxia and hydrogen sulfide on resting egg viability will            
              be assessed in laboratory experiments designed to simulate field               
              conditions.
