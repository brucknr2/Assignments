Abstract    :
              A broad range of theoretical issues dealing with multi-agent                   
              learning systems will be investigated.  Cooperation is the key                 
              to successfully completing a task when more than one agent is                  
              involved.  Attention will be restricted to learning system                     
              where multiple agents cooperate in learning a concept (or                      
              function).  The ultimate goal is to devise templates for                       
              cooperating learning strategies which hopefully can be applied                 
              to other practical problems.  The goal will be approached by                   
              investigating learners with differing convergence and/or                       
              correctness criteria as well as other features such as                         
              totality of hypothesized programs and resource boundedness.                    
              This wide spectrum of type of learners will help in                            
              identifying the true nature and complexity of the cooperation                  
              one should expect in multi-agent learning systems.  In                         
              particular, an on-going investigation of the structure of                      
              probabilistic and pluralistic hierarchy in FIN-type (and                       
              subsequently in other types of)learning will be continued,                     
              which recently revealed a new but very intimate cooperative                    
              strategy.
