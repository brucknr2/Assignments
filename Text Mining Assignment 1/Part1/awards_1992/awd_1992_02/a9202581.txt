Abstract    :
                   This is the first year of a three-year continuing award.  This            
              research investigates task-level planning for autonomous agents,               
              such as mobile robots, that function in an uncertain environment.              
              These robots typically have very approximate, inaccurate, or                   
              minimal models of the environment.  For example, although the                  
              geometry of its environment is crucial to determining its                      
              performance, a mobile robot might only have a partial, or local                
              "map" of the world.  The research will investigate an approach                 
              whereby the robot attempts to acquire the necessary information                
              about the world by planning a series of experiments using the                  
              robot's sensors and actuators, and building data structures based              
              on the robot's observations of these experiments.  A key feature of            
              this approach is that the experiments the robot performs should be             
              driven by the information demands of the task.  This research                  
              develops (1) a theory of sensor interpretation and task-directed               
              planning using perceptual equivalence classes, intended to be                  
              applicable in highly uncertain or unmodelled environments, such as             
              for a mobile robot; (2) algorithmic techniques for modeling                    
              geometric constraints on recognizability, and the building of                  
              internal representations (such as maps) using these constraints;               
              (3) explicit encoding of the  information requirements of a task               
              using a lattice (information hierarchy) of recognizable sets, which            
              allows the robot to perform experiments to recognize a situation or            
              a landmark; and (4) synthesis of robust mobot programs using the               
              geometric constraints, constructive recognizability experiments,               
              and uncertainty models imposed by the task.  This research will                
              also implement the theory and test it on mobile robots in                      
              the laboratory.
