Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  The P.I. has carried out significant research on isotope and              
              trace element geochemistry of EPR (9o30'N, 13p30'-15oN), MAR(36oN),            
              the Gorda Ridge, President Jackson Seamounts, & S. Atlantic hot                
              spot tracks.  He now wishes to continue this effort and analyze                
              trace element abundances in basalts from both Pacific and Atlantic             
              oceans with the objective of characterizing source compositions and            
              magmatic processes in the two ridge systems that have very                     
              different spreading rates.  Additionally, he will analyze zero age             
              and somewhat older basalts from the EPR area in order to evaluate              
              the processes which cause temporal geochemical variations in magma             
              evolution along the EPR.  An important thrust of the present                   
              project is the determination of the U, Th and Pb abundances of                 
              oceanic basalts from EPR, FAMOUS, and some ocean island areas.  The            
              purpose is to characterize U/Pb and Th/U ratios of mantle plumes               
              vs. the depleted N-MORB reservoir.  The ultimate goal of this                  
              project is to quantify geochemical models of mantle sources                    
              (plumes, depleted reservoirs) and the processes which affect crust             
              formation at mid-oceanic ridges.
