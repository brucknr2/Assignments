Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This project is a collaborative effort to study thin film                      
              ferroelectrics.  The team is composed of a synthetic solid state               
              inorganic chemist (academic), an electron microscopist/materials               
              scientist (academic), and a solid state physicist and                          
              characterizations laboratory (industrial).  The purpose of this                
              project is to gain a thorough understanding of how synthetic                   
              methods modify the properties of thin film barium titanate and lead            
              zircornium titanate.                                                           
                                                                                             
              The thin films will be prepared using two substantially different              
              processes:  chemical vapor deposition and organo-metallic                      
              decomposition (sol-gel type chemistry).  Different experimental                
              approaches will be examined within these two general synthetic                 
              methods.  Careful structural and chemical characterization of the              
              films will be performed to determine the effects of the synthetic              
              process.  Detailed physical methods will determine the                         
              ferroelectric properties of these films and there resistance to                
              failure.  It is the goal of this project to correlate the                      
              processing method with the ferroelectric properties and to optimize            
              the synthetic plan.                                                            
                                                                                             
              This project is being supported jointly by the Division of                     
              Materials Research and Division of Electrical and Communication                
              Systems.
