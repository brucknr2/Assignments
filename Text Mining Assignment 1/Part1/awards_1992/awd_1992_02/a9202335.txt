Abstract    :
              Large oceanic plateaus are enormous submarine volcanic platforms               
              that are probably marine equivalents of catastrophically erupted               
              continental flood basalt provinces. Recent research on exposed                 
              volcanic rocks in the Caribbean suggest that both the Caribbean                
              crust and surrounding ophiolites may have been formed during a                 
              major volcanic episode. Research on this award will explore this               
              hypothesis by detailed dating of these volcanic rocks.
