Abstract    :
              This research involves experimental investigations of strain                   
              localization on single - and poly-crystalline ductile-matrix                   
              material systems, analyses of mechanisms of micro-localization,                
              e.g. shear banding, at intermediate and large plastic strains in               
              these material systems, and the development of constitutive                    
              relations for the effective plastic response of ductile materials              
              including the effects of complex multi-slip hardening, particles               
              and pores, and microscopic shear localizations.  The goal is to                
              develop techniques to achieve optimal processing conditions so as              
              to avoid undesirable flow localizations.
