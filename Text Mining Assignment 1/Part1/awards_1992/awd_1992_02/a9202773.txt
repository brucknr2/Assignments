Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              A large and unique data set of current, inverted echo sounder and              
              microstructure profiles collected in Puget Sound will be analyzed              
              to identify and quantify turbulent mixing induced by tidal forcing,            
              free-shear instabilities, intrusions and hydraulic jumps over                  
              sills. The analysis will constrast interior mixing away from                   
              topography to boundary mixing due to topographical features.
