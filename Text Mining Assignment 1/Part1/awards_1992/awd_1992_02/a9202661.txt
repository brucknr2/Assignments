Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  The slow-spreading Mid-Atlantic Ridge (MAR) consists of both              
              symmetrical and asymmetrical rift valley segments or spreading                 
              cells that are linked end-to-end by transform faults and "non-                 
              transform offsets" or accommodation zones and is similar to the                
              structure of many continental rifts. Of the various components of              
              MAR architecture the most important faulting occurs at the major               
              border faults of asymmetrical (half-graben) spreading cells and at             
              the accommodation zones that link them to adjacent cells. Typical              
              examples of these feature are present in the MARK Area (23"N on the            
              Mid-Atlantic Ridge) and can be investigated by Alvin in 1992.                  
                   A joint U.S./French (F.A.R.A.) program of 20 dives to will be             
              attempted investigate the surface manifestations of extensional                
              tectonics in the southern part of the MARK Area about 100 km south             
              of the Kane Transform. Two major geophysically defined structures              
              will be investigated. 1.) The primary target will be the zone                  
              teleseismic and microseismic activity along the steep eastern                  
              median valley wall at about 22'30'N (Toomey et al., 1985; 1988).               
              This is interpreted as a seismically active fault zone and perhaps             
              a juvenile detachment fault. 2.) The secondary target will be the              
              accommodation zone at the north end of the same spreading cell.                
              This lies at the surface intersection of a zone at the north end of            
              the same spreading cell.  This lies at the surface intersection of             
              a major north-dipping intra-crustal reflector identified in recent             
              multichannel seismic reflection studies that may be a low-angle                
              oblique-slip fault (lateral ramp).                                             
                   The Alvin dives will permit detailed mapping and structural               
              measurement of various features (fault surfaces, shear zones,                  
              foliations, lineations, dikes and flows, etc.) in outcrops of                  
              deformed basement rocks. The goal is to use the correlation between            
              seismic and geologic data to help bridge the gap between tectonic              
              processes and the creation of near-axial bathymetric features.
