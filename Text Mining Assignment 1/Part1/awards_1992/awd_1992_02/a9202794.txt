Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              A major field effort took place in 1988-89 to study the details of             
              two Gulf Stream meanders using a combination of rapid ship survey              
              and satellite imagery. The analysis of the data will continue with             
              special emphasis on calculating the dynamical balance of the                   
              meanders and relating microstructure activity to intrusive                     
              interleavings and/or shear instabilities.
