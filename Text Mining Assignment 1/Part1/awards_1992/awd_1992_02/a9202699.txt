Abstract    :
              The photoluminesence of II-VI or III-V semiconductor is used                   
              to identify reversible adsorption of molecules on                              
              semiconductor surfaces.  These interactions are interpreted in                 
              terms of the steric and electronic landscape of the                            
              semiconductor surface.                                                         
              The studies are extended to the fabrication and development of                 
              robust, real-time, in-situ monitors of the gas-phase                           
              composition in chemical vapor deposition (CVD) process                         
              streams.  These sensors are based on photoluminescence,                        
              photoconductivity, or ungated field-effect transitor (FET)                     
              design, take advantage of the changes in the work function of                  
              the semiconductor on reversible adsorption.  Using multisensor                 
              arrays, a complement of CVD precursors is monitored                            
              simultaneously.  Optimization and testing of sensors is done                   
              in collaboration with Sandia National Laboratory.                              
                                                                                             
              Improves quality control in the production by CVD of complex                   
              electronic materials is the key to an improved competitive                     
              position in these key materials.  Achievement of this is                       
              hampered by a lack of monitoring devices that give a picture                   
              of what is happening in the CVD process.  This project attacks                 
              this issue directly, aiming at real-time sensors that are                      
              suitable for use in automated or manual control systems.                       
                                                                                             
              This award is part of the Materials Synthesis and Processing                   
              Initiative.
