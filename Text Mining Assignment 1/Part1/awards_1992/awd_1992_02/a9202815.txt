Abstract    :
                   This proposal will partially support the participant costs                
              to a conference on Variations on the Likelihood Principle.  The                
              meeting will be of two-and-one half days duration and will                     
              feature leading active researchers from a wide range of subjects               
              within likelihood.  One goal of the conference will be to foster               
              interaction and the dispersion of scientific knowledge among                   
              workers linked by the common thread of likelihood.  A second goal              
              is to provide a stimulus to young researchers and graduate                     
              students in this area.                                                         
                   This proposal will partial support the Institute of                       
              Mathematical Statistics 225th Special Topics Meeting: Variations               
              on the Likelihood Principle, to be held in on the Pennsylvania                 
              State University Campus, October 25-28, 1992.
