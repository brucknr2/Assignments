Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  The goal of the Multi-Instrumented Studies of Equatorial                  
              Thermosphere Aeronomy (MISETA) program is to improve understanding             
              of equatorial thermosphere aeronomy through studies that combine               
              continuous measurements from a variety of automatically operating              
              instruments.  The PIs propose to augment the ground-based                      
              diagnostics at the CEDAR equatorial observatory in Peru with two               
              automatic instruments that would measure the zonal drift of                    
              kilometer scale irregularities and all sky airglow surface                     
              brightness.  In addition, the PIs propose an upgrade for the Fabry             
              Perot interferometer to modernize the data acquisition capability              
              for automatic measurements of the F-region neutral wind field.                 
              This particular project will upgrade the spaced antenna drift                  
              measuring capability in Ancon, Peru with an automatic data                     
              acquisition system.
