Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  Intermediate wavelength seasurface height (SSH) undulations               
              over the Pacific plate appear to represent the platform of                     
              secondary mantle convection. Several aspects of these intermediate             
              SSH undulations will be addressed, including: 1) analyze the SSH               
              data in the Pacific to determine the presence and nature of the                
              undulations; 2) verify the robustness of the phenomenon by                     
              establishing whether the SSh undulations exist on other plates; 3)             
              test the possible mechanisms capable of causing these undulations              
              (e.g. mantle convection).
