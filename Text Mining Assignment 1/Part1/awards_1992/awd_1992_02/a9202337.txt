Abstract    :
              This is a proposal to purchase a confocal scanning light                       
              microscope to be used by a group of developmental and cell                     
              biologists.  This microscope uses a solid-state beam                           
              deflecting device to achieve very high speed image                             
              recording.  The instrument will be used predominantly for                      
              developmental studies, reconstructing critical events in                       
              animal development.  Fluorescent markers will be used to tag                   
              specific cells or molecules in the developing organism, and                    
              confocal microscope images will be acquired, stored,                           
              reconstructed and analyzed using integrated computer                           
              software.  The group of developmental biologists proposes to                   
              study pattern formation and cellular determination in a                        
              variety of organisms.  They will also study nerve cell                         
              growth and differentiation during development.  Cell                           
              biologists will use the microscope to visualize and analyze                    
              transient events, such as transport, organelle assembly,                       
              orientation and disassembly.
