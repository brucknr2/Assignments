Abstract    :
              9202417  Maul  This proposal requests the funds for a confocal microscope  to be
              used by a multi-user group.  The major users will  utilize the instrument in
              projects over the long term.  Projects include the 3D reconstruction of
              changing  chromosomal domains during differentiation and of specific  and newly
              found nuclear domains, the changing inter-  relationships of cells during
              development or induced  differentiation by retinoic acids or by coculture in
              skin  reconstruction, the different distribution of mRNA in whole  developing
              embryos, and the relative localization of  specific genes in the intact nucleus
              (mapping).  Aside from  these larger projects minor projects have been
              identified  and initiated by different laboratories at The Wistar  Institute in
              particular in the developing structural biology  program.  These will be
              supervised by the principal  investigator.  Projects are diverse and need an
              efficient  way to study cell or tissue architecture in the 0.1 to 1 m  range in
              specimens that have a thickness of  0.1-1-mm.  Confocal microscopy in its
              advanced state provides us with  the means to achieve our goals.
