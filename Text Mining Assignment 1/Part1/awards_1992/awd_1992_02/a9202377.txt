Abstract    :
                   The project will study damage-free ultraprecision machining               
              processes on advanced ceramic materials.  The goal is to generate              
              an improved understanding of the material-removal processes that               
              occur in nanometer-scale grinding of ceramics, and ultimately to               
              be able to control grinding damage generation in-process. The                  
              research plan includes extending the ductile-regime grinding model             
              to include toughened ceramics, and defining grinding machining                 
              parameters required for these materials.  Further modification of              
              the grinding process by the introduction of engineered                         
              chemomechanical effects on the ceramic surface will be developed,              
              through controlled surface toughening.  A goal of this research is             
              to develop a real-time acoustic emissions feedback system to                   
              measure and control grinding damage in-process.  Through                       
              preliminary research, the sensitivity of acoustic emissions to                 
              material removal processes has been established.  Understanding                
              the basis of that sensitivity and its relationship to subsurface               
              fracture generation will guide development of an effective control             
              strategy.                                                                      
                   It is expected that as a direct result of this research: (1)              
              models for ductile-regime grinding, developed by the principal                 
              investigator, will be extended to include tough, advanced ceramic              
              materials; (2) chemomechanical effects in machining of ceramics                
              will be studied with regard to their potential for altering the                
              surface properties of ceramics, thereby enhancing the machinability            
              of candidate ceramic materials; and (3) fracture-generated acoustic            
              emissions signals will be analyzed in a basic study of the these               
              elastic waves and their relationship to grinding-induced subsurface            
              damage.
