Abstract    :
              This project attempts to study the                                             
              following key problems in active                                               
              control:  1) the standard optimal                                              
              control technique requires the                                                 
              knowledge of the entire time                                                   
              history of the structural response                                             
              to compute the necessary control                                               
              force by solving the Riccati                                                   
              equation.  In the mean time,                                                   
              instantaneous optimal control                                                  
              algorithm was developed for on-line                                            
              control.  It lacks the analytical                                              
              argument to prove its convergence                                              
              and controllability in the global                                              
              sense, and 2) the validity of the                                              
              assumption that the control force                                              
              is proportional to the                                                         
              displacement, velocity and                                                     
              acceleration of the structure                                                  
              subjected to earthquake loading.                                               
              This assumption is acceptable if                                               
              and only if the excitation force to                                            
              the structure is ignored in the                                                
              determination of the control force                                             
              from minimizing the objective                                                  
              function.                                                                      
                                                                                             
              To answer the above questions, two                                             
              types of control schemes are                                                   
              studied in this project:  the pole                                             
              placement controller and the neural                                            
              network controller.  These two                                                 
              schemes will be investigated both                                              
              analytically and experimentally.                                               
              In addition, optical fiber sensors                                             
              will be applied to the scaled model                                            
              structures.  Through comparison of                                             
              test signals between the optical                                               
              fiber sensors and classical                                                    
              sensors, suggestions for                                                       
              improvements of the sensor system                                              
              for use in civil engineering                                                   
              structures will be made possible.                                              
              Overall, this project will be                                                  
              undertaken through the following                                               
              three major research tasks:                                                    
              (1) control methodology; (2) scaled                                            
              structural model experimental test                                             
              on shake table; and (3) improvement                                            
              of sensor systems.
