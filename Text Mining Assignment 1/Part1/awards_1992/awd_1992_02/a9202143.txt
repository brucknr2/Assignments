Abstract    :
              Fundamentals of boundary lubrication will be investigated by                   
              studying the lubricating mechanisms which operate in extremely thin            
              polymeric boundary lubricant films.  The equipment used is a                   
              modified surface force microscope.  Measurements of effective                  
              viscosity and elasticity and of limiting shear stress will be made             
              over a wide range of film thickness, from monomolecular layers to              
              bulk, and for strain rates up to 10*8/sec.  Molecules to be tested             
              include a number of linear and branched alkanes and                            
              perfluoropolyethers as well as aqueous media.  The confining                   
              surfaces will include mica, bonded lubricants and metallized                   
              surfaces.
