Abstract    :
                   This grant supports the research of Professor H. Iwaniec and              
              W. Duke to work on several problems connected with analytic                    
              number theory and automorphic forms.  In particular, they will                 
              attempt to establish analytic continuation of L-functions derived              
              from the product of two L-functions which have functional                      
              equations.  They will also attempt to establish the                            
              equidistribution of roots of quadratic congruences to prime                    
              module and finally they will study generalization of the Linnik                
              problem about lattice points in family of varieties.                           
                   This is research in the field of number theory.   Number                  
              theory starts with the whole numbers and questions such as the                 
              divisibility of one whole number by another.  It is among the                  
              oldest fields of mathematics and it was originally pursued for                 
              purely aesthetic reasons.  However, within the last half century,              
              it has become an essential tool in developing new algorithms for               
              computer science and new error correcting codes for electronics.
