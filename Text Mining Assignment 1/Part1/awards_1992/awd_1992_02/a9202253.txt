Abstract    :
              9202253  Smith       This is the first year of a three-year continuing award to 
              investigate how computer users adapt from the use of introductory  systems to
              the use of more advanced systems.  This study involves  not only the issues
              related to user adaptation but also to the  mediating effects that a computer
              system can provide.  The  methodology is based on comparisons of basic and
              advanced system  tasks in the areas of expository writing and of computer 
              programming.  The cross-task transfer effects are also examined, as  well as
              any noticeable longitudinal effects in patterns of use and  adaption over time
              as subjects become more familiar with the  systems.  Variations in the
              graphical representations of the same  structural information are also
              considered in the sequence of  experiments.  A methodological issue considered
              is the direct  examination of the effects of the subject's "thinking-aloud" on 
              potential behavioral distortions and completeness and consistency  of the
              protocol data.  The extension of current concepts to a more  general cognitive
              architecture based on cognitive modes and  strategies, applicable to a number
              of different intellectual tasks,  is a goal of this investigation oriented
              towards the eventual  development of computer systems more consistent with the
              manner in  which users think.
