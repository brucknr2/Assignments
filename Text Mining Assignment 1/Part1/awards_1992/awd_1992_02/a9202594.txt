Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              A joint program to synthesize and characterize novel ternary rare              
              earth-transition metal-nitride materials will be implemented.                  
              Nitrides are the least studied normal valence solids, and their                
              synthesis is complicated by their relatively low free energy of                
              formation, the refractory nature of many and the low decomposition             
              temperatures of others.  Molecular precursors will be used to                  
              synthesize ternary nitrides at low temperatures, thereby                       
              circumventing diffusion problems without the use of high                       
              temperatures and avoiding decomposition of phases with low free                
              energies of formation.  The two PIs bring complementary skills to              
              the problem:  DiSalvo is a solid state chemist and Wolczanski is an            
              inorganic chemist.  Neither PI could carry out the project alone,              
              but together they have all the experimental apparatus and                      
              methodological background to exploit this opportunity under an MS&P            
              grant jointly funded by the Chemistry Division and the Division of             
              Materials Research.
