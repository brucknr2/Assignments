Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                                                                                            
              Pathways of carbon-flow in depositional environments can be                    
              identified using biomarker identities and distributions in                     
              conjunction with compound-specific isotope analyses.  The factors              
              influencing the isotopic composition of individual compounds can be            
              interpreted in terms of known processes affecting bulk organic                 
              matter.  However, this approach is limited and there is a lack of              
              data for individual compounds in modern environments.  This work               
              aims to characterize isotopic consequences of biogeochemical                   
              processes at the molecular level, specifically for those processes             
              associated with the production and degradation of organic matter in            
              the water column.                                                              
                                                                                             
              The ultimate goal is to expand the role of carbon isotopes in                  
              marine and organic geochemical research.  Three efforts towards                
              this goal are proposed.  1) The first is to establish a facility               
              for the isotopic analyses of organic compounds at Pennsylvania                 
              State University.  2) This facility will be used to continue                   
              research started during the P.I.'s graduate studies, specifically,             
              to characterize processes that control the isotopic compositions               
              and distributions of individual compounds.  3) The facility at PSU             
              will be used to foster workshops and iterlaboratory comparisons of             
              irm-GCMS operations and performance.  In addition, it will enable              
              further analytical developments if urn-GCMS and related methods.
