Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  This is an ongoing theoretical study of the dynamics of mid-              
              ocean ridges.  A range of modeling studies will test existing                  
              hypothesis, explore new ones based on existing observations, and               
              make predictions that will suggest new observations.  The primary              
              emphasis will be on spreading center structure and segmentation as             
              well as the exisodic nature of the spreading.  Specific tasks will             
              be studies of convection generated by composional and thermal                  
              buoyancy, 3-D modeling of melt migration, the evolution of ridge               
              geometry, the mechanical factors that control the spacing, dip, and            
              displacement of ridge-parallel normal faults, the importance of                
              strain-rate dependence of viscosity, and an extension of existing              
              of existing 2-D models of the formation of the median valley to                
              three dimensions.
