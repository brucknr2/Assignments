Abstract    :
              This award is for support of a feasibility study to investigate                
              whether the internal layering, as recorded in radar data from the              
              Siple Coast ice streams, can be interpreted to yield information               
              about the transition from normal ice sheet flow to streaming flow              
              in the ice streams.   A methodology for modeling the production                
              and advection of folds in internal layers, using approximations                
              based on steady state analytic models of Whillans and Johnsen                  
              (1983), and on simple geometic numerical modeling will be used.                
              Recently acquired data will be analyzed with the objective of                  
              determining the scale of the processes operating in the                        
              transition zone.  The practicality or feasibility of using the                 
              technique to guide further research will be examined.  If                      
              successful, this approach represents a low-cost means of                       
              investigating the poorly known transition zones of the ice                     
              streams.
