Abstract    :
                   This proposal is submitted to the FY-92 Instrumentation                   
              Competition conducted by the Division of Social and Economic                   
              Science of the National Science Foundation.  It requests support               
              to purchase a computer array for large-scale data processing and               
              numerical analysis required by fourteen research projects.  The                
              Principal Investigators in those projects constitute a multi-                  
              disciplinary User Group from the Departments of Economics,                     
              Sociology and Psychology,  and the School of Public Policy at the              
              University of Chicago,  plus the Population Research Center and                
              Chapin Hall Center for Children at NORC.                                       
                   While the requesting projects represent a range of scientific             
              interests and substantive problems,  they have a unified need for              
              similar algorithms to identify models of individual,  group,  or               
              organ subsystem behavior.  The commonalities can be summarized                 
              under four general headings:                                                   
                                                                                             
                  1.  Linear estimation using large samples;                                 
                  2.  Non-linear function optimization,  often using large files;            
                  3.  Simulation and Monte Carlo estimation;                                 
                  4.  Solution of differential equation systems.                             
                                                                                             
              Importantly,  the computer array itself is an assembly of state-               
              of-the-art components using low-cost technology with natural                   
              extensions to processing power rivaled only by super-computers.                
              Its advantages for social science computing in cost-performance,               
              ease-of-use,  flexibility,  and robustness are unmatched.
