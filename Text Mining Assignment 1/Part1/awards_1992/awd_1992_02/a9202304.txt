Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  The PIs propose to perform detailed analyses of comprehensive             
              optical and radar measurements obtained during CEDAR campaigns at              
              Sondre Stromfjord.  The project's major goals are to elucidate                 
              long-term trends and short-term fluctuations in auroral zone                   
              neutral composition in response to auroral energy deposition.                  
              Current problems in understanding thermopheric photochemistry will             
              be investigated, along with analysis of data using the auroral                 
              electron, photoelectron, photochemistry, and spectral synthesis                
              codes.
