Abstract    :
              The goal of this project is to                                                 
              synthesize and characterize                                                    
              biomaterials for use in the drying                                             
              of gases and organic vapors.  The                                              
              biomaterials will be formulated                                                
              from polymers of glucose (ie.,                                                 
              starch and cellulose) and pentoses                                             
              (ie., xylans and hemicellulose) to                                             
              give a sorbent which is robust,                                                
              biodegradable, and compatible with
