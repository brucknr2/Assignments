Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  The P.I. wishes to analyze the mineral phases of a set of                 
              cumulate gabbros and ultramafics from DSDP Site 334 for major and              
              trace elements with electron and ion microprobe, respectively.                 
              Preliminary calculations suggest that liquids from which these                 
              phases crystallized must have been unusually depleted in Na and Ti             
              but relatively high in Mg.  Strangely, lavas of such compositions              
              have never been found at the Mid-oceanic-ridges.  The proposed                 
              study will provide constraints on the nature and origin of such                
              liquids.
