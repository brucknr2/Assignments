Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              An experimental study of chemical reaction kinetics, and material              
              damage mechanisms, in low energy electron-enhanced etching of                  
              semiconductor surfaces will be conducted.  The general goal is to              
              evaluate low-energy electron-enhanced etching as a damage-free                 
              alternative to Reactive Ion Etching for fabricating nanometer-scale            
              structures.  The pay-offs from this project include: (1) a new,                
              practical low-damage etching process for ultrasmall structures, (2)            
              several in situ techniques for evaluating etch damage during the               
              process, (3) a conceptual bridge from practical etching and                    
              "figure-of-merit" damage evaluation to fundamental materials                   
              properties, which reduces the need for empirical process                       
              development, and (4) a substantial step toward fully integrated                
              fabrication facilities for ultrasmall structures.

              This research is motivated by the practical need for low-damage                
              etching of ultrasmall quantum well structures.  Ion-enhanced plasma            
              etching developed in silicon technology has had very limited                   
              success in this size range, primarily because of ion-induced                   
              damage.  This project is expected to contribute substantially                  
              toward manufacturing capabilites for nanometer-scale devices, and              
              the new technologies enabled by these devices.
