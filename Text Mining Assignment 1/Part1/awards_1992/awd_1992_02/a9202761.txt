Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  This project will fabricate a Phase III array of four                     
              spectrometers which will provide measurements of all emissions with            
              intensities greater than five Rayleighs at solar zenith angles of              
              100o at signal-to-noise ratios greater than ten.  The database                
              which covers the mesosphere and thermosphere will provide an                   
              unprecedented capability to quantitatively test the detailed                   
              physics of thermospheric models of major and minor ion and neutral             
              species and associated thermal structure.
