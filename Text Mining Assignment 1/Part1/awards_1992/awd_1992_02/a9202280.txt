Abstract    :
                   This research is concerned with the study of representations              
              and cohomology of Kac-Moody Lie algebras and quantum groups and                
              their relationship with the geometry of configuration spaces and               
              infinite flag varieties, and some related questions.  The                      
              principal investigator will study the connection between                       
              representations of quantum groups and perverse sheaves in                      
              configuration spaces; cohomology of affine Lie algebras and                    
              cohomology of configuration spaces; vertex operators and                       
              cohomology of affine lie algebras; connections with the geometry               
              of infinite flag spaces; Selberg integrals, the structure                      
              constants of operator algebras in conformal field theory, and                  
              their analogues over finite fields; and higher dimensional                     
              generalizations.                                                               
                   Quantum groups are a new area of research for both                        
              mathematicians and physicists.  On the mathematical side, it                   
              combines three of the oldest areas of "pure" mathematics,                      
              algebra, analysis and geometry, yet it is of great interest to                 
              physicists working on conformal quantum field theory.
