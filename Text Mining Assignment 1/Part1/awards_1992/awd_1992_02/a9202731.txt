Abstract    :
              Humans can produce significant                                                 
              dynamic loads, both while remaining                                            
              in place and moving.  Most building

              public assembly areas such as                                                  
              shopping malls, airport terminals,

              previous studies have defined                                                  
              forces caused by in situ

              research are:  (a) to define the                                               
              dynamic loads generated by                                                     
              activities involving motion such as                                            
              walking and running; and (b) to                                                
              establish the benefits and

              excessive structural response due

              special force platform, with a flat

              will be constructed, instrumented

              of subjects while performing

              to individuals and groups will be

              analysis, and random simulation.                                               
              Simulated results will be compared                                             
              with measured data for small groups                                            
              and design loads will be suggested                                             
              both in time and frequency domains.                                            
              A lightweight test floor system                                                
              will be constructed in the second                                              
              phase of the project.  The dynamic                                             
              characteristics of the floor system                                            
              will be determined experimentally                                              
              and analytically.  The structure                                               
              will be instrumented with a                                                    
              variable damper device.  The
