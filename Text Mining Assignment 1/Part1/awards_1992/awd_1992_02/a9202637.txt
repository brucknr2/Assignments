Abstract    :
              It is proposed to study a novel crystal pulling process and                    
              its application to the manufacturing of a novel optical                        
              material and an advanced electronic material. Czochralski                      
              crystal pulling have been the most widely used process for                     
              producing bulk single crystals of optical and electronic                       
              materials. The proposed process can potentially improve upon                   
              the Czochralski process in that it is self-stabilizing and                     
              operates essentially in steady state, producing single                         
              crystals of more uniform diameter and dopant concentration.                    
              The proposed work will include computer simulations of fluid                   
              flow, heat and mass transfer, and the growth of single                         
              crystals of a non-linear optical organic materials and an                      
              advanced electronic material, InP.
