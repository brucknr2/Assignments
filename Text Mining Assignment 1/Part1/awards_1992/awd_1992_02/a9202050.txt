Abstract    :
                   This awards supports the research of Professor Z. Ran to                  
              work in algebraic geometry.  He will work on deformation theory                
              of varieties, study moduli spaces of polarized varieties as well               
              as questions about properties of projective varieties.  He will                
              also study Hodge theory for holomorphic maps.                                  
                   The research is in the field of algebraic geometry, one of                
              the oldest parts of modern mathematics, but one which blossomed                
              to the point where it has, in the past 10 years, solved problems               
              that have stood for centuries.  Originally, it treated figures                 
              defined in the plane by the simplest of equations, namely                      
              polynomials.  Today, the field uses methods not only from                      
              algebra, but also from analysis and topology, and conversely it                
              is extensively used in those fields.  Moreover, it has proved                  
              itself useful in fields as diverse as physics, theoretical                     
              computer science, cryptography, coding theory and robotics.
