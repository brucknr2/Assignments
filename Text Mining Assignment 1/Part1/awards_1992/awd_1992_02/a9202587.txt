Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              A fundamental investigation of reflection electron energy                      
              loss spectroscopy in conjunction with epitaxial growth will                    
              be conducted.  In situ measurement of core loss ionization                     
              and electron energy loss fine structure will be performed                      
              during thin film growth by molecular beam epitaxy.  These                      
              measurements will enable investigation of surface dynamical                    
              phenomena during growth, such as surface segregation and                       
              relaxation of local order in films at the monolayer level.                     
              Of particular interest are the relation etween cation-anion                    
              flux ration, surface composition and surface reconstruction                    
              for group III-V semiconductor surfaces, and relaxation of                      
              local order at group IV(e.g., Si, Ge, Sn) alloy surfaces.                      
              Development of a data-parallel ultrahigh vacuum                                
              spectrometer will enable increases in data acquisition                         
              speed by approximatel;y 2-3 orders of magnitude.

              This research will investigate a new method for                                
              compositional and stuctural analysis of thin films during                      
              the actual growth process.  Potential benefits include the                     
              ability to achieve atomic level control over thin film                         
              composition, and semiconductor materials with novel                            
              properties and performance for use in advanced electronic                      
              and photonic devices and integrated circuits.
