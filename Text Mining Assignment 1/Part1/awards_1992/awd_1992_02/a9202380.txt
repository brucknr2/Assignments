Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This award from the U.S.-Brazil Cooperative Science                            
              Program supports research in chemistry to be                                   
              conducted by Drs. Jerrold Meinwald and Athula B.                               
              Attygalle of Cornell University and Drs. Gulab N.                              
              Jham and Evaldo F. Vilela of the Universidade                                  
              Federal de Vicosa, Minas Gerais, Brazil.  The                                  
              project will focus on finding an economically viable                           
              and environmentally acceptable method of control for                           
              the control of the moth, Scrobipalpuloides absoluta                            
              (Lepidoptera: Gelechiidae), a serious pest on tomato                           
              Lycopersicon esculentum in Brazil and most other                               
              Latin American Countries.                                                      
                                                                                             
              The project will use the collecting expertise of the                           
              Vicosa group to isolate the sex pheromone of the                               
              female S. absoluta, which is specific to the males                             
              of the same species.  The Cornell group will fully                             
              characterize the active components of the pheromone                            
              and then synthesize quantities sufficient for use as                           
              baits in field trapping experiments in Brazil.  The                            
              collecting and field testing capability of the                                 
              Brazilian team coupled with the analytical and                                 
              synthetic expertise of the US group combine to form                            
              a project not possible for either group working                                
              alone.
