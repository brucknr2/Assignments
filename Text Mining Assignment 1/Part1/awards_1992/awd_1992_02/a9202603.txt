Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              At the Cascadia Margin accretionary prism along the coasts of                  
              Oregon, Washington, and British Columbia, direct measurements of               
              fluid discharge rates from vent sites indicate flow rates 3-6                  
              orders of magnitude greater than those predicted by local porosity             
              reduction in accreting sediments. This award will evaluate two                 
              possible solutions to this discrepancy: fluid migration from depth             
              along a fault zone or near surface seawater recharge due to                    
              density-driven flow. Migration along a fault zone will be evaluated            
              through discharge tests to be performed on boreholes drilled into              
              the accretionary prism by the Ocean Drilling Program. Surface                  
              recharge will be evaluated by measuring in situ permeability around            
              active vents on the margin. The field portion of this project will             
              utilize the research submersible Alvin.
