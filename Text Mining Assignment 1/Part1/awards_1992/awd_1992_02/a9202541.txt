Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This proposal studies the materials which are formed during                    
              the crystallization of polymers dissolved in a supercritical                   
              fluid. Polymers such as linear polyethylene and polypropylene                  
              are completely miscible with toluene under supercritical                       
              conditions. As the mixture is cooled and depressurized,                        
              polymer crystals form in a linked network. The gaseous solvent                 
              is removed by depressurization, leaving the crystalline                        
              network intact. The result is a solvent-free gel or foam of                    
              uniform structure, and with a broad range of porosities and                    
              mechanical strengths which can be varied depending upon the                    
              crystallization conditions. The process has the advantage over                 
              liquid phase crystallization where removal of the solvent                      
              usually destroys the crystalline network. The proposal will                    
              study the mechanical strength and microstructure of these gels                 
              formed from a variety of different polymer precursors,                         
              including polymer blends.
