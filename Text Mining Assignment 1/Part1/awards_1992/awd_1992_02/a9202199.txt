Abstract    :
              Electron cryo-microscopy and image analysis have become                        
              useful tools for determining 3-dimensional structures of                       
              macromolecular assemblies at near atomic resolution.  Our                      
              laboratory is uniquely equipped with a 400 kV electron                         
              microscope funded by the National Center for Research                          
              Resources of NIH as a national facility.  To complement our                    
              NIH support, this proposal is aimed at improving the                           
              specimen preparation procedure,, cryo-specimen holder                          
              performance and data collection on our 400 kV electron cryo-                   
              microscope.  The first half of this proposed technology                        
              development will be carried out in collaboration with Gatan                    
              Inc. to build a carbon cryo-coater for vacuum deposit of a                     
              thin carbon film onto frozen, hydrated specimens, and high                     
              resolution cryo-specimen holder for the JEOL 400 kV electron                   
              microscope.  The performance of this equipment will be                         
              evaluated with a variety of biological specimens under                         
              investigation in our Resources Center.  The final version of                   
              this equipment will become standard products of Gatan.  The                    
              second half of this proposal is to develop software for                        
              capture and analysis of electron diffraction patterns and                      
              images of biological specimens with our newly acquired                         
              1024x1024 slow scan charge-coupled device (CCD) camera.                        
              This software will be made available to the research                           
              community.  These enchanced technologies will be used for                      
              several collaborative and user projects in our NIH supported                   
              Resource Center.
