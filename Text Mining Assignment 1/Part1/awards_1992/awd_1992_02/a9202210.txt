Abstract    :
              ZnSiGeP2  heteroepitaxial films will be grown by chemical beam                 
              epitaxy(CBE), and plasma-assisted CBE; SiO2/Si structures, and                 
              passivated Si reference surfaces will be synthesized by                        
              plasma-assisted processing and wet chemistry techniques for basic              
              investigations of materials synthesis and processing phenomena, and            
              for investigations of nonlinear optical(NLO) effects.  The NLO                 
              studies will be conducted with ZnGeP2  bulk single crystals and                
              ZnSiGeP2  heteroepitaxial films grown on Si, GaP and SiGe/Si                   
              substarates, and at SiO2/Si  surfaces.  These studies are expected             
              to yield basic information relative to NLO mechanisms, and in                  
              particular their dependence on interfacial strain, and interfacial             
              bonding chemistry.  This information will then be used as a basis              
              for the design of device structures, which will then be evaluated              
              for potential applications.

              This research is expected to advance the materials science in                  
              synthesis and processing of novel nonlinear optical materials with             
              enhanced properties.  This information will form the basis for                 
              evaluation of their performance advantages as optoelectronic                   
              circuit elements used in advanced computing, information                       
              processing, and telecommunications.
