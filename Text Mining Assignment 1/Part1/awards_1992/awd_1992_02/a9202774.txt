Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This 3-year study will elucidate the historical response of the                
              lower Great Lakes to nutrient enrichment and abatement, and provide            
              a basis for monitoring changes in trophic state variables in other             
              large, deep-water lakes.  Data collected will calibrate existing               
              proxy indicators to modern conditions and develop new techniques               
              for estimating past, present and future changes in the trophic                 
              state of the Great Lakes.  The field program will include data                 
              collection from the water column, sediment traps and cores from                
              Lake Ontario and Erie.  Laboratory experiments will determine the              
              effects of nutrient enrichment on the carbon and nitrogen isotopic             
              signature of organic matter produced by phytoplankton.
