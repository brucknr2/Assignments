Abstract    :
                   This research concerns scattering theory and, in particular,              
              the study of scattering poles or resonances and nonlinear                      
              diffraction.  The resonances which in a wide range of situations               
              appear as the poles of the meromorphic continuation of the                     
              resolvent of the operator constitute, in some sense, are the                   
              replacement of the discrete spectral data for problems on                      
              noncompact domains.  As in the case of eigenvalues, the link                   
              between the distribution of these poles and the dynamical                      
              properties of the scatterer is of great interest.  Also, this                  
              project supports the study of the regularity of nonlinear waves on             
              domains with diffractive boundaries which represents a natural                 
              continuation of the well understood linear theory.  The main                   
              concern is an accurate description of the location of the                      
              'anomalous' singularities due to nonlinear interaction.  Finally,              
              this project will involve a study of operators arising in solid                
              state physics.  This topic is concerned with the spectral theory               
              rather than the scattering theory but it shares the microlocal                 
              aspects of the scattering theory.                                              
                   This research, in the general area of geometry, involves the              
              behavior of waves and wave fronts together with the spectral                   
              problems motivated by solid-state physics and noncommutative                   
              geometry.
