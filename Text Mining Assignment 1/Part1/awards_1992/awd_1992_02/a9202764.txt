Abstract    :
              In this Experimental Physical Chemistry project sponsored by                   
              the Chemistry Division, Prof. Herschbach (Harvard University)                  
              will construct a new apparatus for electric field alignment of                 
              small molecules in a molecular beam. For the first time, it                    
              will be possible to read the degree of alignment simply from                   
              the spectrum without recourse to complicated photodissociation                 
              techniques. The use of oriented molecular targets in molecular                 
              beam studies of chemical reations will lead to much more                       
              accurate and detailed pictures of gas phase reaction mechanisms.

              Normally, when molecules serve as targets for chemical                         
              reactions, the mutual orientation of the colliding partners is                 
              completely random. Prof. Herschbach (Harvard University) is                    
              developing a general method for orienting the molecules prior                  
              to reaction, and will apply it to elucidating reaction                         
              mechanisms at an unprecedented level of detail.
