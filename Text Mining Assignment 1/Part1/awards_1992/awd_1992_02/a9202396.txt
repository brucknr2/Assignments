Abstract    :
              This project is to continue the development of tools based on                  
              Fractal Geometry for the description, generation and encoding                  
              (compression) of images, using automata-theoretic techniques.                  
              A design system will be developed based on Mutual Recursive                    
              Function Systems which should be specifically suitable for                     
              concise description (design) and efficient generation of                       
              images with a hierarchial structure and which are                              
              characterized by a mixture of order and chaos.  Images of                      
              natural objects typically have both of these properties.                       
                                                                                             
              The main goal is to improve the algorithm for image encoding                   
              (data compression) based on weighted finite automata (WFA).                    
              WFA can simulate wavelet transforms which constitute one of                    
              the best known methods for image compression.  This fact will                  
              be used to design an encoder combining the advantages of both                  
              the fractal approach and the wavelet transforms.                               
                                                                                             
              The theoretical properties of WFA as computers of real                         
              function will also be investigated.  This is a new application                 
              of finite automata with much potential, for example, the                       
              possibility of mechanical integration: an automaton computing                  
              a function of one variable can be converted to one computing                   
              the integral function of f.
