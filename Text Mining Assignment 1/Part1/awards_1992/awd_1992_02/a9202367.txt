Abstract    :
              This award in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic                  
              Program provides support for an investigation in organometallic                
              chemistry by Drs. Richard S. Herrick and Ronald M. Jarret,                     
              Chemistry Department, Holy Cross College.  They will carry out                 
              a number of projects involving four electron donor alkyne                      
              complexes of molybdenum and tungsten bis(dithiocarbamates).                    
              New synthetic methods will be developed for complexes                          
              containing four types of ligands: bis(alkynes), benzynes,                      
              phosphaalkynes, and oxo alkynes.  The compounds will be                        
              characterized primarily by NMR techniques, and particular                      
              attention will be paid to the effect of substituents on the C-C                
              bond.                                                                          
              %%%                                                                            
              Compounds which contain transition metals associated with                      
              carbon-carbon multiple bonds are studied because of their                      
              relevance to catalytic processes.  In this fundamental research                
              project, compounds containing bonds of this type in differect                  
              electronic environments will be prepared and characterized.                    
              The work will be carried out by undergraduate students, and                    
              some high school teachers and students will also be involved.                  
              Thus the work is expected to have both scientific and                          
              educational impact.
