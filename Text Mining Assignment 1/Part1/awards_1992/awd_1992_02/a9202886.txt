Abstract    :
              This focuses on the development of procedures which integrate                  
              modern dynamical systems theory and analytical/numerical                       
              techniques to characterize the dynamical behavior of systems with              
              strong local nonlinearities. The emphasis will be placed on                    
              nonlinearly coupled rotor/structural systems such as high speed                
              aircraft engines. Strong local nonlinearities in rotor systems                 
              are manifested in dampers, clearances, fluid interactions, rubs,               
              and others. The systems may be subjected to single or multi                    
              frequency excitation due to rotating imbalance in single, or                   
              multiple shaft and/or geared systems, respectively. General                    
              procedures will be developed for determining the system's                      
              multiple, periodic and quasi-periodic responses, their detailed                
              bifurcations and routes to chaos.  Low order rotor models will be              
              constructed to study the nonlinear mechanisms by which the                     
              regular and chaotic behavior of the systems influence their                    
              performance. Of particular interest is the effect of internal                  
              resonances on that behavior. The research will yield reliable                  
              methods and procedures which will contribute to the fundamental                
              understanding of nonlinear phenomena in systems with strong                    
              nonlinearities. The methods will be generalized to efficiently                 
              treat large order rotor systems to aid in their simulation,                    
              design, testing and monitoring; and for future developments in                 
              experimental and analytical studies.*** //
