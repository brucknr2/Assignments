Abstract    :
                   The principal investigator will study a variety of problems               
              concerning the qualitative properties of the solutions of partial              
              differential equations which describe nonlinear wave motion.  In               
              particular, an investigation will be made of the propagation of                
              singularities of solutions along caustics and to study linear                  
              inverse hyperbolic problems like determining the speed of sound                
              from information given by the problem.                                         
                   The qualitative analysis of nonlinear waves is of                         
              significant scientific interest in view of their wide spread                   
              occurrence in real world situations.
