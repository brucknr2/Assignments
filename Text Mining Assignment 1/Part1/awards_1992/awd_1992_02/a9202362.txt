Abstract    :
                   This award is to research and develop flexible forming of                 
              sheet metal with the aid of a programmable die, in conjunction with            
              closed loop control of the forming process.  In concept this                   
              implies a sheet metal forming process driven only by the geometric             
              data, as defined by a Computer Aided Design (CAD) system, that can             
              also adapt to part shape changes and material and forming condition            
              uncertainties.  This work will focus on two major issues.  They are            
              (1) fundamental exploration of discrete tool forming mechanics and             
              a concomitant machine design to identify and achieve maximum                   
              forming fidelity, process accuracy and speed, and (2) refinement               
              of the deformation transfer function concept for general                       
              three-dimensional complex sheet metal parts using numerical                    
              simulation and experiments.                                                    
                   The final outcome of this research is the elimination of long             
              set-up and tooling developing times currently associated with the              
              sheet metal forming process.  This will not only reduce time and               
              costs associated with this process but also allow the economical               
              processing of small lot production of complex sheet metal parts.               
              The sheet metal forming process is a major component in the                    
              manufacturing of many durable goods and the results of this                    
              research will enhance the efficiency of that sector of industry.
