Abstract    :
              This award is made by the Office of Special Projects in the                    
              Chemistry Division under the Materials Synthesis and Processing                
              Initiative. The research is a combined experimental and                        
              theoretical effort to understand how the presence of a surface                 
              influences the photochemistry of an adsorbed molecule. Specific                
              objectives are to use experimental measurements and theoretical                
              simulations to understand how the substrate affects the                        
              photodissociation of a bond in an adsorbed molecule and to                     
              investigate how the branching among various reaction pathways                  
              depends on this elementary step.  Experiments will be carried                  
              out on methyl iodide and iodine cyanide, whose gas-phase                       
              photodissociation dynamics are well known, adsorbed on                         
              magnesia, titania and gold, representing an insulator, a                       
              semiconductor, and a metal. Surface analysis, mass                             
              spectrometry, and gas phase laser-based                                        
              spectroscopicmeasurements will be employed to determine the                    
              branching among reaction pathways and the energy content of                    
              photofragments ejected from the surface.

              The scientific issues addressed in the field of surface                        
              photochemistry are broadly relevant to such materials issues as                
              photoassisted deposition, photoresists, surface                                
              photodegradation, photolithography and laser- and                              
              plasma-assisted etching.
