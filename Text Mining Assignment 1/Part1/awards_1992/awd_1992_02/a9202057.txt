Abstract    :
              The goal of this research is to provide a better understanding                 
              of nucleation processes, and to allow us to make accurate                      
              quantitative predictions.  The research will be in three                       
              somewhat different but complementary fields of investigation:                  
              ion induced nucleation, nucleation of metal vapors, and                        
              homogeneous nucleation.  The P. I. has developed a new method                  
              for measuring the ion induced nucleation rate in which all the                 
              important variables (supersaturation, temperature, and ion                     
              density) are accurately known and all can be readily changed.                  
              Initial measurements on n-nonane and 1-hexanol will be                         
              repeated to decrease their uncertainty, optimize conditions                    
              and extend them to a wider range of supersaturations and to                    
              several temperatures.  Studies of more complex substances such                 
              as those with quadropole moments or high polarizabilities                      
              (e.g. CS2, CC14) will also be made.  A second major focus will                 
              be the homogenous nucleation of metal vapors.  Metals in their                 
              dilute vapor state are nonmetallic, resulting in a cluster                     
              size dependence of the nonmetal transition.  Nucleation                        
              studies of metals not only will enable one to study this                       
              phenomena at temperatures far below the critical temperature                   
              (and thus at temperatures where the change in density is                       
              essentially discontinuous), but also will test the validity of                 
              nucleation theories on a class of substances very different                    
              from any studied until now.  The focus will be a joint effort                  
              of this research group and a research group at Phillips                        
              University in Marburg, Germany headed by Prof. F. Hensel and                   
              Dr. H. Uchtmann.  A third focus will be continued efforts on                   
              understanding homogeneous nucleation processes.  This will                     
              include studies on various substances over a wide range of                     
              rates, 10-6 to 101 nuclei cm-3 s-1.  Phase change form vapor to                
              the liquid phase by nucleation plays a key role in a wide                      
              variety.
