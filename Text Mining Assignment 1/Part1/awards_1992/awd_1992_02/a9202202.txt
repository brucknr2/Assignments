Abstract    :
              The research focusses on understanding the composition and                     
              morphology of natural materials and using these findings in                    
              designing and selecting man made materials.  Since natural                     
              materials have developed efficiency through evolution, the                     
              results from the work should lead to development of efficient                  
              microstructural designs for man-made materials.  Novel materials               
              will be fabricated and studies at micro- and macro scales.                     
              Micro-mechanical models will be formulated to describe the                     
              performance of these materials.
