Abstract    :
              The Fellow will use argon methods to date the cessation of                     
              ductile deformation in compressional orogens in an attempt to                  
              make new contributions toward understanding the evolution of                   
              fault systems.  Structural geologists have shown that the locus                
              of deformation migrates in the deforming crust through time.                   
              During different stages of deformation, different parts of the                 
              fault system may be active.  Study will be made of micas that                  
              nucleate and grow during deformation below the temperature of                  
              significant argon loss in order to track this late migration of                
              ductile deformation.  The Fellow will work at the University of                
              California at Los Angeles during the tenure of this fellowship.
