Abstract    :
              This award from the U.S.-Brazil Cooperative Science                            
              Program supports collaborative research in chemistry to                        
              be conducted by Dr. Emile A. Schweikert of Texas A & M                         
              University and a group led by Dr. Carlos V. Barros Leite                       
              of Pontifica Universidade Catolica (PUC) in Rio de                             
              Janeiro, Brazil.  The objective of the research is to                          
              investigate the secondary emission of ions from surfaces                       
              bombarded by MeV energy C60+ ions acting as projectiles.                       
              The secondary emissions will be evaluated for potential                        
              in surface characterization.                                                   
                                                                                             
              Experiments to produce the C60+ beam will be carried out                       
              in the laboratory of the Brazilian team using its Van de                       
              Graaf apparatus, with input on experimental design,                            
              time-of-flight and coincidence counting technology                             
              provided by the U.S. group.  Data work-up and analysis                         
              would be primarily carried out at Texas A & M.  The                            
              experiments will be run on four target materials:                              
              metallic (Au), ionic (CsI), organic (phenylalanine and                         
              bimolecular (gramacidine).  For comparison, the same                           
              emissions with smaller equal velocity projectiles (C+,                         
              C6+, C10+) will be studied.  This project continues                            
              previous collaborative efforts between the two groups                          
              that have resulted in 23 joint publications since 1984.
