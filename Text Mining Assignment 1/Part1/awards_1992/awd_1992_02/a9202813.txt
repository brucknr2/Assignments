              This award from the U.S.- Argentina Cooperative                                
              Science Program supports research in materials                                 
              science to be conducted by Dr. Saul Oseroff of                                 
              San Diego state University and Dr. Manuel Tovar                                
              of the Centro Atomico Bariloche (CAB), Rio                                     
              Negro, Argentina.  The project focuses on the                                  
              study of correlation of the magnetic and                                       
              superconducting properties of doped R2CuO4                                     
              compounds.                                                                     
                                                                                             
              The project centers on the possibility of                                      
              finding a correlation between the appearance of                                
              a weak ferromagnetic component (WF) and loss of                                
              superconductivity in the heavier rare-earth                                    
              cuprates.  Compounds, which when doped with Ce                                 
              or Th, do not become superconductors.  A series                                
              of experiments are proposed including ones                                     
              involving the effects of hydrostatic and axial                                 
              pressure on the magnetic and superconducting                                   
              properties.  The project continues an active and                               
              successful collaboration between two able and                                  
              productive groups.  *** //
