Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The mechanisms by which eddies are generated along coastal boundary            
              by a fluctuating wind stress are studied by means of combined                  
              laboratory experiments and numerical models. Various types of wind             
              forcing and bottom topography will be used in the experiments.
