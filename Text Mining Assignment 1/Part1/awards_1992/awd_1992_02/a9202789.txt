Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                                                                                            
              Radioisotopes of beryllium (10Be and 7Be) and aluminum (26Al) are              
              produced by the interaction of cosmic rays with atoms in the                   
              atmosphere and on the Earth's surface.  They enter the ocean via               
              wet/dry fallout, and in the case of 26Al, via aeolian transport to             
              a certain extent as well.  They have different half-lives.  They               
              and their stable counterparts, 9Be and 27Al, have varied geochemical           
              source functions, behavior, and pathways, yet are linked in some               
              way through isotopic kinships.  Together, they can be used as                  
              powerful time an process tracers for a number of oceanographic and             
              geophysical problems such as marine geochronology, ocean mixing,               
              past and present intensity of dust transport and ocean margin                  
              productivity, and aerosol behavior.                                            
                                                                                             
              The improvement of measurement techniques of these isotopes in                 
              recent years allows the potential of their tracer utility to be                
              explored.  The basic distributional features and geochemical                   
              behavior of 10Be and 9Be in the ocean-atmosphere system has been               
              studied.  This past effort is now extended to the study of 26Al, as            
              data base on this isotope in the ocean borders on virtual non-                 
              existence.  Measurements will be made of 26Al/10Be and 7Be/10Be in             
              seawater, and 26Al/10Be,10Be/9Be and 26Al/27Al in authigenic phases of         
              deep-sea sediments and ferromanganese deposits.  From the                      
              measurement will come: (1) better understanding of the comparative             
              marine geochemistry of 26Al and 10Be, (2) refinement of the                    
              geochronology with 10Be/9Be, (3) evaluation of the absolute dating             
              method of 26Al/10Be, (4) estimation of the input of the land-                  
              originated 26Al to the ocean, and (5) exploration of the possibility           
              of using the isotope systems to trace past variations in ocean                 
              circulation and atmospheric dust transport.
