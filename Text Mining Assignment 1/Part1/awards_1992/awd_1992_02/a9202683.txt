Abstract    :
              A fundamental study to address the feasibility of rare earth doping of         
              semiconductors(III-V, Silicon, and SiGe) for light emitting devices will       
              be conducted.  The approach is to introduce erbium in the form of              
              moleclules of erbium and another impurtiy(oxygen or nitrogen).  This           
              will be achieved by control of growth chemistry and use of novel               
              precursors, which are designed to decompose in sucha a way as to form          
              Er-O and Er-N radicals on the growth surface and be incorporated in this       
              form into the layer.  Capture of carriers by the impurity part of a            
              dopant molecule followed by energy transfer to erbium is expected to           
              provide an efficent excitation route of intra-4f shell luminescence.

              This research will investigate a new method for obtaining light emission       
              from semiconductors.  Potential benefits include the ability to provide        
              novel devices and optical interconnects in high performance electronic         
              and photonic devices and integrated circuits used in computing,                
              information processing, and telecommunications.
