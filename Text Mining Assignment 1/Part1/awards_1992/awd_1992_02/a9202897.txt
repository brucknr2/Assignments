Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  The PIs would like to participate in the next scheduled                   
              airborne and groundbased lidar/radar/optical observations campaign,            
              the ALOHA-93 campaign; and to conduct various  small-scale                     
              organized groundbased campaigns within their laboratory and other              
              US research institutions.  Additionally, the research planned                  
              includes the measurements of OH rotational temperature, gravity                
              wave induced intensity and temperature oscillations, vibrational               
              distribution of OH(2), and correlation studies of mesospheric                 
              nightglow O(1S), O2(1) and OH Meinel band emissions.
