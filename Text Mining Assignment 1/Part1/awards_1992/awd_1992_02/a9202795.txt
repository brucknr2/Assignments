Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  This project will study the electric field variations in the              
              polar cap as a function of the interplanetary medium and the                   
              magnetic substorm activity.  Primarily, the work will center around            
              the Sondrestrom incoherent scatter radar, but will also entail                 
              coincident data from other ground based facilities and satellite               
              instruments.  Two issues the proposal will address are:  (1) the               
              influence that the interplanetary medium has on the polar cap                  
              electric field, and (2) changes in the electric field in and near              
              the polar cap during substorms.
