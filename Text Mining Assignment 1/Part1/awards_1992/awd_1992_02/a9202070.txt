Abstract    :
                   The two aspects of this research focus on semiparametric                  
              regression modeling and the properties of estimators and the                   
              comparative merits of different approaches.  In the context of                 
              survival function analysis, the estimation problem focuses on the              
              information in the censoring distribution and/or the observed                  
              censoring times.  In the industrial context, the problem focuses               
              on describing the behavior of the bootstrap methodology as used                
              in smoothing and in determining conditions under which this is                 
              the superior methodology.                                                      
                   Situations in which statistical models or functions can be                
              described only partially in terms of identified factors or                     
              attributes occur widely.  This project considers applications to               
              data from medical trials and, separately, from industrial                      
              experimentation.  When known features only specify part of the                 
              model, the unexplained part can be described in a number of                    
              different ways.  This proposal seeks to identify the conditions                
              which make each particular choice of methodology are sufficiently              
              superior to make its use important.
