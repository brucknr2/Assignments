Abstract    :
              This award is made in the Special Projects Office of the                       
              Chemistry Division and the Division of Materials Research under                
              the Materials Synthesis and Processing Initiative. The research                
              involves the synthesis and characterization of new phosphorous                 
              and boron-based polymers including poly(phosphadienes),                        
              poly(carbophosphazenes), poly(phosphanitrides),                                
              poly(iminoboranes) and poly(borazene/phosphazenes). Suitable                   
              starting monomers will be prepared. The incorporation of                       
              reactive phosphorous centers either as part of the polymer                     
              backbone or as pendant groups is expected to impart useful                     
              chemical, physical and electrical properties to these                          
              materials. A major objective is to prepare the first examples                  
              of tractable, well-characterized polymers based on the B-N,                    
              P=N, and/or B-N-P-N linkages.                                                  
              %%%                                                                            
              Polymers with unsaturated B-N and P-N bonds may exhibit novel                  
              electronic properties and should be useful as precursors to B-N                
              and P-N ceramic compositions.
