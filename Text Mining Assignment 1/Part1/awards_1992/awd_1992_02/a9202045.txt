Abstract    :
                   This award focuses on theoretical aspects of commutative                  
              algebra and seeks to make use of them to break the logjam of                   
              complexity in several problems of computational algebra.  The                  
              principal investigator will: (a) extend the role of Koszul                     
              homology in the structure theory of Cohen-Macaulay singularities,              
              (b) investigate the structure of algebras of linear type, (c)                  
              examine the equations of Rees algebras of various kinds, (d)                   
              study the invariants and singularities of commuting varieties of               
              Lie algebras and their representations, and (e) exploit some                   
              novel means of converting graph-theoretic data into                            
              ideal-theoretic structures.  Concomitantly, he will investigate                
              roles for the recent discovery of closed formulas for computing                
              radicals, equi-dimensional decompositions and a method to compute              
              normalization that is free of generic projections, with                        
              accompanying algorithms, in the development of                                 
              algebraic/numerical equation solvers.                                          
                   This project is in the general area of commutative algebra                
              and the computer-aided computational aspects of this field.                    
              There is a growing interest in using computers to answer                       
              theoretical questions in algebra and conversely, algebra is quite              
              useful for the development of algorithms.  This project makes                  
              serious use of both the theory and practice of symbolic                        
              calculations to solve real problems in commutative algebra.
