Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This award will provide supplementary support to enable Dr. Paul               
              Berkman of the Ohio State University to conduct collaborative                  
              research with Dr. Yoshio Yoshida for 12 months at the National                 
              Institute of Polar Research in Japan.  Berkman and Yoshida will                
              compare modern and fossil samples of scallops and clams in order               
              to interpret the environmental and sea level variations of Antarctica          
              during the Holocene period.                                                    
                                                                                             
              The shells of modern scallops and clams provide a record of their              
              environmental conditions, reflecting hydrochemical variations                  
              associated with glacial meltwater stream impacts in the nearshore              
              marine environment.  Berkman and Yoshida believe that these same               
              hydrochemical signatures exist in fossil molluscs around Antarctica            
              and can be used to interpret glacial melting and sea level variations          
              in the past.  The team will collect modern and fossil samples of A.            
              colbecki and L. elliptica near Syowa Station, an Antarctic research            
              facility run by the Japan Antarctic Research Expedition, and will              
              analyze the shells back in Japan.  Dr. Miyai's experience in                   
              interpreting Antarctic coastal geomorphology complements Dr.                   
              Berkman's expertise in Antarctic scallops.  Their collaboration will           
              help determine how the Antarctic ice sheets have responded to                  
              changes in the earth's climate for the past 10,000 years and how               
              they have contributed to the changes in seal level throughout the              
              world.
