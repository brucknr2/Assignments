Abstract    :
              In November, 1991 Galeras Volcano in Colombia showed numerous signs            
              of impending eruption, very similar to those of the neighboring                
              volcano Ruiz just before it erupted a few years ago with a loss of             
              over 20,000 lives.  This grant will enable the PI and his student              
              to go to Colombia before any eruption comes and establish a small              
              seismic network on the flanks of the volcano.  They will then try              
              to correlate seismic tremors with specific gas emissions as                    
              determined by COSPEC.  This information about the relationship                 
              between seismicity and gas emission could be very important in                 
              attempts fo predict future eruptions of similar kinds of volcanoes.            
              If no eruption occurs while the PIs are there, local geologists                
              will use the equipment to make measurements when and if it does                
              occur.
