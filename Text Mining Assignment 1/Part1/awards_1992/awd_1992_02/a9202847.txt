Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This project will extend the PI's current investigations on                    
              chemical mediation of seaweed-herbivore and invertebrate-predator              
              interactions to include: (1) complex interactions of prey                      
              nutritional value with chemical and structural prey defenses, (2)              
              an understanding of how larval and spore defenses differ from those            
              of the adult, and why (exposure to different consumers?, increased             
              exposure to UV without adult structures that provide shade?, etc.),            
              and (3) the role of learned aversion by vertebrate versus                      
              invertebrate consumers in affecting both prey and consumer                     
              dynamics.  Because benthic seaweeds and invertebrates play a                   
              trophically and ecologically important role in near-shore                      
              communities and are rich sources of novel secondary metabolites                
              that function as defenses against consumers and have potential                 
              applications as pharmaceuticals, agrochemicals, and growth                     
              regulating substances, understanding how these organisms respond               
              chemically to ecological and environmental threats can provide                 
              fundamental information about how marine systems function, and can             
              suggest strategies for applied uses of marine natural products.
