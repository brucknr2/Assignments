Abstract    :
              This project is an investigation of the dynamics of flux-flow in               
              high-Tc superconducting materials which are of technological and               
              fundamental interest.  Several methods will be employed to study               
              the behavior of flux-flow.  The primary method is the use of a                 
              SQUID magnetometer to measure directly the flux-line movement,                 
              which signals the onset of flux-flow.  By studying the behavior of             
              flux-flow, information about pinning centers and the static                    
              structure of the flux lattice can be obtained.  In addition, the               
              characteristics of flux-flow noise, important for device                       
              applications, will be investigated.
