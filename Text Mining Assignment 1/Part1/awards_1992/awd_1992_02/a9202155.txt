Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This award from the U.S.- Argentina Cooperative                                
              Science Program supports research in biology to                                
              be conducted by Dr. Yun-Fai C. Lau of the                                      
              University of California, San Francisco and Dr.                                
              Nestor O. Bianchi of IMBICE, La Plata,                                         
              Argentina.  The project focuses on the study of                                
              sex determination in Akodon rodents.                                           
                                                                                             
              The project takes advantage of the fact that                                   
              several species of rodents from the Genus                                      
              Akodon in South America possess some peculiar sex                              
              determination mechanisms in which there is a                                   
              disproportion of females harboring both X and Y                                
              chromosomes in their karyotypes.  These rodents                                
              will be studied to investigate the mammalian                                   
              sex determination process and to test the                                      
              involvements of several recently isolated                                      
              candidate genes for the testis determining Y                                   
              (Tdy) locus on the Y chromosome.  The award                                    
              will support a collaborative effort by two                                     
              recognized experts in the field of mammalian                                   
              sex determination.
