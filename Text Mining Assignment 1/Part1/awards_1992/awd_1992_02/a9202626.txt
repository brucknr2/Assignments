Abstract    :
                   Funding will support a one-day symposium entitled, "The                   
              Crisis in Invertebrate Conservation," to be sponsored by the                   
              American Society of Zoologists (ASZ) and held during its 1992                  
              annual meeting in Vancouver, British Columbia in December 1992.                
              At the Vancouver meeting, ASZ will assemble together with the                  
              Canadian Society of Zoologists, providing an international forum.              
              The symposium addresses a growing problem in conservation                      
              biology:  the relatively small attention given to major problems               
              in invertebrate conservation across some 28 phyla and all major                
              earth habitat types.  There will be eleven speakers, each                      
              addressing an urgent topic.  They will discuss the effects of                  
              environmental alteration, pollution, introduced species and over               
              harvesting on many invertebrate phyla from habitats as diverse as              
              coral reefs, temperate rocky coasts, fresh water streams and                   
              lakes, and temperate and tropical forests.  The symposium will                 
              dramatize the crisis to a broad audience, facilitate exchange of               
              ideas, concerns and approaches to dealing with invertebrate                    
              conservation, and stimulate much needed action in the area of                  
              invertebrate conservation biology.
