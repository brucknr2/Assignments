Abstract    :
              The ability to grow metastable epitaxial heterostructures has                  
              driven efforts to fabricate many novel electronic devices.  Recent             
              breakthroughs in the heteroepitaxial growth of silicides such as               
              CoSi2 on the Si(100) surface have revitalized the search for a                 
              metal base transistor; however, many problems remain.  One of the              
              most critical problems at this time is the inability to grow high              
              quality epitaxial Si back on top of these films.  This proposal                
              addresses this goal by taking a scientifically aggressive approach             
              in an attempt to use "kinetic engineering" to overcome the growth              
              problems associated with heteroepitaxy on silicide surfaces.                   
              "Kinetic engineering" is intended here to describe attempts to                 
              alter the kinetics of a nucleating film by modification of the                 
              surface geometric and/or electronic structure. This will be                    
              accomplished by using adsorbates, such as As, as surfactants and               
              controllably altering the surface topography of the substrate.                 
              %%%                                                                            
              This research will result in a better fundamental understanding of             
              the influence adsorbates have on the kinetics and energetics of                
              evolving films in determining the resulting growth mode.  This                 
              understanding will provide a foundation for low temperature                    
              processing of thin film structures with a desired morphology.  This            
              research will provide tools needed for the pursuit of advanced                 
              devices such as the  metal base transistor and the three                       
              dimensional integration of silicon devices.
