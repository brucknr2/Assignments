Abstract    :
                   Gindikin will investigate multidimensional problems in                    
              integral geometry and analysis on affine symmetric spaces.   The               
              first part of this project will be to construct local inversion                
              formulas and to relate them to the representation theory of Lie                
              groups.  The second part of the proposal will consider analysis                
              on homogeneous cones and Siegel domains with an aim towards                    
              developing explicit realizations of results from representation                
              theory, including Plancherel measure and spherical functions.                  
                   The theory of Lie groups, named in honor of the Norwegian                 
              mathematician Sophus Lie, has been one of the major themes in                  
              twentieth century mathematics.  As the mathematical vehicle for                
              exploiting the symmetries inherent in a system, the                            
              representation theory of Lie groups has had a profound impact                  
              upon mathematics itself and theoretical physics, especially                    
              quantum mechanics and elementary particle physics.
