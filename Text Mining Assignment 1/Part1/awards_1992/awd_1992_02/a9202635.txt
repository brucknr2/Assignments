Abstract    :
              This award is made by the Office of Special Projects in the                    
              Chemistry Division under the Materials Synthesis and Processing                
              Initiative. Molecule-sized photovoltaic devices will be                        
              designed  and synthesized using the principles of natural                      
              photosynthesis. These devices will be incorporated into                        
              Langmuir-Blodgett films and self-assembled monolayers on metal                 
              surfaces, and studied using time-resolved optical techniques.                  
              Producing such organized assemblies will overcome low current                  
              yields due to inefficient separation of electrical charge and                  
              injection of charge across interfaces. A scanning                              
              photoelectrochemical microscopy probe will be developed,                       
              capable of measuring the photoelectrical response of small                     
              regions of the films, or even of individual molecules.

              Materials based on monolayer films hold substantial promise for                
              the fabrication of electronic devices in general and                           
              photovoltaics in particular.
