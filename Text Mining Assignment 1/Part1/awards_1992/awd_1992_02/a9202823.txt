Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The primary objective of this doctoral dissertation improvement                
              proposal is to investigate the relationship between habitat                    
              structure and foraging behavior in two howler monkey populations.              
              Recently, many anthropologists have been interested in the ways in             
              which morphology and positional behavior relate.  One application              
              of such information is in the added ability to then interpret the              
              fossil evidence of human and primate evolution.  Here, the PIs will            
              observe two howler monkey populations living in different habitats             
              and with differing dietary options.  The PIs record movement, body             
              postures and vegetational architecture on video for computer                   
              analysis in light of the available food sources.  The results may              
              help elucidate the extent and significance of interpopulational                
              variation in positional behavior as it relates to habitat structure            
              and food sources.
