Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The Gordon Research Conferences are held every summer to discuss               
              the recent findings and current thinking in various areas of                   
              science.  Although participation is limited, the attendees usually             
              consists of established scientists, young investigators who are                
              making important contributions in these research areas and                     
              postdoctoral fellows.  The meetings are held at schools in small               
              isolated New England towns away from other distractions, in and                
              atmosphere conducive to the exchange of ideas.  These conferences              
              have a recognized value for presenting the latest advances in                  
              research and also indicating the future trends which are likely to             
              be most productive.
