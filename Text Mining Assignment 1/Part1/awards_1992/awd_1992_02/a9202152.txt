Abstract    :
              The focus of this research is the development of synthetic                     
              methods for the preparation of novel aromatic compounds                        
              composed of alternating fused benzene and cyclobutadiene rings.                
              Related structures include extended sp-carbon nets and                         
              heterocyclic analogs.  The compounds may show superconducting                  
              behavior and their unique topology makes them viable precursors                
              to novel hydrocarbon cages and related assemblies.  Access to                  
              the compounds will be afforded via transition metal catalysis.

              With this award, the Synthetic Organic Program is supporting                   
              the research of Dr. K. Peter C. Vollhardt of the Department of                 
              Chemistry at the University of California, Berkeley.  Professor                
              Vollhardt will focus his work on the synthesis a new class of                  
              aromatic compounds known as the phenylenes.  These compounds                   
              have interesting theoretical implications, could exhibit                       
              superconductive behavior and will serve as precursors to novel                 
              hydrocarbon cage assemblies.
