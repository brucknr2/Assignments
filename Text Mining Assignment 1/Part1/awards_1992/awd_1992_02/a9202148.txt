Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  To test various models of glacial history in the Gulf of                  
              Maine, this study will use exsiting samples collected during the               
              first two years of an NSF-funded project to investigate possible               
              deglaciation (=warming?) at about 14 ka, the possibility of a                  
              Younger Dryas signal in the record, and evaluate further the                   
              compete hypotheses of ice shelves versus calving embayments in this            
              setting.
