Abstract    :
              Synthesis, processing, and characterization of technologically                 
              important but less developed AlGaP/GaP(As) on GaP and Si1-xCx                  
              alloys on Si will be conducted.  The co-PIs provide a strong                   
              interdisciplinary team with expertise in the key areas of                      
              importance for this project:  gas-source molecular beam epitaxy                
              (MBE), heterojunction bipolar transistors (HBT), and material                  
              characterization.  Hydride-source MBE shall be used for growing the            
              phosphides, and laser- or plasma-assisted gas-source MBE shall be              
              used for growing the Si1-xCx alloys.  Characterization by                      
              structural, optical, and electrical measurements, including HBT's,             
              shall be used to evaluate the materials quality.  The research aims            
              to achieve fundamental understanding of materials growth and                   
              processing, and to contribute to the technology for large-bandgap              
              semiconductors for high-temperature, high-power and                            
              high-performance microelectronic circuits.

              This research is expected to advance the materials science in                  
              synthesis and processing of wide-bandgap materials based on                    
              phosphides and silicon.  They are suitable for applications in                 
              high-temperature microelectronics for operation in adverse                     
              environments, such as in engines; in high-power microelectronic                
              circuits for diverse realms of applications; and in Si-based                   
              high-speed transistors with wide-bandgap emitters.
