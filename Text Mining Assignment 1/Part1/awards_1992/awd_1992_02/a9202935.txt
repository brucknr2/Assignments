Abstract    :
              Albright College is establishing a connection to NSFNET via a                  
              56,000 bits per second line through the PREPnet mid-level network.             
              The connection enhances collaborations of campus scientists with               
              colleagues in fields including chemistry, biology, religion,                   
              English and political science.  This award funds part of the costs             
              for two years.
