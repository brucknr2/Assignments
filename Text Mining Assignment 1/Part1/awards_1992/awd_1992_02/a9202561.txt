Abstract    :
              This is a proposal to refurbish and upgrade an NMR                             
              spectrometer system to be used for high resolution                             
              multinuclear studies of liquids.  The spectrometer will be                     
              used for a wide range of studies including metabolism in                       
              marine invertebrates,  molecular conformation in gramicidin,                   
              and interaction of metals with organic polymers.  A new                        
              magnet will be obtained that has higher field, better                          
              homogeneity, and superior stability than the previous                          
              system.  The spectrometer console will be rebuilt to                           
              accommodate the different resonant frequency of this new                       
              magnet.  This will be a very cost effective way to provide                     
              the required instrumental capacity for these studies.
