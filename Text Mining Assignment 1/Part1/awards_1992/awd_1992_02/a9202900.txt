Abstract    :
              Work will be done on a number of fundamental problems in                       
              several areas of algorithm design and analysis.  Work in three                 
              areas is planned.  First, pattern matching and in particular,                  
              one-dimensional string matching.  A major goal is to obtain                    
              tight bounds on the performance of string matching algorithms                  
              (measured in comparisons).  Second, amortization and the                       
              performance of splay trees.  This effort will be directed                      
              towards making further progress on conjectures relating to                     
              splay trees, conjectures such as the Split Conjecture, the                     
              Traversal Conjecture and the Optimality Conjecture.  Third,                    
              parallel algorithms.  The goal is to obtain work-optimal                       
              algorithms which run as fast as possible.  Future work on two                  
              problems, graph connectivity and Voronoi Diagrams is                           
              described.
