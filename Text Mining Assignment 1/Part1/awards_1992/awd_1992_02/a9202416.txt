Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  Funds are requested to replace the transmitter for the Urbana             
              medium frequency (MF) radar, an important contributor to the study             
              of middle atmosphere dynamics.  A new unit will be computer                    
              controlled, automatically reset after a power failure, and more                
              easily maintained by students.  In addition, funds are also                    
              requested for the purpose of replacing the single existing receiver            
              with four new units.  This work is important because the Urbana                
              radar will contribute to the improved understanding of longitudinal            
              differences in mean winds and tides.
