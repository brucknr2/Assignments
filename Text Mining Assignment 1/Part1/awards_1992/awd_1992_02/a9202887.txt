Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  This investigation seeks to perform theory and data analysis              
              to validate a technique for remotely sensing the density and                   
              temperature of the neutral atmosphere at altitudes between 100 and             
              600 km.  The technique uses ground-based measurements of optical               
              emissions from the atmosphere during twilight conditions, the                  
              electron density is also an important input.  The proposed study               
              will use optical measurements from McDonald Observatory in Texas               
              and radar measurements from nearby sites in New Mexico and                     
              Colorado.  The interpretation of the optical measurements is to be             
              performed with the aid of a computer model called FLIP (Field Line             
              Interhemispheric Plasma) which takes into account the sources and              
              sinks of emissions from atomic oxygen.
