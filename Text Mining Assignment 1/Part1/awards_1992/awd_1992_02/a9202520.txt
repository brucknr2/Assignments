Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This dissertation research project of a cultural anthropologist                
              studies how households use over-the-counter ("non-prescription")               
              medications.  The student will select a sample of households with              
              young children in Tucson, Arizona, which vary on their access to               
              health-care insurance.  The project will study how mothers obtain              
              information about non-prescription drugs, and hypothesizes that                
              uninsured households will rely on OTC medications more than                    
              insured households.  A sample of 40 uninsured and 20 insured                   
              households will be studied over a year to track the illness                    
              episodes.  Pharmacists will be interviewed about their provision               
              of information to customers.                                                   
                                                                                             
              This project is important because the trend in recent years has                
              been to decontrol many previously prescription-only medications.               
              Given the current concern about health care and insurance in our               
              society, this sort of in-depth study of a sample of families will              
              provide valuable information to policy makers about their                      
              situation.
