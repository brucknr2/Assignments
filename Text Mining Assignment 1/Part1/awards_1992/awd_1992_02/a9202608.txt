              Janeiro, Brazil.  The project aims to conduct                                  
              theoretical and experimental studies of                                        
              materials with novel properties synthesized                                    
              under controlled conditions on molecular beam                                  
              epitaxy, e-beam, or sputter deposition on                                      
              crystalline substrates.                                                        
                                                                                             
              The researchers will measure properties of                                     
              binary disordered metallic systems to determine                                
              the degree of ordering, magnetic structure, and                                
              transport parameters as a function of                                          
              composition, growth conditions, layer                                          
              thickness, and thermal treatment.  They will                                   
              also study heteropitaxially stabilized films to                                
              develop stable small gap semiconductors.  Using                                
              self-consistent-field models based on Local                                    
              Density theory in the embedded cluster                                         
              framework, they will probe the electronic                                      
              structure of these materials at the atomic                                     
              level.  Cluster calculations will be used to                                   
              interpret Mossbauer, NMR, Perturbed Angular

              data.  The Brazilian side will produce                                         
              specimens, characterize materials, and make                                    
              spectroscopic measurements.  The U.S. side will                                
              contribute expertise in hyperfine interactions                                 
              and preparation of films.
