Abstract    :
              The primary objective of this work is to establish and ambitious               
              analytical and experimental program to understand and then to                  
              predict the failure mechanics and mechanisms of curved layered                 
              composites. Analytical studies will be directed towards (a)                    
              determining analytical elasticity solutions for the stress                     
              response of uncracked curved composites under general loadings,                
              (b) predicting initial failure modes (interface of matrix                      
              cracking), failure locations based on proper failure criteria                  
              under specific critical loads, (c) determining stress                          
              singularities of curved interface crack between dissimilar                     
              cylindrically orthotopic or anisotropic media and of matrix                    
              cracking impinging on the curved interface. Finite element                     
              studies will then emphasize on (a) developing singular finite                  
              elements to investigate the stress fields near the crack tip                   
              corresponding to each failure mode for test specimens of                       
              practical dimensions. The element formulation will incorporate                 
              proper singular terms obtained from analytical study, (b)                      
              investigating the essential features of failure process in curved              
              composites with emphasis on the role of shell curvature, (c)                   
              determining the mixed-mode fracture parameters K1, K11, and K111               
              in terms of various geometry parameters and loading conditions,                
              (b) predicting fracture models and stable, unstable crack growth               
              or crack arrest. Experimental data will be also used to develop                
              and validate failure criteria as part of the proposed work. The                
              analytical predictions, finite element results and experimental                
              data will be collated and critically compared to provide a full                
              understanding of both the failure behavior of curved composites                
              and the predictive capability of various models.*** //
