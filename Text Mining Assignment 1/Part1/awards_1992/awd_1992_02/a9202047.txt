Abstract    :
                   This award supports research in algebraic K-theory,                       
              particularly with regard to the structure and computability of                 
              the K-theory of varieties with singularities.  The principal                   
              investigator will investigate the relationship between K-theory,               
              etale cohomology and cyclic homology, via the etale chern                      
              character, the cyclotomic trace and secondary chern character.                 
              He also will study the Adams operations on K-theory, with an eye               
              toward vanishing conjectures for motivic cohomology and negative               
              K-groups.                                                                      
                   This research is concerned with algebraic K-theory.  In a                 
              broad sense, algebraic K-theory concerns the evolution of                      
              concepts from linear algebra such as basis and vector space.                   
              This work has significant implications for number theory and                   
              algebraic geometry, and promises to make exciting connections                  
              between a number of different areas in mathematics.
