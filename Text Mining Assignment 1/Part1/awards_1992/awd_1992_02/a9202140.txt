Abstract    :
                   This research project involves the integration of fuzzy set               
              theory with the selective precision synthesis method of optimum                
              mechanism design.  This effort will enable mechanism designers to              
              effectively solve problems that are posed with fuzzy information.              
              Problems dealing with planar and spatial mechanisms with specified             
              fuzzy motion information will be investigated in this project.                 
                   Problems will be formulated as nonlinear optimization problems            
              which will be solved using a modified form of the generalized                  
              reduced gradient method of optimization.  The modification to this             
              optimization method involves its ability to handle fuzzy numbers.              
              This work is important because it will advance the knowledge base              
              in optimum mechanism design in the presence of imprecise data and              
              may open the door for additional engineering applications for the              
              fuzzy set theory.
