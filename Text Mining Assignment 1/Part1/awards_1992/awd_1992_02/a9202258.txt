Abstract    :
                   Interspecific hybridization is common in plants and can have              
              important evolutionary consequences.  Because of its evolutionary              
              significance, hybridization in plants has been the subject of                  
              considerable empirical study at the macroenolutionary level,                   
              particularly in systematics and phylogeny reconstruction.                      
              Although hybridization is the result of microevolutionary                      
              processes, previous studies have not measured the                              
              microevolutionary dynamics of the hybridization process in situ.               
              The primary goal of this research is to conduct a such a study,                
              measuring the genetic, spatial, and gender parameters that                     
              determine the rate of interspecific hybridization and bi-species               
              gene flow in a natural hybrid swarm of Salvia in Southern                      
              California.  The Principal Investigator will obtain these data by              
              using polymorphic genetic markers for paternity analysis, and                  
              identifying pollen parents of seeds set by all individuals in the              
              swarm.  The resultant data will shed light on the                              
              microevolutionary dynamics of this important evolutionary force.
