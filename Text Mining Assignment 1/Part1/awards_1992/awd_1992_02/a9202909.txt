Abstract    :
              In this project, the PI will exploit available ship time on the                
              German research vessel, FS POLARSTERN, to study wintertime                     
              convection and transport in the southeastern Atlantic Ocean, with              
              focus on the Falkland Current, the poleward extension and                      
              anticyclonic return of the Brazil current, and two major fronts of             
              the Antarctic Circumpolar Current during the Austral winter of                 
              1992.  Conductivity, Temperature vs Depth (CTD), oxygen, and                   
              nutrient measurements will be made.  Eight surface drifters will               
              also be deployed to obtain absolute Lagrangian current data for                
              comparison with the hydrographic measurements.
