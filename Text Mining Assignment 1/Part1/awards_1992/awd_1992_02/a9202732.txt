Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Microscopic, photosynthetic plankton are responsible for a                     
              significant portion on the primary productivity in low nutrient                
              ocean waters.  However, these ultraplankton which are present are              
              poorly characterized.  Algae cultured from these populations may               
              not be representative of the actual dominant organisms.  Attempts              
              at describing the structure of deep-water communities by high                  
              performance liquid chromatography, flow cytometry, and electron                
              microscopy have provided some important information, but suffer                
              from quantitative and/or qualitative problems.  This project plans             
              to develop a different method to address the problem of identifying            
              and quantifying photosynthetic ultraplankton by ribosomal RNA-based            
              oligonucleotide probes. Short strands of oligonucleotides                      
              (radiolabelled or fluorescent) which hybridize to specific                     
              ribosomal-RNA sequences will be synthesized.  Because of the                   
              abundance of rRNA in cells, these oligonucleotides can be used to              
              probe mixed populations of whole cells.  Probes specific for                   
              certain orders of green algae (especially the Mamiellales, which               
              are known to be related to some small coccoid phytoplankton) will              
              be produced and tested with a number of coccoid and flagellate                 
              algae.  These probes should allow the enumeration of algae                     
              belonging to specific orders in field samples.
