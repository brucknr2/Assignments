Abstract    :
              Heteroepitaxial interfaces composed of II-VI and III-V compounds               
              will be fabricated under highly controlled conditions by utilizing             
              modular molecular beam(MBE) and chemical beam(CBE) epitaxies in                
              order to investigate the effects of valence mismatch on interfacial            
              structures and physical properties.  The interfacial atomic                    
              structures will be investigated primarily by utilizing high                    
              resolution transmission electron microscopy.  Chemical and                     
              electronic properties of the interfaces will be sutdied by X-ray               
              photoelectron spectroscopy(XPS) and optical spectroscopies.  In-               
              situ spectroscopic studies will be undertaken by integrating                   
              spectroscopy instrumenatation to the MBE system for investigation              
              of local chemical bonding arrangements during real time formation              
              of the heterovalent interfaces.                                                
              %%%                                                                            
              The technological goal of this research involves the development of            
              new innovative optoelectronic and electronic devices consisting of             
              II-VI/III-V heterojunctions, and the integration of newly                      
              developing light emitting devices of wide bandgap II-VI                        
              semiconductiors to existing III-V semiconductor devices as well as             
              the improvement of the electrical contact to these devices.  This              
              research is expected to provide advances in materials understanding            
              and in the synthesis and processing of novel material combinations             
              which will be beneficial to the development of improved devices and            
              integrated circuits used in computing, information processing, and             
              telecommunications.
