Abstract    :
              This is a proposal for funds to purchase a research-grade                      
              light microscope for four projects:  (i) a molecular genetic                   
              analysis of the Drosophila olfactory system; (ii) a                            
              molecular and developmental analysis of the Drosophila E75                     
              gene, a model system for analysis of steroid-triggered                         
              regulatory hierarchies; (iii) a molecular, genetic, and                        
              developmental analysis of the positional control of leaf                       
              cell differentiation in maize; (iv) an analysis of the                         
              developmental regulation and function of the mammalian                         
              transcription factor AP-2.  For each of these projects, a                      
              high-quality light microscope facility is crucial.
