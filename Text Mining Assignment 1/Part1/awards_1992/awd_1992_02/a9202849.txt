Abstract    :
                   Many real replacement problems (e.g. vehicle fleets,                      
              manufacturing machines, pavement segments) face budgets on capital             
              expenditure.  Only a certain level of funding is available for                 
              maintenance and replacement.  Despite the richness of the                      
              replacement literature, there exist few studies which address the              
              effect of capital rationing on replacement decisions.  When budgets            
              are ignored and each asset analyzed separately, capital                        
              expenditures, in aggregate, can fluctuate wildly and substantially             
              exceed yearly budgets constraints.                                             
                   This research studies two environments, with replacement of               
              parallel assets under capital rationing constraints will be                    
              investigated:  (1) with future technological changes, and (2) with             
              Markovian deterioration.  For the latter, both deterministic and               
              stochastic deterioration assumptions will be addressed.  The                   
              approach is to use integer programming for deterministic problems              
              and a combination of integer programming and Markov decision                   
              processes for stochastic problems.
