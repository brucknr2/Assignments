Abstract    :
              The goal of this research is to understnd the fundamental features             
              of ion induced surface reactions in focused ion beam                           
              microfabrication, and of the materials and surfaces that are                   
              produced by the resulting deposition or etching.  This will be                 
              accomplished by bringing to bear expertise from chemical                       
              engineering, materials science, and microfabrication technology.               
              In the case of the deposition, understanding of the basic process              
              is expected to point to ways of eliminating unwanted carbon                    
              impurities, for example, by the addition of a second, appropriately            
              reactive, precursor gas or an atomic beam.  Eliminating or                     
              significantly reducing the impurities in the deposited material                
              would be a major breakthrough.  The reduced resistivity and                    
              increased density would  immediately make focused ion beam device              
              and circuit repair processes more effective and open the door to               
              new applications of maskless, resistless, patterned conductor                  
              deposition by projection ion techniques and to in situ processing.             
              %%%                                                                            
                      Ion induced deposition and ion assisted etching are new                
              processes for material addition and removal.  Since ion beams can              
              be focused to extremely small dimensions (0.05 microns and below),             
              this permits material manipulation with unprecedented resolution               
              and flexibility and has spawned commercial applications in micro-              
              repair of integrated circuits and in microsectioning for fault                 
              diagnosis.  By developing a better understanding of the mechanisms             
              of these new processes, and by extending them to new materials, the            
              proposed research work aims to broaden the applications to the                 
              deposition of the original wiring of future ultrafast integrated               
              circuits.
