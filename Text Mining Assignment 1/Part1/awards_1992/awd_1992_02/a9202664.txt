Abstract    :
              Arizona State University (ASU), in collaboration                               
              with the University of Illinois at Chicago (UIC),                              
              will carry out experimentally intensive, multi-                                
              disciplinary research program on II-VI Compound                                
              Semiconductor-Based Light Emitting Devices.  The                               
              program will emphasize the growth and doping by                                
              molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) and subsequent                                    
              characterization of a novel type of lattice-matched                            
              heterostructure involving quaternary Zn1-                                      
              xMnxSySe1-y confinement and cladding layers and                                
              ZnSzSe1-z active layers.  the new quaternary alloy,                            
              which has not previously been grown, can be lattice                            
              matched to GaAs substrates over a wide range of                                
              band gaps extending from the blue well into the                                
              ultra-violet.  Favorable band offsets are predicted                            
              for this system in both conduction and valence                                 
              bands, based on interpolation of existing data on                              
              Zn1-xMnxSe/ZnSe and ZnSySe1-y/ZnSe                                             
              heterostructures.  True blue and violet lasers and                             
              heterostructure LED's based on defects that plague                             
              existing ZnSySe1-y/ZnSe/Zn1-xCdxSe II-VI laser                                 
              structures.  Ohmic contact layers based on Hg                                  
              compounds will also be investigated to attempt to                              
              solve the currently critical problem of contacting p-                          
              type material.
