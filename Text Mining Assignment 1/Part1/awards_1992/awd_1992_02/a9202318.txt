Abstract    :
                   This award is intended to enable a major improvement in                   
              contour accuracy and surface finish in diamond turning.  This will             
              be carried out by researching and developing a force-tool-surface              
              finish relationship in diamond turning and supplementing the                   
              existing position feedback system of a diamond turning machine with            
              force feedback.  The implementation of a fast tool servo system on             
              the diamond turning machine will enable the system to correct for              
              high-speed spindle vibration.  Further, the fast tool servo system,            
              in combination with the dynamic and static force feedback, will be             
              used to control and improve deterioration in surface finish as the             
              cutting tool wears or vibrates during the turning process.                     
                   Diamond turning is an operation that has a very significant               
              impact on a variety of critical industries including the                       
              manufacture of optical components.  The enhancement of accuracies              
              in the manufacture of optics had reached a plateau and this                    
              research is necessary to achieve accuracies beyond those currently             
              feasible.
