Abstract    :
              The purpose of this research is to undertake a combined                        
              experimental, computational and analytical study that will provide             
              a fundamental understanding, and quantify the nature of, damage and            
              stress redistribution ahead of the crack tip for creep brittle                 
              materials such as ceramics, intermetallics and powder metallurgy               
              alloys, including process zone effects and transient loading                   
              conditions.  It is also proposed to establish appropriate                      
              local/global crack extension criteria for growing creep cracks in              
              creep brittle materials.  Unique granular flow solutions for grain             
              boundary sliding associated with boundary diffusion and/or                     
              viscosity are expected to shed light on appropriate process zone               
              size scales and driving forces for void growth and coalescence/                
              These results will be used to construct appropriate crack tip                  
              damage models to be used with finite element analysis to better                
              understand the physics which will be evident from the experiments.             
              These advances should have important implications for improving                
              failure predictions of components made of creep brittle materials.
