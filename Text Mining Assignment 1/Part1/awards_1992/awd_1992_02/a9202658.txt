Abstract    :
              Application of the coded lone-pulse technique to studies of thermal            
              balance in the ionosphere                                                      
              This project is a collaborative effort involving Geospace Research             
              Inc. and Utah State University.  The research plan has two                     
              components including radar observations of the ionosphere and an               
              associated modeling effort.  Incoherent scatter of radar waves                 
              produces two distinct signals: an ion line and a plasma line.                  
              Usually, radar experiments are performed using either one or the               
              other, but a new technique partly developed by Geospace Research               
              Inc. allows both ion line and plasma line to be measured                       
              simultaneously.  The radar experiments  are to be performed at                 
              Arecibo in Puerto Rico and with the EISCAT facility in Europe.  The            
              resulting data provides a comprehensive set of measurements of the             
              density and thermal properties of the ionospheric plasma.  When                
              combined with modeling, the measurements will be used to study a               
              number of difference processes that affect the observed behavior of            
              the ionosphere.
