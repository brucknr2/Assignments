Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This U.S.-Venezuela award will support                                         
              Professors Christopher Lobb of the University                                  
              of Maryland and Richard Newrock of the                                         
              University of Cincinnati in a research                                         
              collaboration with Professor Miguel Octavio                                    
              of the Instituto Venezolano de Investigaciones                                 
              Cientificas (IVIC).  The purpose of the                                        
              research is to study various theoretical and                                   
              experimental aspects of arrays of Josephson                                    
              junctions.  The investigators plan to perform                                  
              computer simulations of two-dimensional arrays                                 
              of Josephson junctions in order to understand                                  
              the state and dynamic properties of such                                       
              systems, as well as to explore the parameters                                  
              that may affect their performance in potential                                 
              applications.                                                                  
                                                                                             
              Junction arrays have interesting dynamic                                       
              properties and have potential applicability to                                 
              infrared wave detectors, mixers and parametric                                 
              amplifiers, and as emitters of coherent                                        
              radiation.  Measurements and simulations will                                  
              be emphasized in Maryland and Cincinnati, while                                
              the work in Venezuela will emphasize theory and                                
              simulations.  ***  //
