Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This research program is at the interface between materials science            
              and chemistry/biochemistry.  The collaborative research effort is              
              aimed at developing a new type of biomolecular material in which               
              enzymes and other proteins are encapsulated in inorganic glass                 
              matrices synthesized by the sol-gel method at room temperature.                
              Biochemistry is largely a solution-based discipline, but the                   
              application of the sol-gel technique enables us to prepare novel               
              solid-state materials which exhibit the electrical, optical,                   
              chemical and biological properties of the biomolecule as well as               
              the stability and integrity of the inorganic oxide matrix.  The                
              primary objectives of this project are (1) to develop methods of               
              synthesis for this new class of solid-state biomolecular materials,            
              (2) to elucidate the nature of the interactions between the glasses            
              and the biomolecules and (3) to explore applications of these                  
              materials as optically-based biosensors.  The research results are             
              expected to provide a fundamental understanding of the role of                 
              synthesis conditions in retaining the properties of the biomolecule            
              dopant in the solid-state environment.  The optical transparency of            
              the matrix enables us to use spectroscopic methods to characterize             
              the structure, chemical function and activity of the biomolecule               
              dopant.  The work on biosensors is designed to exploit the                     
              specificity of enzymes and other proteins in combination with the              
              transparent, porous and chemically stable matrix of the inorganic              
              oxide.                                                                         
                                                                                             
              This Materials Synthesis and Processing project is jointly funded              
              by the NSF Divisions:  The Division of Materials Research; Division            
              of Molecular and Cellular Biosciences; Division of Chemistry.
