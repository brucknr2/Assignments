Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  Using SEEP II water column data and sedimentary trap samples,             
              the PI's will address specific questions regarding planktonic                  
              production, mortality and downslope transport in the Slope                     
              environment.  These trap samples were collected before, during and             
              after major mesoscale hydrographic events such ad outbreaks of                 
              costal water and intrusion of warm-core rings.  The working                    
              hypothesis is that much of the material that collects on the slope             
              is advected there from shelf water.
