Abstract    :
              The Fellow will attempt to determine the relationships among                   
              orogeny, erosion, and basin sediment accumulation.  Studies will               
              be made in the northern Andean chain of northwest South America,               
              a good place for such studies because of extraordinary                         
              topographic relief, great thicknesses of Neogene foreland                      
              sediments, and Neogene orogenic phases.  Isotopic and fission                  
              track databases are available and will be integrated with data                 
              sets of foreland basin stratigraphy, tectonics, maps and                       
              lithologies, and with original data to be acquired as needed.                  
              The Fellow will work at Cornell during the fellowship tenure                   
              period.
