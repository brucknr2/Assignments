Abstract    :
              Knox College requests funding for a new scanning electron                      
              microscope (SEM) to replace our 14-year-old model that does not                
              meet the current research needs of the faculty, and for which                  
              parts are getting scarce. L. Dybas, principal investigator, will               
              use the SEM for her studies on sipunculan immunology, focussing                
              on the structure and function of sipunculan coelomocytes; on the               
              responses of sipunculans to                                                    
              elevated temperature (heat shock), wounding and regeneration; and              
              for taxonomic and morphologic studies in her research on ptiliid               
              beetles. M. Brodl, in his studies on                                           
              the heat shock response in barley aleurone layers, will use the                
              SEM to characterize the response of the endoplasmic reticulum                  
              during heat shock, recovery, and thermotolerance.  The response                
              in barley is a model system for comparing                                      
              responses in other plants, invertebrates and higher animals.  B.               
              Kooser will use the SEM in his spin label investigations sing                  
              chemically modified silica. EPR spectra display                                
              behavioral changes as the silica surface is modified. SEM                      
              observations of the altered silica are essential to confirm the                
              surface modification. The SEM will also be integral to                         
              an introductory project-based course in electron microscopy.  A                
              research-level SEM will permit students to obtain publication-                 
              quality data either on their own or as co-                                     
              researchers with faculty.
