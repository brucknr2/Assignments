Abstract    :
              A systematic study of the synthesis by molecular beam epitaxy and              
              properties of the alloys of GaAs with the group IV semiconductors,             
              Si and Ge, will be performed.  These alloys are predicted to have              
              direct bandgaps over part of their composition range, and their                
              successful fabrication would open up new avenues for bandgap                   
              engineering in electronic and photonic devices.  The PIs will pool             
              their expertise in molecular beam epitaxy, reflection high-energy              
              electron diffraction, x-ray diffraction, and other characterization            
              methods to correlate growth conditions with structural, electrical             
              and optical properties of (GaAs)(Group IV) alloys and                          
              heterostructures.  The work will also address fundamental                      
              properties of interfaces between GaAs and Si and/or Ge.

              This research will develop a new system of semiconductor materials,            
              formed by alloying gallium arsenide with silicon and/or germanium.             
              Crystal growth conditions for the alloys will be established and               
              optimized using structural, electrical, and optical                            
              characterization of the grown semiconductor layers.  These alloys              
              will allow new flexibility for variation of the wavelength of light            
              produced by photonic devices, and offer the potential for                      
              fabrication of lasers on gallium arsenide substrates which operate             
              at the technologically important wavelengths of 1.3 and 1.5                    
              microns.
