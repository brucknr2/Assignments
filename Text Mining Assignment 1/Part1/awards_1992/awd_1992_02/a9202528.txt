Abstract    :
              Carbon-based fullerene compounds are being investigated by a range             
              of physical characterization techniques.  These include electrical             
              and microwave transport measurements, magnetic susceptibility                  
              measurements and structural investigations using synchrotron                   
              radiation.  These measurements will enhance fundamental                        
              understanding of the physical and structural features that underlie            
              the interesting superconducting and magnetic properties of these               
              materials.
