Abstract    :
              This project, supported by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and                     
              Organometallic Chemistry Program, will explore the synthesis of                
              optically active, tetraaryl porphyrins, which have                             
              conformationally locked, chiral centers on each aryl group, and                
              the utilization of metal complexes of these new prophyrins as                  
              catalysts for several important reactions of organic molecules.                
              The main focus is on the rhodium-porphyrin catalyzed                           
              cyclopropanation of alkenes by diazo esters where preliminary                  
              results with one catalyst that has already been prepared                       
              indicates that there is a high, and unique relative to other                   
              catalysts, diastereoselectivity for formation of the syn                       
              product.  Other reactions to be explored include epoxidation                   
              (manganese catalyst) and the Diels-Alder reaction (aluminum                    
              catalyst).  Another major focus of the work will be an                         
              investigation of the mechanism of the cyclopropanation reaction                
              including the pathway by which the catalyst is deactivated.                    
              Although many catalytic cycles were realized in preliminary                    
              trials, a long lifetime for the catalyst is required for                       
              practical applications because of the high cost of the                         
              synthetic porphyrins.                                                          
              %%%                                                                            
              The focus of this project is the development of new catalysts                  
              for the stereoselective synthesis of organic compounds.  Of                    
              especial interest is the formation of cyclopropanes (three                     
              membered rings) from olefins and diazo esters.  A part of the                  
              study will involve the determination of the manner in which the                
              catalyst promotes the reaction and how the stereochemistry of                  
              the product is determined.
