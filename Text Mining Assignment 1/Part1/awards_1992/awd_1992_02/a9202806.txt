Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              A rich and unique set of observations collected before, during and             
              after the passage of Hurricane Gilbert in the gulf of Mexico was               
              collected in 1998and its analysis is almost completed. The purpose             
              of the study is to better understand the three-dimensional response            
              of the upper ocean to hurricanes in the context of near-inertial               
              wave dynamics. The rate of propagation of vertical energy from the             
              mixed layer into the thermocline is estimated from near-inertial               
              rotating current vectors. The results are also compared with                   
              numerical and analytical models.
