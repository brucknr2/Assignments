Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              New recent work has demonstrated that electric fields can be used              
              to produce phase-separated polymer alloys with unique morphologies.            
              Film casting in electric fields has allowed the production of                  
              samples containing spherical minor phases with controlled                      
              dimensions, spherical minor phases that form "pearl chains" across             
              the sample, ellipsoidal minor phases that form chains across the               
              sample, columnlike minor phases across the sample, and unique                  
              morphologies in mixtures of block copolymers with homopolymers.                
              This work will be extended using anisotropic samples which are                 
              expected to have anisotropic mechanical properties and dielectric              
              constants, for example, when the ordered minor phases are made of              
              conducting polymers, the dielectric constant in the direction of               
              orientation of the minor phases is expected to be exceptionally                
              high.  When the columnlike phases are made of conducting polymers,             
              the samples should exhibit conductivity in only one direction.                 
                                                                                             
              The electrical characteristics of these composites are of                      
              particular interest since it is these properties and the ability to            
              modulate them that lies at the heart of imaging, marking, and                  
              display technologies.
