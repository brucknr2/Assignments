Abstract    :
              The purpose of this work is to                                                 
              develop an effective method for                                                
              controlling the dynamic response of                                            
              large civil structures subjected to                                            
              severe environmental loadings such                                             
              as earthquakes and extreme winds.                                              
              Tuned liquid dampers (TLD) have                                                
              been used as passive systems to                                                
              control motion in tall buildings                                               
              but these are effective only for a                                             
              narrow frequency band.  The project                                            
              will demonstrate that the                                                      
              effectiveness can be enhanced by                                               
              adding an active control.  Two                                                 
              types of active controls will be                                               
              investigated, one, to control the                                              
              tuning of the liquid, the other, to                                            
              control the tank movement by using                                             
              an active support for the TLD.  The                                            
              results of this research can                                                   
              improve substantially the                                                      
              performance of the damping system                                              
              at a low cost, and increase

              structures exposed to natural
