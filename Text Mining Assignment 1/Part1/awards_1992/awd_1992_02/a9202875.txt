Abstract    :
              The objective of this proposal is directed toward                              
              the formation of non-spiking ohmic contacts to                                 
              p-type InP.  It is proposed here to apply the                                  
              principle of solid phase regrowth (SPR) to                                     
              fabricate such contacts to p-InP.  Shallow                                     
              contacts (reaction depth<100A) of mid 107n-                                    
              cm2 contact resistivity have been achieved on n-                               
               and p-type  GaAs by the SPR method.  The                                      
              regrowth process begins with a low-temperature                                 
              reaction between a metal M (e.g. Pd or Ni) and                                 
              a compound semiconductor substrate, AB, to                                     
              produce an intermediate ternary MxABy phase.                                   
              A subsequent reaction at a higher temperature                                  
              between an overlayer of Si, Ge, or In and the                                  
              intermediate phase results in the decomposition                                
              of the intermediate phase and the epitaxial                                    
              regrowth of a layer of the compound                                            
              semiconductor doped or alloyed with the                                        
              overlayer element.  The nonstoichiometry of the                                
              intermediate ternary MxABy phase (i.e. where y                                 
              is not equal to 1) will allow the doping element                               
              to occupy the preferential sites (site selection                               
              mechanism), thus forming a highly doped                                        
              surface regrown layer.  A thin layer of doping                                 
              element (i.e. Mg, Mn, Si, or Ge) imbedded in                                   
              metal M has been used to successfully                                          
              intentionally dope the regrowth layer to reduce                                
              the contact resistivity significantly.  In this                                
              project, the Pd- and Ni-based contact system                                   
              will be investigated since ternary compounds                                   
              such as Pd4.8InP and Ni2.7InP have been observed                               
              between Pd, Ni and InP at low temperatures.                                    
              Overlayers of Ge, Si, In or Sb will be                                         
              investigated to drive the decomposition of the                                 
              Pd (or Ni) ternary compounds and the epitaxial                                 
              regrowth of Inp. The effects of a thin layer of                                
              embedded acceptor element on the electrical                                    
              characteristics (i.e. Mn, Mg, or Zn) will be                                   
              carried out.  In this research cross-sectional                                 
              transmission electron microscopy and backside                                  
              secondary ion mass spectrometry will be used                                   
              for structural investigation, and Transmission                                 
              Line Model measurements will be utilized for                                   
              electrical measurement.  The SPR contacts are                                  
              expected to provide more uniform interfaces and                                
              lower contact resistivity compared to.
