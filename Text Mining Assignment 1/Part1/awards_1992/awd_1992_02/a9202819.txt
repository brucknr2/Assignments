Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                                                                                             
                                                                                            
              The ratio of Ge/Si in biogenic opal has enormous potential as a                
              tracer of the balance between chemical fluxes from continental                 
              weathering and hydrothermal sources and as a tracer of oceanic                 
              processes such as productivity.  However, the degree to which this             
              tracer can be successfully applied to these problems critically                
              depends on the mass-balance of the Ge-Si system and the chemical               
              behavior of these two elements in the oceans.  It appears that the             
              current understanding of the Ge-Si system is incomplete since                  
              estimates of the hydrothermal Si flux based on the Ge-Si system are            
              much less than fluxes estimated from other tracers or models.  The             
              difficulty with current models of the Ge-Si system is that they do             
              not account for the probability that the marine geochemical cycle              
              for the Ge includes significant sinks other than biogenic opal.  A             
              series of experiments will be conducted to evaluate the flux of                
              oceanic Ge to nonbiogenic sediment components.  The Ge content and             
              key Ge/element ratios will be characterized in eolian source                   
              materials as well as in North Pacific pelagic sediments.  The                  
              results should provide important constraints on the accumulation               
              rate of nonbiogenic Ge in the oxic pelagic environment.
