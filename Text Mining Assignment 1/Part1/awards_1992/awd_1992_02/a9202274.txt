Abstract    :
              In this project, the PI will study the response of the upper ocean             
              to strong wind-forcing in the presence of mesoscale fronts and                 
              eddies in the ocean.  A three-dimensional model will be                        
              implemented to test the hypothesis that the mechanism of radiation             
              of internal-inertial waves out of the surface frontal zone has a               
              larger impact on the variability of surface inertial currents than             
              does modified Ekman transport.  Data from a recent experiment                  
              called the Frontal Air-Sea INteraction EXperiment (FASINEX) will               
              be used to verify the model results.
