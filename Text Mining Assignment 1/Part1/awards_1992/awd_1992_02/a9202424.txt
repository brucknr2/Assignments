Abstract    :
              This is a Small Grants for Exploratory Research (SGER) effort.                 
              The work is a pilot experiment to determine the feasibility of                 
              using a virtual reality environment with a scanning tunneling                  
              microscope (STM) for real-time viewing and manipulation of atoms               
              and molecules.  Recent advances make it possible to link a STM to              
              force feedback and head-mounted display system for new types of                
              scientific instruments.  These instruments will give the user the              
              subjective experience of presence at the atomic scale on a                     
              physical surface. Scanning can be at video rates for real-time                 
              visualization.  Force feedback provides the capability for                     
              tactile exploration of the contours of the electronic environment              
              presented at the atomic, molecular and substrate surfaces.  Atoms              
              and molecular fragments can be manipulated interactively with the              
              probe.  The same probe can cut molecular bonds and bring                       
              fragments together for reactions. The products of resulting                    
              reactions can be explored to determine their morphology and other              
              characteristics.  The STM collaborators are Dr. R. Stanley                     
              William and graduate students from the Chemistry Department of                 
              UCLA.
