Abstract    :
                   The principal investigator will work on a broad class of                  
              problems from nonlinear control theory, including local and                    
              global controllability, observability, and minimal realizations.               
              Special emphasis will be placed on nonlinear stabilization and                 
              nonholonomic motion planning.                                                  
                   The techniques of nonlinear control have many practical                   
              applications from robotics to landing a space probe on some                    
              distant planet.  It is one example of the power and applicability              
              of nonlinear mathematics in the modern world.
