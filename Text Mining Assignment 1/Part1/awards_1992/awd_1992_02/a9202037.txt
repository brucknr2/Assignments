Abstract    :
              Presently, there is no single solid                                            
              state device which generates                                                   
              moderate amounts of low noise                                                  
              power, and can be used in receivers                                            
              as a local oscillator source over                                              
              the 200-300 GHz range.  However, we                                            
              propose a novel Transferred                                                    
              Electron Device (TED) termed the                                               
              Modulated Impurity Concentration                                               
              Transferred Electron Device                                                    
              (MICTED) that is expected to                                                   
              generate milliwatts of power up to                                             
              300 GHz.  The MICTED differs from                                              
              conventional TEDs by incorporating                                             
              a modulated doping profile which                                               
              substantially increases the                                                    
              harmonic content in the current                                                
              waveform.  The increased harmonic                                              
              content of the MICTED leads to                                                 
              second and third harmonic                                                      
              Transferred Electron Oscillators                                               
              (TEOs) which deliver more power                                                
              than TEOs using conventional TEDs.                                             
              This study will assess the merits                                              
              of the MICTED as a solid state                                                 
              oscillator source between 100 and                                              
              300 GHz, and involve device theory                                             
              and design, device fabrication and                                             
              testing, and device simulation.                                                
              The MICTED is expected to have a                                               
              significant impact on millimeter                                               
              wave research where low noise and                                              
              moderate power local oscillator                                                
              sources are in great need.

              harmonic balance calculations.
