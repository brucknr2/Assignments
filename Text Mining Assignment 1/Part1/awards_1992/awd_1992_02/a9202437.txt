Abstract    :
              This collaborative award is made in the Special Projects Office                
              of the Chemistry Division and the Chemical and Thermal Systems                 
              Division under the Materials Synthesis and Processing                          
              Initiative. The research will be directed towards developing a                 
              CVD silicon nitride film process which will proceed at                         
              temperatures as low as 450 C, i.e temperatures where aluminum                  
              connections are not adversely affected. Kinetics of the                        
              elementary reactions, e.g. silylene intermediates with ammonia,                
              leading to gas phase Si-N bond formation under CVD conditions                  
              will be studied. The catalytic effect of free radical                          
              precursors on the formation of silicon nitride films from                      
              diethylsilane and ammonia will also be explored.                               
              %%%                                                                            
              The development of a low temperature process for depositing                    
              clean silicon nitride films will permit the capping of                         
              microelectronic devices using aluminum interconnects. Currently                
              used low temperature plasma enhanced CVD processes produce poor                
              quality films.
