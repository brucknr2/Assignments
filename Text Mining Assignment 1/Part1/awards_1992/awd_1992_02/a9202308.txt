Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              A new materials processing system is used to rapidly solidify                  
              liquid metal from an undercooled state.  This facility incorporates            
              electromagnetic levitation and free fall in a drop tube with rapid             
              solidification by melt spinning in an ultrahigh vacuum environment.            
              A set of titanium/rare-earth alloys has been selected for study                
              because previous research has demonstrated significant                         
              microstructural improvement after rapid solidification from a deep             
              undercooled condition.  The experimental method consists of three              
              phases: (1) materials evaluation; (2) undercooling and recalescence            
              modeling; and (3) ultra-rapid quench processing with consolidation             
              into bulk samples.  Scanning and transmission electron microscopy              
              are used to characterize the samples.                                          
              %%%                                                                            
              This undercool-rapid quench processing system could be scaled up               
              for commercialization.  This research should permit the evaluation             
              of the benefits of the process for a series of titanium alloys, as             
              well as supplying scientific information on the process.
