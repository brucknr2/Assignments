Abstract    :
              The second order differential equations of motion governing the                
              vibrations of a linear, viscously damped, discrete system are                  
              generally mutually coupled. The damping is said to be classical                
              if and only if the equations of motion can be uncoupled by an                  
              undamped modal expansion. This proposal examines the problem, for              
              the case when the viscous damping is nonclassical, of how best to              
              uncouple and solve the governing equations of motion by                        
              approximation, with a real-valued coordinate transformation. It                
              is proposed that the matrix equation of motion, with its mass                  
              matrix transformed to a unit matrix, be transformed by an                      
              orthogonal coordinate transformation to a new generalized                      
              coordinate system in which the bound on the norm of the error                  
              introduced in the response by discarding all the coupling terms                
              is a minimum. A trial evaluation of this method is                             
              computationally effective for solving certain types of                         
              nonclassically damped systems. The proposal describes the general              
              approach and delineates the research plans for a comprehensive                 
              study of the proposed method. The proposed method has application              
              to large, multi-degree-of-freedom vibration problems in
