Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Clark College is a two-year community college which has established            
              a connection to NSFNET via a 56,000 bits per second line through               
              the NorthWestNet mid-level network.  The connection enables the                
              school's faculty and students to communicate and collaborate with              
              the national scientific and educational community, and to access               
              network resources. Areas of science and education addressed over               
              the Internet by Clark include forensic anthropology, atmospheric               
              physics, education for the disabled, biology, mathematics,                     
              chemistry and computer science.  The library also benefits from                
              access to other libraries and data bases.  This award funds part of            
              the costs for two years.***
