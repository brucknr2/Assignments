Abstract    :
              The Evolution of Terrestrial Ecosystems computerized Database is               
              designed to allow broad-scale comparisons of the paleobiology and              
              paleoecology of terrestrial ecosystems and their plant and animal              
              communities.  In particular, research interest in this project                 
              focuses on making detailed comparisons on a locality-by-locality               
              basis of paleocommunity structure, paleovegetation, and                        
              paleoenvironments, and on tracing patterns in biological                       
              structural change in terrestrial ecosystems throughout geologic                
              time.  Such studies require the synthesis of large amounts of                  
              information currently scattered throughout a vast literature or                
              lying unpublished in museum collections, and are difficult to                  
              undertake using the available information resources within                     
              paleontology.  The current award will support the purchase of new              
              hardware and modifications in existing software.  The specific                 
              goal is to migrate the project to a more standard version of UNIX              
              running on a modern, high-performance workstation and to re-write              
              the Graphical User Interface to be compatible with X Windows                   
              standards.  This will immediately allow increased performance and              
              functionality at sites were the database is currently being                    
              compiled and used (the Smithsonian and UCSB).  It will also allow              
              access to the database by multiple users on a wide variety of                  
              remote computers.
