Abstract    :
              The goals of the proposed research are to                                      
              develop key technologies in the fields of                                      
              epitaxial growth of low-dimensional                                            
              nanostructures by molecular beam epitaxy and                                   
              materials processing to make possible the                                      
              fabrication and characterization of functional                                 
              nanodevices with dimensions smaller than                                       
              existing devices.  It is expected that this                                    
              dimensionality will lead to the observation of                                 
              new quantum and ballistic effects which will in                                
              turn lead to novel devices with higher                                         
              performance and operation above liquid                                         
              nitrogen temperatures.  It is our vision that the                              
              completion of this research should lead to 1)                                  
              new insight into innovative growth and regrowth                                
              methods, 2) new insight into characterizing                                    
              ultra-small heterolayers and interfaces 3) more                                
              advanced nanofabrication technologies, 4) an                                   
              understanding of new physical effects in                                       
              nanoscale structures and devices, 5) improved                                  
              and innovative nanodevices.
