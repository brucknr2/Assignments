Abstract    :
                   Continued improvements in integrated circuit (IC) performance,            
              circuit density, and production costs are possible as a result of              
              significant advances in VLSI and optical lithography.  The research            
              program, will capitalize on these developments and develop                     
              innovative and timely technology used in manufacturing                         
              semiconductor components, in particular the next generation of 16              
              Mbit and 64 Mbit DRAM chips.  This will be accomplished by                     
              utilizing new, deep UV excimer laser steppers and taking advantage             
              of powerful and cost effective advanced computer-aided design (CAD)            
              tools for simulation in the overall microelectronics                           
              product-developed process.   In the first phase of this project,               
              the manufacturing yield will be improved by modifying mask                     
              information based upon simulation and fabrication of structures                
              using I-line wavelength verification.  Such a feedback process will            
              allow "dynamic" modification of the layout "design rules" in a VLSI            
              system design, resulting in improved manufacturing yield when                  
              compared with presently available "static" design rules.   A                   
              second, concurrent phase of the project seeks to implement and test            
              simulation models based on advanced KrF excimer laser sources                  
              needed for the development  of prototype 64 Mbit DRAM products.                
              Interactive engineering tests will be performed at the university              
              and in industry to define the optimum operating range and control              
              methodology for excimer laser-based photolithographic light                    
              sources.                                                                       
                   The work will allow the production of integrated circuits of              
              increased density, complexity and reliability.
