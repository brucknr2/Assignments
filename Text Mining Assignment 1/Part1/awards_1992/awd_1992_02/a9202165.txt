Abstract    :
              Research will develop mechanics modeling of failure in metal                   
              interconnects in very large-scale integrated circuits.  A unified              
              approach to diffusive void growth caused by thermal stress and                 
              electromigration and their combination is proposed, incorporating              
              grain boundary diffusion driven concurrently by stress and                     
              electric current, and governing equations for stress and current               
              density distributions.  The primary goal would be to model void                
              growth and thereby predict the lifetime of interconnects.
