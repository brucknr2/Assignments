Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The CCCO will continue to oversee and coordinate scientific                    
              planning for two important oceanographic components of the world               
              Climate Research Program (WCRP) -- the World Ocean Circulation                 
              Experiment (WOCE) and the Studies of Interannual Variability in                
              the Tropical Ocean and the Global Atmosphere (TOGA). The CCCO                  
              will increase its interaction with the ICSU/WMO Joint Scientific               
              Committee for the WCRP in order to develop more effective                      
              cooperation between oceanographers and meteorologists involved in              
              the WCRP, in particular to establish a basis for truly joint                   
              efforts under the WCRP's Global Energy and Water Cycle Experiment              
              (GEWEX) now being planned.  Staff services will continue to be                 
              provided to the CCCO into 1992.
