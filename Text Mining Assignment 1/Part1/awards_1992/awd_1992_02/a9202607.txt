Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This project equips the new Economic Science Laboratory (ESL).                 
              The laboratory consists of 40 subject decision stations, which                 
              under this project, would be equipped with 32 model 386 personal               
              computers and 8 NeXT UNIX work stations plus support units and                 
              equipment.  In the last decade ESL has been instrumental in the                
              development of software programs for the design of new "Smart"                 
              computer assisted auctions for network and other technologically               
              complex coordination markets.  The applications include natural                
              gas pipeline networks, electric power networks, and combinatorial              
              resource packaging for airport slots, timber rights, scheduling                
              problems, radio/TV spectra licenses, and many more.                            
                                                                                             
              The next generation of computer based experimental market designs              
              will require human decision makers at each station to be                       
              supported by expert systems for data analysis, optimization, and               
              strategic analysis.  Development and exploration planning and                  
              programming in this direction has already begun at ESL using two               
              workstations acquired on loans.  Computerized experimental                     
              projects include: private and common value auctions; oligopoly                 
              competition; markets for emission permits; financial market                    
              designs; individual decision making and markets; bargaining;                   
              neural models of adaptive behavior; public goods; marketing and                
              laboratory experimentation.
