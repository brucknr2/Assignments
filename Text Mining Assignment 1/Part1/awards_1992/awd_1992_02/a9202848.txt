Abstract    :
              A novel variation of the Heck palladium catalyzed                              
              intramolecular coupling of a vinyl halide with an alkene will                  
              be developed for construction of a variety of nitrogen                         
              heterocycles.  The process allows concurrent formation of a C-C                
              and a C-N bond, producing a bicyclic ring system.  The basic                   
              methodology will be explored further and then applied in                       
              concise syntheses of the Lycopodium alkaloid phlegmarine and                   
              the spirocyclic alkaloid perhydrohistrionicotoxin.  The                        
              chemistry will also be extended to allow formation of two new                  
              C-C bonds, leading to a range of carbocyclic systems.  This                    
              methodological variation will be applied to construction of the                
              pseudoguaiane ring system and will be a key step in total                      
              syntheses of the magellanine/paniculatin group of Lycopodium                   
              alkaloids as well as the spirocyclic sesquiterpene                             
              beta-chamigrene.

              With this award, the Organic Synthesis Program will support the                
              research of Dr. Steven M. Weinreb at Pennsylvania State                        
              University.  The research explores new ramifications and                       
              applications of a new palladium catalyzed reaction to construct                
              complex structures by new synthetic methodology that should                    
              benefit research in biochemistry and medicine, as well as in                   
              the chemical industry.
