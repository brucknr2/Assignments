Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This project is for a program of macrozooplankton sampling to be               
              conducted monthly as part of the regular JGOFS sampling at the                 
              Bermuda Atlantic Time Series (BATS) station in the Sargasso Sea. At            
              present no zooplankton sampling is included in the Time Series                 
              cruises, despite the importance of macrozooplankton grazers in the             
              packaging and transporting of primary production out of the mixed              
              layer. The monthly (or more frequent) samples over a three year                
              period will provide valuable supporting data on seasonal                       
              distribution for other concurrent work on vertical migration of                
              zooplankton. It would produce a long term data set on zooplankton              
              abundance as a context for intensive process-oriented studies. By              
              providing a significant missing piece of the JGOFS sampling regime,            
              it will permit monthly estimation of the role of zooplankton                   
              grazing, metabolism and migration in regulating the transformation             
              of primary production to particle flux.
