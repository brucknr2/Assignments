Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This U.S.-Brazil Cooperative Science award will                                
              support the collaboration of Larry Mitchell of                                 
              Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State                                       
              University and J. Roberto F. Arruda of the                                     
              Universidade Estadual de Campinas in Brazil.                                   
              The project aims to investigate the use of                                     
              spatially dense experimental response data to                                  
              update the finite element (FE) model describing                                
              that same structure.                                                           
                                                                                             
              The researchers will use a unique scanning                                     
              Laser Doppler Velocimeter (LDV) to measure a                                   
              response image at up to over 65,000 points on                                  
              the structure, in order to develop spatial-                                    
              domain techniques for LDV data reduction and                                   
              modal parameter extraction.  These methods will                                
              be used to update the FE model so that its                                     
              predictions more closely match the measured                                    
              data.  This work will, for the first time,                                     
              allow spatially detailed experimental data to                                  
              help define defects in the FE models and                                       
              provide a basis for spatial-intensive data to                                  
              be used to extract experimentally based modal                                  
              parameters.  The U.S. side has a laser facility                                
              and experimental measurement expertise in a                                    
              modal test scenario.  The Brazil group has                                     
              capabilities in applying FE methods to dynamic                                 
              structural modeling and experimental modal                                     
              testing experience.  ***//
