Abstract    :
              9202835  Jaffe  An aerial vibrating probe will be developed to map and measure
              standing  surface voltage gradients (maintained by subsurface currents) in 
              various aerial organisms such as higher plants, aerial fungi and insect  eggs. 
              the instrumentation will be made available to users throughout  the country for
              biological research.
