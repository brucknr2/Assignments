Abstract    :
                   This project consists of two components: a) the use of                    
              reaction-diffusion equations in the study of natural selection                 
              and diffusion in simple genetic populations, and b) the                        
              distribution of charged ions in solvents under the influence of                
              electric fields in electrochemistry.                                           
                   The evolutionary part extends Fisher's classical model in                 
              population genetics by allowing the fitness of the individuals                 
              and the population size to vary.  Consequently, a number of                    
              mathematical complications arise; e.g., the resulting system of                
              equations does not have a maximum principle.  This, and other                  
              technical issues will be addressed in this research.
