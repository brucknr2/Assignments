Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              An along axis profile of 3-D magnetic inversions for the Mid-                  
              Atlantic Ridge 31 to 35 degrees south, show low magnetization at               
              the mid-segments and high magnetizations at the segment tips for               
              three adjacent spreading segments.  The project will measure rock              
              magnetic properties to determine if the calculated axial                       
              magnetization low at the mid-segment, and the segment tip highs,               
              result from thickened crust with weakly magnetized sources, average            
              crustal thickness and magnetic strength, or normal magnetization               
              but thinned crust.  With the rock magnetic data and the finer scale            
              3-D inversions, the questions of to what extent the hypothesized               
              mantle plume depress magnetization amplitudes, and are slow                    
              spreading centers near discontinuities strongly magnetized because             
              of fractionation processes, will be addressed.
