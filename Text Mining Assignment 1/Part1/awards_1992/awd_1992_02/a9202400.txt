Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  This proposal investigates an extended longitudinal chain of              
              high-latitude HF radars in order to obtain global-scale coverage of            
              high-latitude ionospheric convection and related phenomena.  This              
              chain will provide continuous, two-dimensional observations of                 
              high-latitude plasma convection within a field of view that will               
              eventually extend over as much as 14 hours of magnetic local time              
              and 65o to 85o in invariant latitude.  The SuperDARN network                   
              consists of four pairs of radars sited at five locations extending             
              from Alaska to Finland; this proposal will study the first of these            
              pairs.  This network will provide insight to studies in large-scale            
              structure and dynamical evolution of the high-latitude ionospheric             
              convection pattern and its effects on the structure and dynamics of            
              the upper atmosphere.  Further, the network will aid in studying               
              global distribution and transport of high latitude ionospheric                 
              irregularities as well as the large-scale distribution and                     
              propagation gravity waves excited by high-latitude sources.
