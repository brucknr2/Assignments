Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This action is provide travel fellowships to young American                    
              scientists to attend the 2nd International Symposium on Brain-Gut              
              Interactions to be held in Cambridge England.  State-of-the-art                
              lectures will be held on: (1) neuroanatomical basis of brain-gut               
              interactions; (2) neuroendocrine modulation of afferent and                    
              efferent pathways; (3) sensory-motor interactions occurring in                 
              the enteric nervous system; and (4) interplay between the neural               
              and immune systems.   These are fundamentally important questions              
              in an field that is rapidly advancing and changing.  This symposium            
              offers a forum for interactions of some of the most brilliant                  
              investigators with young scientists from all over the world.  The              
              sharing of ideas on this subject may lead to new experimental                  
              approaches which could be used to elucidate underlying basic                   
              mechanisms which, in turn, could provide a better understanding of             
              gastrointestinal malfunctions.  A reference book will be published             
              of the proceedings to provide an integrated review on the                      
              neuroanatomy, neuropharmacology, neurophysiology and                           
              pathophysiology of brain-gut interactions.
