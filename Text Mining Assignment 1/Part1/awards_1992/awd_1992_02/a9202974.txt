Abstract    :
              The Fellow will make an integrated structural, petrologic, and                 
              geochronologic study of major structural discontinuities in the                
              Grenville Province of eastern North America.  Orogenic cores will              
              be examined to decipher progressive development of ductile                     
              fabrics especially with reference to porphyroblast growth, the                 
              kinematic evolution of shear zones, and the development of fault               
              zones at their deepest levels.  Use will be made of isotopic                   
              analysis of Sa (samarium) and Nd (neodymium) for radiometric                   
              geochronology.  The Fellow will spend his fellowship tenure at                 
              the University of Michigan.
