              composite materials that are                                                   
              processed at high-temperatures                                                 
              (>1000oC).  Specifically, novel                                                
              optical fibers will be used for two                                            
              types of in-situ measurements:

              sensors will be synthesized with                                               
              rare-earth dopants that will permit

              temperature and strain sensors that                                            
              are developed will be incorporated

              more importantly, they will make it
