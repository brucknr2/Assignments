Abstract    :
              The objective is the development of a cost-effective dynamic                   
              monitoring system for steel bridges and other steel structures                 
              with permanently instrumented sensors and computer integrated                  
              signal processing techniques.  The theoretical basis of this                   
              monitoring system is the "Vibrational Signatures Analysis:.  In                
              addition to hardware and software development, this monitoring                 
              system will be implemented on a 2/5 scale five story steel                     
              structure and a 1/6 scale model bridge cooperatively with the NY               
              State DOT.  These two tasks are designed to evaluate the                       
              effectiveness of the proposed system subject to a variety of                   
              loading and environmental conditions. //
