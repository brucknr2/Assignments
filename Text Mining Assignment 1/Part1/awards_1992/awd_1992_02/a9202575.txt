Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                                                                                             
                                                                                            
              Chemical vapor deposition (CVD) methods have become important                  
              for the manufacture of technologically-significant thin films.                 
              Many important materials are synthesized by this general                       
              family of techniques, including semiconducting and insulating                  
              films, and diamond films for wear hardening and optical uses.                  
                                                                                             
              This project is a multidisciplinary collaborative effort                       
              designed to study growth mechanisms of CVD of diamond and                      
              related films.  Recent measurements have demonstrated that the                 
              morphology of CVD grown diamond films is very sensitive to                     
              activation and growth conditions.  In order to rationally                      
              control the growth process a link is necessary between the                     
              structure of the films produced and the chemistry that is                      
              taking place in the growth reactor.  To address this, three                    
              aspects of the CVD growth process are explored: identification                 
              of the gas phase species present in the boundary layer above                   
              the substrate, determination of the species present on the                     
              substrate surface and surface of the grown film, and                           
              structural determination of the film morphology.  Laser                        
              ionization and secondary ion mass spectrometries, surface                      
              vibrational spectroscopy, and electron and optical                             
              microscopies will be used for these determinations.  The                       
              results from these studies are expected to contribute to                       
              development of a fundamental understanding of how gas-phase                    
              and surface chemistry influence the composition, growth rate,                  
              and structural properties of the films produced.  This                         
              understanding is important for ultimate utilization of diamond                 
              film technology in the production of wear resistant coatings,                  
              high thermal conductivity semiconductors, abrasives, and                       
              optical coatings.
