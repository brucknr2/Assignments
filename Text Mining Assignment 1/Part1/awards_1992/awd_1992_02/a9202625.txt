              Whitney                                                                         
                                                                                            
              This award will provide supplementary support to enable                        
              Dr. Earl Whitney of the University of Utah to conduct collaborative            
              research with Dr. Ikuo Saito for 12 months at the National Institute           
              for Resources and Environment in Tsukuba, Japan.  Whitney and                  
              Saito will utilize Whitney's expertise in the chemistry and structure          
              of coal to develop models for the flow and production of coalbed               
              methane.                                                                       
                                                                                             
              Coalbed methane is a largely wasted fuel resource which recently               
              has become a significant contributor to the U.S. domestic natural              
              gas supply.  In order to develop accurate simulations and                      
              assessments of this resource, basic research is needed on the                  
              multicomponent desorption, diffusion, and flow effects which                   
              largely determine the composition and production of coalbed                    
              methane.  The experimental opportunities as well as pre-existing               
              data on coalbed and gas properties of methane at Dr. Saito's                   
              laboratory will complement Dr. Whitney's experience in modelling               
              the physical processes of coal.  Because of its policy to increase             
              energy efficiency and improve the utilization of wasted energy, the            
              Japanese government is encouraging the research of Dr. Saito so as             
              to develop a strong capability in fuel resources assessment.
