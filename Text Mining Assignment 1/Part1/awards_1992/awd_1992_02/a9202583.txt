Abstract    :
              This award is made by the Divisions of Chemistry, Materials                    
              Research and Electrical and Communications Systems  under the                  
              Materials Synthesis and Processing Initiative. The research                    
              will apply ring-opening metathesis polymerization to the                       
              synthesis of block copolymers having polyene or other                          
              electroactive microdomains. A goal will be the synthesis of                    
              quantum dots by morphology control of conjugated co-polymer                    
              blends. Stretch-orientation of quantum dots is expected to form                
              quantum lines with useful anisotropic optical properties. These                
              may find application as molecule-based optical gratings.                       
              Interfaces between inorganic semiconductors and doped                          
              conjugated polymers will also be evaluated as junctions and                    
              Schottky barrier devices.

              Ring opening metathesis routes to conjugated polymers will                     
              provide new materials with novel mechanical, physical, optical                 
              and electrical properties.
