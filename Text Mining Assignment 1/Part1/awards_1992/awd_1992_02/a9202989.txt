Abstract    :
              This U.S.-Mexico award will support Professor                                  
              Richard Ernst of the University of Utah in a                                   
              research collaboration with Professor M. Angeles                               
              Paz-Sandoval of the Centro de Investigacion y de                               
              Estudios Avanzados del I.P.N. (CINVESTAV) in Mexico                            
              City.  The purpose of the research is to study the                             
              incorporation of oxygen and nitrogen containing                                
              pentadienyl ligands into transition metal complexes.                           
                                                                                             
              This award will allow the expansion of a current                               
              domestic effort studying general pentadienyl ligands                           
              to the very promising oxygen and nitrogen containing                           
              analogues.  The Mexican side will focus primarily on                           
              the preparation of the new ligands, and                                        
              incorporation of these into metal complexes, while                             
              in Utah additional efforts will be made to                                     
              incorporate these ligands into other metal                                     
              complexes, to study potentially useful reaction                                
              chemistry, and to study the natures of these                                   
              compounds by a variety of physical methods,                                    
              including single crystal x-ray diffraction.  As                                
              metal pentadienyl compounds have already proven very                           
              useful in metal film depositions and reaction                                  
              chemistry, it is expected that similar practical                               
              applications will develop from the oxygen and                                  
              nitrogen containing analogues.
