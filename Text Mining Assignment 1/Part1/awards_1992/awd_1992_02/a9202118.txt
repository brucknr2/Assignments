Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The objective of this research is to assess the degree to which                
              deposit feeding populations in field circumstances are limited by              
              food, in the context of changes in nutritional quality of the                  
              sediment over spatial and temporal scales.  Past research has                  
              demonstrated that newly deposited seaweed based detritus                       
              contributes substantially to population growth of deposit feeders,             
              but that the particulate organic matter in the sediment also is of             
              great importance.  Seasonal studies over the last two years                    
              demonstrate that the sediment promotes declining population growth             
              from spring to fall and carbon retention also declines when a                  
              deposit feeder ingests spring versus fall sediment.  These findings            
              will be extended to experimental studies on the addition of                    
              detritus in the field, since a diagnostic marker of lateral                    
              transport of detritus is available.  The experimental addition                 
              studies will be combined with the marker approach as well as with              
              caged controls for predation, to examine the impact of detrital                
              addition and seasonal organic matter change in the sediment on the             
              population growth of the dominant oligochaete worm, Paranais                   
              litoralis, and on the behavior of the mud snails, Ilyanassa                    
              obsoleta and Hydrobia truncata.  Interactions between feeding                  
              behavior, sediment deposition and flow will also be examined.  This            
              study will be the first to utilize the combined spatial and                    
              temporal approach to examine detrital limitation of surface feeding            
              benthic field populations.
