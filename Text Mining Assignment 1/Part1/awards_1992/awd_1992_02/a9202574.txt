Abstract    :
              This research effort involves synthesis, processing and                        
              characterization of nickel-base nanophase alloys, including pure               
              Ni, Ni-base alloys, Ni with dispersed oxides, Ni/Al intermetallic              
              compounds, NiO, and Ni/NiO composites.  An ultrahigh vacuum                    
              synthesis system is used for production of metallic, intermetallic             
              and oxide dispersion-strengthened precursor powder particles under             
              controlled conditions.  A second system is used for the NiO and                
              Ni/NiO composites.  Compaction and densification are effected                  
              without exposing the specimens to ambient conditions.  The emphasis            
              is on synthesis and processing and characterization of                         
              microstructure.  Property measurements are used for guidance in the            
              control of processing variables.

              This research is aimed at new and improved metal-based materials               
              using unique processing techniques.  It is expected that such                  
              materials could see use in devices where high mechanical                       
              performance is essential.
