Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The equilibrium phases and thermodynamic stabilities in transition             
              metal silicide systems of importance in micro electronics will be              
              studied.  The titanium-silicon system will be investigated by high             
              temperature knudsen cell mass spectrometry, and the cobalt-silicon             
              and copper-silicon systems will be studied by means of high                    
              temperature solid state galvanic cells.  Enthalpies of reaction of             
              metals with amorphour silicon in multilayer composites and                     
              enthalpies of reaction of metals with crystalline silicon in                   
              bilayers will be studied by differential scanning calorimetry.                 
              Heat capacities in all three systems will be measured between 14K              
              and 1000K by differential scanning calorimetry in order to obtain              
              standard molar entropies and other thermal functions for the                   
              titanium, cobalt, and copper silicides.  The titanium and cobalt               
              silicides are materials of choice for interconnect applications in             
              micro electronics.  The results are expected to be of the                      
              importance in dealing with questions of stability and compatibility            
              in both the fabrication of devices and in their use.
