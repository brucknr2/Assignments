Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  The PI proposes to continue coordinated studies of low                    
              latitude and equatorial thermospheric wind and plasma drifts using             
              Fabry-Perot interferometer and incoherent scatter radar                        
              observations from Peru and Puerto Rico.  The main goal of this                 
              project is the detailed understanding of equatorial and low                    
              latitude ionosphere-thermosphere coupling.  The study of equatorial            
              plasma drift and neutral winds has been carried out in                         
              collaboration with M. A. Biondi and J. W. Meriwether.  The PI                  
              proposes to expand the low latitudes studies using extensive radar             
              and optical measurements from the Arecibo Observatory.  These                  
              studies will complement the PI's studies of the low latitude                   
              electrodynamics using incoherent scatter radar observations.  The              
              PI will continue to have the scientific support (at no cost) of M.             
              A. Biondi, and also of J. W. Meriwether.  The PI will also                     
              cooperate closely with the members of the MISETA project.  The main            
              topics of interest include the seasonal , solar and magnetic                   
              activity dependencies of the thermospheric winds, the relationship             
              between the neutral winds and the plasma drifts as a function of               
              latitude, the effects of the ionospheric disturbance dynamo, and               
              the validation of thermospheric circulation models.  The PI                    
              proposes to continue to analyze both the radar and optical data at             
              Utah State University and to make the measurements available to the            
              CAT (Coordinated Analysis of the Thermosphere) and for other                   
              coordinated CEDAR projects, and also to the NCAR database.
