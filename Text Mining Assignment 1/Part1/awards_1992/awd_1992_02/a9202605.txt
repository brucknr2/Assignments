Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Lake Forest College requests support from NSF for connection of                
              its campus network to NSFNET.  They will contract with                         
              netIllinois to provide a medium speed (56 thousand bits per                    
              second) connection to the NSFNET, a high speed (1.5 - 45 million               
              bits per second) National Backbone network.                                    
                                                                                             
              The College needs greater functionality and network speed to be                
              able to access supercomputers, libraries, and make file transfers              
              along with being able to implement a more reliable mail system.                
              Students and faculty research will benefit from the link.  This                
              is also a unique opportunity for the school to explore innovative              
              educational resources.***//
