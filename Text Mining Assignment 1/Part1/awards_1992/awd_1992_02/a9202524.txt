Abstract    :
              This award is made by the Divisions of Chemistry, Materials                    
              Research and Electrical and Communications Systems under the                   
              Materials Synthesis and Processing Initiative. The research                    
              will develop novel site-specific nuclear magnetic resonance                    
              (NMR) methods for the analysis of epitaxial structures and                     
              defects in III-V semiconductors and will correlate the                         
              information obtained with growth procedures and existing                       
              analysis techniques. By modifications of demonstrated methods                  
              of optical NMR, the sensitivity of NMR will be extended to                     
              allow the observation of small numbers of nuclear spins in very                
              small volumes. This represents an improvement of about ten                     
              orders of magnitude over ordinary NMR in the number of spins                   
              detectable, making possible surface and interface studies of                   
              important electronic and photonic materials. The spectral                      
              resolution for optically excited states will be improved about                 
              ten-thousand fold. Applications will be made to interface                      
              chemistry, strain fields, electronic structure, and the spatial                
              distribution of defects both in bulk crystals and                              
              quantum-confinement structures.

              The development of time-sequenced optical NMR will allow the                   
              detection of surface defects and sites in solid state materials                
              with extremely high sensitivity and resolution.
