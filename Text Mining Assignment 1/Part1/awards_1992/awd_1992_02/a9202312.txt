Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The proposed research is concerned with the study of ferroelectric             
              liquid crystals (FLC).  A program of research is proposed that                 
              includes FLC microscopic modeling, chemical synthesis, and material            
              evaluation.  The proposed studies are directed toward understanding            
              how molecules self organize in liquid crystal phases, and toward               
              developing new FLCs for electro-optic and nonlinear optic                      
              applications.  These studies are significant because there are                 
              opportunities to advance the basic physics and material design of              
              liquid crystals, and to develop new liquid crystal materials for               
              electro-optic and nonlinear optic applications.  This Materials                
              Synthesis and Processing proposal has been funded jointly by the               
              Division of Materials Research and the Chemistry Division.
