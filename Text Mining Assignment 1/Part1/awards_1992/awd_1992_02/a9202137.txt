Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Wartburg College requests support from NSF for connection of its               
              campus network to MIDnet.  MIDnet is the midlevel network which                
              supports the academic institutions located in the western half of              
              Iowa.  MIDnet will provide operations management and information               
              services and it will give Wartburg College connection to the                   
              NSFNET, a high speed (1.5 - 45 million bits per second) National               
              Backbone network.                                                              
                                                                                             
              The university needs greater functionality and network speed to                
              be able to access supercomputers, libraries, and make file                     
              transfers along with being able to implement a more reliable mail              
              system. Students and faculty research will benefit from the link.              
              This is also a unique opportunity for the school to explore                    
              innovative educational resources.***
