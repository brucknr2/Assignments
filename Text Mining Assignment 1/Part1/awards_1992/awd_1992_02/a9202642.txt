Abstract    :
              This research program investigates the issues                                  
              involved in the design and fabrication of a                                    
              monolithically integrated optoelectronic receiver                              
              with very high bandwidth and sensitivity.  The                                 
              receiver is based on the metal-semiconductor-metal                             
              (MSM) photodetector and heterojunction bipolar                                 
              transistor (HBT) in the AIInAs/Gain-As materials                               
              system grown on InP substrates.  The MSM                                       
              photodiode potentially has a very fast intrinsic                               
              response with low parasitic capacitance, and it is                             
              compatible for integration with lattice matched                                
              HBT's in a vertical layered geometry.  Optimization                            
              of the HBT epitaxial layer structure provides an                               
              effective means of widening the bandwidth, whereas                             
              reduction of the emitter area and improvement in                               
              emitter-base junction material quality will provide                            
              high current gain and low shot noise and                                       
              generation-recombination noise components.                                     
              This program considers improvements of molecular                               
              beam epitaxy growth procedures by using low                                    
              temperatures and migration enhanced epitaxy                                    
              techniques for the optimization of transistor and                              
              detector performance and reliability.  Integrated                              
              receiver bandwidth and sensitivity limitations are                             
              optimized in the presence of intrinsic                                         
              semiconductor device noise sources by materials                                
              improvements and receiver design.  It is believed                              
              that successful integration of a optoelectronic                                
              receiver based on the MBE materials synthesized                                
              under this program will push the speed limitation                              
              significantly beyond the highest reported 2 Gb/s,                              
              with the best possible bit error rate limitation                               
              permitted by the semiconductor material properties.
