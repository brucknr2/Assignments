Abstract    :
              It is proposed to continue the observations of ionospheric plasma              
              turbulence by radar back-scatter.  Observations in 1990 and 1991               
              greatly increased the understanding of ionospheric Langmuir                    
              turbulence generated by a radio wave reflected in the F-region.                
              In the proposed observations spectra of Langmuir turbulence will               
              be obtained at 150 m height intervals every ms.  Preliminary                   
              results of this type obtained in August 1991 show the temporal                 
              development and decay of the spectrum of Langmuir turbulence for               
              10 heights 150 m apart, for pulsed HF transmissions of 10 ms                   
              duration at 1 ms time intervals.  It is also proposed to conduct               
              theoretical investigations using an analytical model of Langmuir               
              turbulence.  In that model the free Langmuir mode is considered                
              as the untrapped part of long wavelength plasma turbulence                     
              excited by the modulational instability.  A generalization of the              
              existing analytical model for the case of a finite magnetic field              
              appropriate for the ionospheric experiments is also proposed.
