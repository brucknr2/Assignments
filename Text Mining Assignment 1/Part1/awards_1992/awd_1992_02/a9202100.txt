Abstract    :
              This is the first year of a three year continuing effort.                      
              This research is to study the feasibility of human-computer                    
              interaction through the use of on-line recognition of                          
              electroencephalogram (EEG) patterns.  A system that can identify,              
              on-line, which of several mental tasks a person is performing                  
              could provide an alphabet with which a severely disabled person                
              can compose commands to devices like a wheel chair.  Most prior                
              research has focused on recognition accuracy rather than on fast,              
              real-time responses.  The goals of this research are to                        
              characterize the limitations of current EEG recognition methods,               
              to increase the accuracy and decrease the computation time of EEG              
              recognition by use of a neural network approach, and to develop a              
              practical real-time method.  The performance of conventional                   
              methods and of neural network learning methods designed for high-              
              dimensional data will be compared.  Evaluations of feature and                 
              classifier characteristics will be based on classification                     
              accuracy, robustness and computation speed.  This project has                  
              relevance to the field of pattern recognition in general, and to               
              the neural network and human-computer interaction fields in                    
              particular.
