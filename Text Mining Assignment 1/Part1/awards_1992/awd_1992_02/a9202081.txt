Abstract    :
              Kaveh         This research builds on experience that has been gained  during
              the construction and calibration of a laboratory  ultrasound-in-air array, in
              order to establish a systematic  approach for experimentation and theoretical
              analysis. Optimizing  functionals are being developed for a general class of
              estimators  with similar computational burden as the well-known method of 
              MUSIC.  These estimators are expected to significantly reduce the  threshold
              signal to noise ratio, for a general calibrated array,  over a method such as
              MUSIC.  Analysis techniques are being  established within a probabilistic
              framework for comparing the  resolution thresholds of estimators in this class.
              Detection  methods are also being developed in conjunction with experimental 
              measurements that make optimum use of the array calibration data.  The new
              algorithms are being generalized to cases involving  wideband signals and
              signals possessing special characteristics  such as cyclostationarity. The
              ongoing experimental work, which  includes the implementation of subspace
              estimation algorithms on  DSP processors, is intended to establish the level of
               practicality of many proposed methods.
