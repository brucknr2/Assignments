Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The proposed symposium will be held at the annual meeting of the               
              American Society of Zoologists, a broad based society which                    
              includes many developmental and evolutionary biologists. The                   
              proposed speakers are a group of developmental biologists who are              
              interested in development as an evolutionary process. The program              
              includes embryologists who study the embryos of closely related                
              species with different larval forms, as well as geneticists and                
              molecular biologists who compare genes governing the formation of              
              the body plan during embryogenesis in different species. There is              
              now evidence that embryonic changes can profoundly influence the               
              life history of a species, especially in producing different                   
              larval forms. As more becomes known about the genes governing                  
              embryonic development, it may be possible to identify                          
              evolutionary constraints present in the elaboration of an embryo.              
              One problem in this field has been lack of communication between               
              evolutionary and developmental biologists. This symposium is                   
              designed to generate discussion between scientists in different                
              disciplines, by exposing this group of developmental biologists                
              to a wide ranging audience. The interaction should generate                    
              renewed interest in how embryos develop, and in how developmental              
              changes may influence the evolutionary process.
