Abstract    :
              The proposed research will address the various mechanisms by which             
              grout components could be released from the stabilized soil mass,              
              and measure the resultant concentration of these components in the             
              leachate. These concentrations will be determined by total organic             
              carbon analysis and inductively-coupled plasma emission                        
              spectrophotometry, respectively. The toxicity characteristic                   
              leaching procedure will also be performed on the most promising of             
              the formulations identified for each of the grouts investigated.               
              Leachate characterization tests from soaking and permeation tests              
              on samples excavated from the prototype grout bulbs and acute                  
              toxicity tests will also be conducted.
