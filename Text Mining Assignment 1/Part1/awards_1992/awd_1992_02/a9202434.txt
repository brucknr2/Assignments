Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Polypeptides will be synthesized as "fuzzy rods" and "star rods".              
              Fuzzy rods have a stiff backbone but many flexible sidechains.                 
              They are the largest, most rigid materials known to form liquid                
              crystals in solution and upon heating.  This plus a narrow size                
              distribution makes them ideally suited to establish the flow                   
              characteristics of molten rods, which is one objective.  The                   
              versatile sidechain chemistry can also lead to completely new                  
              materials.  For example, crosslinking of the liquid crystals will              
              yield covalent fuzzy rod networks, leading to oriented polymeric               
              aerogels.  Star rods made by attaching several fuzzy rods to a                 
              central core exhibit unusual structures in both solution and melt.             
              They are not really rigid, but the arms are nearly so.  More                   
              uniform arm distribution is a major objective of the research.                 
              Star rods will elucidate important features of polymer solutions,              
              such as the approach to semidilute conditions in rods.  They will              
              also contribute to the understanding of molten rods.  This almost              
              completely ignored macromolecular architecture may also facilitate             
              production of molecular level composites, nonlinear optical                    
              materials, biaxially oriented films, and perhaps micromotors,                  
              materials with automatic temperature compensation, or optical                  
              switches.
