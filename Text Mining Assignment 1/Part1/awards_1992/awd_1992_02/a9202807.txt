Abstract    :
              The goal of this project is to investigate the design of                       
              parallel algorithms for geometric problems, both for shared-                   
              memory (PRAM) models and the (more realistic) network models.                  
              The network models of interest include the situation where the                 
              number of processors available p is fixed (i.e., does not                      
              depend on the size n of the problem being solved).  In such a                  
              framework, one needs to bring into the picture the sequential                  
              "front end" to the parallel machine, since the parallel                        
              machine is too small to even store the problem being solved.                   
              Thus the techniques used are both parallel and sequential,                     
              since a substantial part of the computation may take place in                  
              the sequential machine.  Attention will be given to  problems                  
              that are still open within the traditional frameworks (i.e.,                   
              assuming massive rather than limited parallelism), with                        
              special emphasis on problems whose solution would impact the                   
              parallel complexity of many geometric problems (for example,                   
              multisearching and matrix searching).  The project will also                   
              initiate investigation of parallelism for computational                        
              algebraic geometry and geometric modeling.  The research                       
              undertaken involves implementations on commercially available                  
              parallel hardware.
