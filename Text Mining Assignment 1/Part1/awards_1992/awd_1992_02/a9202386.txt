Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This proposal describes studies on cellular components that are                
              involved in harvesting the energy of sunlight and making that                  
              energy useful for the production of sugars and carbohydrates in                
              the cell.  The organism being investigated is in the group of                  
              algae known as diatoms and is named Phaeodactylum tricornutum.                 
              Diatoms are very abundant in both marine and fresh water                       
              environments.  In fact, these organisms may be responsible for as              
              much as 20% of the total CO2  fixation on the earth.  We have                  
              been studying both the structure of the light harvesting                       
              polypeptides of Phaeodactylum and the way in which they are                    
              targeted from the cytoplasm of the cell to their final location                
              in the cell plastid, an extremely important organelle specialized              
              to perform photosynthesis.  By understanding how proteins can be               
              specifically placed into different subcellular compartments like               
              the plastid, we may be able to control both the constituents and               
              the levels of specific constituents that are located in those                  
              compartments.  This may prove very important in increasing the                 
              photosynthetic capabilities of organisms and ultimately in                     
              culturing these organisms in 'ocean field' (aquaculture) for the               
              production of feed for livestock.
