Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This composite project involves the collaboration of three                     
              departments in two separate universities.  Novel conducting                    
              polymers that will be suitable for the optoelectronics industry                
              will be studied, and will include the synthesis of new                         
              organosilicon polymers based on the incorporation of heteroelements            
              into the carbon backbone structure of the polymers and their                   
              characterization by a variety of different techniques.  Processing             
              methods that will yield homogeneous thin films, coatings, and                  
              fibers of these polymers, that will be suitable for optical devices            
              such as optical modulators and switches or electroluminescing (EL)             
              devices will also be explored.  Some of these new polymers will                
              attract considerable scientific interest in the physics and                    
              chemistry communities by providing stable processible degenerate               
              ground state polymers supporting charged solitons or EL systems,               
              for which nongeminate decay processes will be studied in detail.               
              This project is being supported jointly by the Division of                     
              Materials Research, and the Division of Electrical and                         
              Communications Systems.
