Abstract    :
              The Fellow will examine the relationships between extreme                      
              hydrologic events on continents and large-scale atmospheric and                
              oceanic conditions in both modern and paleoclimatic records.                   
              Studies will determine any relationships of El Nino/Southern                   
              Hemisphere events (or the Asian Monsoon) on global weather and                 
              climate.  The Fellow will spend her fellowship tenure at the                   
              Pennsylvania State University.
