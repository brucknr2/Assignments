Abstract    :
                   This project will develop models and analysis algorithms for              
              access control systems.  Architectures for implementing these systems          
              will also be investigated.  Access control systems mediate (i)                 
              operations on data objects (e.g., user A reads file F), as well as             
              (ii) control operations which alter access permissions (e.g., user A           
              authorizes user B to read file F).  In current systems all, but the            
              most rudimentary, control operations are typically centralized in a            
              single authority (viz., the system administrator).  This project will          
              investigate systems where such authorization is decentralized and              
              itself subject to change.  Harrison, Ruzzo and Ullman (HRU) proposed a         
              general model for this purpose.  Unfortunately, their model has                
              extremely weak safety properties (i.e., it is undecidable or                   
              computationally infeasible to determine whether a given user can ever          
              acquire a particular privilege).  Subsequently a number of models with         
              varying expressiveness and analyzability were published.  Recent               
              results by Ammann and Sandhu for their Extended Schematic Protection           
              Model strongly indicate that the pessimistic results of HRU can be             
              circumvented.  This project will build on previous work by the                 
              principal investigators.  It will develop and analyze new access               
              control models with the objective of analyzing their safety                    
              properties, expressive power, fundamental constructs and                       
              implementation issues.
