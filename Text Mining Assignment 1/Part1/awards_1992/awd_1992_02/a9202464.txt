Abstract    :
              Description:  This project partially supports the                              
              American Institute of Indian Studies (AIIS) for                                
              management and funding of research activities in                               
              the behavioral and natural sciences conducted by                               
              U.S. scientists in India.  Candidates with background                          
              in India who apply to AIIS are screened, and those                             
              nominated are referred to NSF for final selection.                             
              The AIIS manages the required clearances for the                               
              research, and the logistics involved in the travel,                            
              local arrangement and conduct of research in India.                            
              They therefore meet NSF and Government of India                                
              requirements as well as the scientists' needs.                                 
              Areas of research typically include anthropology,                              
              linguistics, sociology, economics, political sciences                          
              as well as biology, mathematics and engineering.                               
              The U.S.-India program supports U.S. scientific                                
              research in India in areas of interest to NSF and                              
              where the research could lead to better understanding                          
              between the two countries through science.  This project                       
              meets program criteria.                                                        
                                                                                             
              Scope:  The AIIS is a very well organized institute                            
              with membership of over 42 of the major U.S.                                   
              universities and colleges with South Asian or Indian                           
              Studies programs.  The AIIS reviews their applicants                           
              through selection panels made of eminent scientists                            
              in various broad scientific disciplines.  The AIIS                             
              offices in New Delhi and other major cities in India                           
              have well-established contacts with Government of India                        
              departments and are capable of facilitating U.S.                               
              researchers' collaboration with host institutes.                               
              The areas of research considered are broad, and                                
              funds from this project are used only for those                                
              normally supportable by NSF science divisions.  The                            
              candidates and awardees are carefully screened both                            
              by the AIIS and by NSF.  This program clearly                                  
              strengthens the scientific collaboration and                                   
              understanding between India and the U.S.
