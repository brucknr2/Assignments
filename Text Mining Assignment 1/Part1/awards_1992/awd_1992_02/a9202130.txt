Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Research will be conducted on the complex flow of viscoelastic                 
              fluids. The approach is through complementary use of                           
              experimental and numerical simulation techniques. The                          
              experimental part is based on rheological characterization,                    
              and also a combination of Laser-Doppler-Anemometer and fluid                   
              birefringence measurements. Numerical simulations are via                      
              finite element modeling using both differential and integral                   
              constitutive descriptions of the fluid.                                        
              Polymeric material processing involves flow characteristics of                 
              complex fluids, and greatly improved modeling and predictive                   
              capabilities are required for reliable and realistic process                   
              design.
