Abstract    :
                   The very general problem of solving non-linear systems of                 
              equations efficiently has many important applications, in virtually            
              every area of science and engineering.  Steven Smale and his                   
              students and collaborators will use methods of geometry, especially            
              Newton's method and path following, to study their relevance to                
              these problems, with the aim of eventually leading to substantial              
              reduction in costs of computation.
