Abstract    :
              This award provides support for an international                               
              collaborative effort to develop and evaluate a new type of                     
              ion source for mass spectrometric analysis of biopolymers                      
              and bioconjugates.  The American collaborator is a skilled                     
              mass spectroscopist active in use of mass spectrometry for                     
              sequence analysis of proteins and other polymers of                            
              biological significance.  The Russian collaborators have                       
              made significant contributions in development of mass                          
              spectrometry instrumentation.                                                  
                                                                                             
              The use of mass spectrometry for detailed analysis of                          
              biopolymers is becoming one of the most important techniques                   
              for modern analytical biochemistry.  As such, it plays an                      
              important role in all aspects of biotechnology, from                           
              research to process development and quality control.  Thus                     
              technological advances in this area, such as those likely to                   
              result from this award, have great potential for                               
              strengthening both basic and applied aspects of biological                     
              research.
