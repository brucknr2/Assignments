Abstract    :
              The goal of this research is to                                                
              identify and synthesize a polymer                                              
              system to serve as a scaffold for                                              
              functioning mammalian cells.  The                                              
              optimal polymer system would                                                   
              maximize cellular function in vivo.                                            
              The basic requirements for the                                                 
              scaffold include biodegradability,                                             
              biocompatibility, suitable                                                     
              mechanical properties, and an                                                  
              adhesive moiety to facilitate cell                                             
              attachment.  In order to reach this                                            
              goal, several steps need to be                                                 
              completed.  The exact ordering of                                              
              the polymer processing and adhesion                                            
              moiety attachment steps will be                                                
              determined during the project.                                                 
              Cell culture studies will be                                                   
              conducted on these polymers in                                                 
              vitro, and surgical implantation of                                            
              these systems with an assessment of                                            
              structure and function in vivo will                                            
              be attempted.
