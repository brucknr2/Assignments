Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The Coleoptera, or beetles, constitute the most diverse order of               
              living organisms.  They make up some 40% of all animal species,                
              and occupy virtually every trophic position.  They are important               
              as pests, biological control agents, pollinators, and vectors of               
              disease.  They contribute to soil building and the recycling of                
              plant and animal materials.  Yet, it is impossible to find general             
              works that allow the identification of the species of beetles                  
              occurring in any area of the New World tropics.                                
                                                                                             
              Under this project, material will be collected and processed                   
              towards the eventual goal of a guide to the estimated 1,200                    
              species of beetles in the Virgin Islands.  In addition to new                  
              collections, a database will be built of all known material, and               
              publications describing new species will be published.
