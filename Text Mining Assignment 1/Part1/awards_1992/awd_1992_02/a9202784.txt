Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This integrated study of the nature of deformation at the toe of               
              the Nankai prism will include an numerical calculation of particle             
              displacement and deformation, a measurement of ductile fabrics in              
              clay-rich sediments at ODP site 808 and Nankai Trough area and                 
              experimental deformation of the Nankai clay-rich sediments.  The               
              work will be carried out by a graduate student under the PI's                  
              supervision and will provide first-order estimates of the amount               
              and distribution of diffuse deformation in Nankai prism and may                
              enable the proof and refinement of the proposed analysis                       
              techniques.
