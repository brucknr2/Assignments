Abstract    :
              This proposal represents an                                                    
              investigation into the feasibility                                             
              of developing a smart structural                                               
              composite which has a self-healing                                             
              capability whenever and wherever                                               
              cracks are generated as a result of                                            
              seismic overloads, cyclic loading                                              
              or other mechanical or
