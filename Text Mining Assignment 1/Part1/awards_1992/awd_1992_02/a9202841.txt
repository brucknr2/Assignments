              This award partially funds installation of a microwave system to               
              implement a 10 megabit transmission link to the Unversity of                   
              Colorado at Colorado Springs (UC-CS), the site of its gateway to               
              NSFNET.  This will replace an existing 9.6 kbs modem link to                   
              UC-CS.***
