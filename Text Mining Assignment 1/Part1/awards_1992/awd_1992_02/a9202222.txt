Abstract    :
              Recent advances in the synthesis of artificially                               
              structured solids will be applied to the                                       
              fabrication of one-dimensional structures,                                     
              granular solids, and nanocomposite materials,                                  
              all of which have been found to exhibit new                                    
              and excitingly physical properties.  Unique and                                
              enhanced properties are expected to result                                     
              from the extremely small size and structures,                                  
              the prominent roles of surfaces and interfaces,                                
              the extra degrees of freedom, and the                                          
              nanocomposite nature of the solids.  The                                       
              unique perpendicular magnetic and conducting                                   
              properties of the one-dimensional structures,                                  
              and the magnetic, mechanical, and other                                        
              nanostructure-induced properties of materials                                  
              consisting of ultrafine particles are                                          
              emphasized.  The methods of synthesis and                                      
              processing in this work include nuclear particle                               
              track technology in conjunction with                                           
              electrodeposition for the one-dimensional                                      
              structures, high-rate sputtering of granular                                   
              metal films, and electrodeposition of                                          
              particulate composites.  Some of these                                         
              materials have already demonstrated promising                                  
              properties for applications such as                                            
              interconnects in a electronic packaging,                                       
              perpendicular magnetic and magneto-optical                                     
              storage media, and environment resistant                                       
              surfaces and coatings.
