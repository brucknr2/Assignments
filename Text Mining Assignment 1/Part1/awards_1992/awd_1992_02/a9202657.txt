Abstract    :
                   In Dabob Bay (Washington), a temperate fjord, the annual                  
              cycles of phytoplankton standing stock and production rate exhibit             
              spectacular increases (phytoplankton blooms) in spring and autumn,             
              indicating lack of control by grazer populations.  Yet virtually               
              all organic matter produced by the phytoplankton during blooms is              
              ultimately consumed by grazers.  Moreover, a major fraction of the             
              grazing (about 67% on an annual basis) appears to be due to                    
              macrozooplankton suspension-feeders, with microzooplankton being               
              secondary grazers.  A conceptual model of grazing in Dabob Bay was             
              developed, hypothesizing the identities of the macro- and                      
              microzooplankton grazers and postulating mechanisms for the                    
              approximate annual balance between phytoplankton growth and                    
              grazing.  A field test of the conceptual model was developed and               
              carried out on three extended research cruises to Dabob Bay in                 
              1990-91.  This project will complete the analysis of samples and               
              data, and produce a synthesis. By direct measuerements this study              
              will provide quanitative assessment of mechanisms and rates of                 
              processes governing the dynamics of phytoplankton production and               
              its fate in a highly productive coastal pelagic ecosystem.
