Abstract    :
              This U.S.-Mexico award will support Professor                                  
              Mark Spong of the University of                                                
              Illinois-Champaign in a research collaboration                                 
              with Professors Jaime Alvarez and Rafael Castro                                
              of the Centro de Investigacion y de Estudios                                   
              Avanzados del I.P.N. (CINVESTAV) in Mexico                                     
              City.  The proposed research will combine                                      
              techniques of nonlinear and adaptive                                           
              control theory, including the control of                                       
              nonlinear systems with time delay, with                                        
              detailed studies of the dynamics of robots and                                 
              teleoperators for the control of high                                          
              performance manipulators.                                                      
                                                                                             
              The primary benefit of this collaboration will                                 
              arise from the combination of the expertise in                                 
              robot dynamics and the experimental facilities                                 
              at Illinois with the expertise in nonlinear                                    
              control theory, adaptive control theory, and                                   
              the theory of nonlinear time delay systems at                                  
              CINVESTAV.  The present research could have                                    
              important applications to work in hazardous                                    
              environments, such as repair and maintenance in                                
              nuclear plants, off-shore oil riggs, and                                       
              undersea mining and exploration.
