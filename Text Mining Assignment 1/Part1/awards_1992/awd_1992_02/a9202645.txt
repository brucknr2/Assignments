Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              It has been discovered recently that porous silicon structures                 
              exhibit strong visible photoluminescence at room temperature.  This            
              program focuses on the structure-property relationships of porous              
              silicon.  Porous silicon structures are formed by a chemical                   
              etching process; however, very little is known about how the                   
              etching parameters control the morphology of the porous structures             
              and the resultant light emitting characteristics.  Computer                    
              simulations of the etching process will be used to develop an                  
              understanding of the range of porous structures attainable as a                
              function of processing parameters.  A similar range of porous                  
              structures will be examined experimentally.  The ultimate aim of               
              the program is the development of structural phase diagrams                    
              relating microstructure to processing parameters and light emitting            
              properties.                                                                    
              %%%                                                                            
              Light emitting porous silicon would be an inexpensive alternative              
              to other optical materials and allow for integration with silicon-             
              based electronics.  This program addresses materials processing                
              aspects relevant to the fabrication of porous silicon structures,              
              and strives to characterize and understand the relationships                   
              between structure and optical properties.  The program includes the            
              synthesis of porous silicon structures, experimental analysis of               
              structure/property relationships and theoretical modeling of the               
              growth processes.
