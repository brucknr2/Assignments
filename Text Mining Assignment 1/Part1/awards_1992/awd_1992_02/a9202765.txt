Abstract    :
              With support from the Organic Dynamics Program Professor                       
              William M. Jones of the Univerisity of Florida will continue                   
              his work to examine the rearrangements of alkyl groups from                    
              metals to carbene centers.  The rearrangment will be attempted                 
              with first and second row late transitions metals by using                     
              ligand strain energy to drive the reverse of the migratory                     
              insertion reaction of the carbene. The synthesis of stable                     
              carbynes will be attempted using the same strategy.  In                        
              addition the transition metal complexes of strained allenes,                   
              their valence isomers, and tropynes will be synthesized and                    
              studied.                                                                       
              %%%                                                                            
              The fundamentally important migrations of molecular fragments                  
              from metals to carbon will be studied.  These migrations are                   
              the key steps in numerous important processes including the                    
              Fischer-Tropsch reaction which converts carbon monooxide and                   
              hydrogen into hydrocarbons which could potentially be used as                  
              fuel.  The practical limits of this reaction will be explored                  
              by examining the migrations of various groups to form novel and                
              isolable organometallic compounds.
