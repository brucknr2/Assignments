Abstract    :
                   This project on inverse problems will develop mathematical                
              recovery methods for unknown coefficients from second order                    
              partial differential equations in multi-dimensions.  The                       
              stability of these methods and their computational costs will                  
              also be analyzed.  Applications to age-structured populations                  
              will be investigated and information such as birth and death                   
              rates will be extracted from certain functionals of the                        
              population.                                                                    
                   Inverse problems arise in mathematical models describing                  
              physical  systems containing uncertainties in coefficients or                  
              boundary  conditions.  Using additional information, in the form               
              of boundary data or interior measurements, a more accurate model               
              is sought -- one in which the output of the model conforms to the              
              measured data as closely as possible.  Important examples of                   
              inverse problems are medical imaging using CAT scans, acoustic                 
              sonograms, and non-destructive testing of aircraft wings in                    
              searching for damaged or failed sections.
