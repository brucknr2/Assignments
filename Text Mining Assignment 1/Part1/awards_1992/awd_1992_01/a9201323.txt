Abstract    :
              This project will organize, convene and report                                 
              on an NSF regionally-based workshop on                                         
              architectural research needs in earthquake                                     
              hazard mitigation.  The workshop will review                                   
              and analyze the current state-of-the-art in                                    
              relation to a range of earthquake hazard                                       
              mitigation in architectural and nonstructural                                  
              systems, and in relation to broader land-use                                   
              planning issues and physical urban design                                      
              issues.  Future research needs will be identified                              
              and prioritized for these same systems under                                   
              the goals of the Architectural and Mechanical                                  
              Systems (AMS) program element.  As one of                                      
              three regional workshops on the topic subject,                                 
              this workshop will focus on East-Coast issues.                                 
                                                                                             
              A Final Report on Workshop results will be                                     
              issued for distribution to the architectural and                               
              urban design research community and for NSF                                    
              use in program development.
