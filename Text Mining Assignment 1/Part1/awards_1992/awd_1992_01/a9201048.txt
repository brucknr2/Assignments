Abstract    :
                   This grant will support the urgent collection of Silurian                 
              fossil invertebrates from threatened exposures near Waukesha,                  
              Wisconsin.  The site (Brandon Bridge Quarry), ca. 420 million years            
              old and reported in Science in 1985, is extremely rare in                      
              preserving soft-bodied invertebrates.  The locality will be                    
              destroyed by commercial mining activity within one or two years.               
              The project also involves site stratigraphy, sedimentology and                 
              taphonomy, and initial preparation the Silurian biota.  Recovery               
              and study of these fossils will lead to a much better understanding            
              of the diversity and paleoecology of marine life during the                    
              Silurian and the phylogeny of marine invertebrates.
