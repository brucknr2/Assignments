Abstract    :
              This research project, in the Analytical and Surface Chemistry                 
              Program, will develop the technique of Near Field Scanning                     
              Optical Microscopy for the characterization of the surface                     
              structure and chemistry of "soft" material surfaces.  In                       
              addition to work on problems of instrument development,                        
              calibration of the scanning optical microscopy methodology will                
              be carried out.  Application of the method to a number of                      
              problems involving biological interfaces, membranes, and                       
              organic monolayers will be pursued.  The development of a                      
              microscopic technique which can provide very high resolution                   
              structural information on these difficult surfaces, in                         
              combination with spatially resolved spectroscopic and chemical                 
              information, will have a very wide impact in the field of                      
              surface analysis and characterization.

              The ability to characterize the structure of the surfaces of                   
              biological and macromolecular samples is crucial to the                        
              understanding of membrane processes and polymer properties.                    
              The research being carried out in this project will develop a                  
              promising new technique for the structural characterization of                 
              these "soft" material surfaces.  This scanning optical                         
              microscopy method will have a great impact on the understanding                
              of this important class of materials.
