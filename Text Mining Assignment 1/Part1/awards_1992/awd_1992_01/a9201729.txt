Abstract    :
                   Putinar will investigate two sets of problems.  The first                 
              concerns Toeplitz operators on multivariable Bergman spaces and                
              their relevance for the function theory of several complex                     
              variables.  He will relate the spectral problems for this class                
              of operators to the theory of functions in pseudoconvex domains                
              with L2-growth control at the boundary.  The second set of                     
              problems is related to the theory of moments in Euclidean n-                   
              space.  Putinar will try to determine methods for solving certain              
              moment problems on semialgebraic subsets by using specific                     
              operator theories.                                                             
                   Operator theory is that part of mathematics that studies the              
              infinite dimensional generalizations of matrices.  In particular,              
              when restricted to finite dimensional subspaces, an operator has               
              the usual linear properties, and thus can be represented by a                  
              matrix.  The central problem in operator theory is to classify                 
              operators satisfying additional conditions given in terms of                   
              associated operators (e.g. the adjoint) or in terms of the                     
              underlying space.  Operator theory underlies much of mathematics,              
              and many of the applications of mathematics to other sciences.
