Abstract    :
                   This research addresses theoretical and algorithmic aspects               
              of integer and combinatorial programming.  Among the theoretical               
              questions are: when is a combinatorial optimization problem whose              
              constraint matrix has coefficients of 0, 1, or -1 solvable as a                
              linear program (balanced 0, +1, -1 matrices); how can one restate              
              a given problem in a higher dimensional space so that projecting               
              it back on the original space results in a better formulation                  
              (lifting/projecting techniques); for a given Lagrangean                        
              formulation, how can one find a valid inequality whose inclusion               
              into the Lagrangean is guaranteed to improve the bound provided by             
              the latter (the face separation problem).                                      
                   Among the algorithmic objectives of the project are: an                   
              efficient branch and cut algorithm for mixed 0-1 programs based on             
              lift and project cuts; improved bounding procedures for the                    
              traveling salesman problem and some of its relatives, based on the             
              use of newly identified facets, and expected to produce improved               
              algorithms for difficult industrial scheduling problems and several            
              types of job shop scheduling problems.
