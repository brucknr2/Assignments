Abstract    :
                   This effort is to explore the improvements in hole quality and            
              drill life of micro-drills used in the printed circuit board                   
              manufacturing industry, by the utilization of helical points on the            
              drills rather than planar points that are currently utilized.                  
              A new geometrical model that describes a helical point on a micro              
              -drill will be developed.  Based on this model a kinematic                     
              mechanism will be designed and fabricated to grind helical points              
              on micro-drills.  The availability of helically-pointed                        
              micro-drills is essential to explore improvements in performance               
              and life that appear to be                                                     
              theoretically feasible.  This feasibility is based on the fact that            
              helical points offer a much higher clearance angle distribution                
              along the drill's cutting edge, without weakening the edge, in                 
              comparison to planar pointed drills.                                           
                   This effort that deals only with micro-drills in combination              
              with the large dollar volume of the printed circuit board industry             
              and it's strategic importance to the electronic industry, makes                
              this a high risk venture with a significant potential for large                
              pay-offs.
