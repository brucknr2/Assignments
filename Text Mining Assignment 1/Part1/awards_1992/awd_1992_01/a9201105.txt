Abstract    :
              9201105  Plemmons  Two undergraduate students will be involved in this project. 
              One  of them will work on developing iterative methods for linear  estimation
              in signal processing.  The work includes developing  effective FFT-based
              preconditioners for conjugate gradient  iterative algorithms.  The other
              student will study matrix  eigenvalue methods in the adaptive control of
              deformable mirrors.  Matrix computations play an important role in aero-optics 
              applications for astronomical and aero-optic imaging.  Numerical 
              experimentation will be undertaken, using data from an  astronomical facility.
