Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                                                                                            
              The highly productive Peru upwelling system is regularly perturbed             
              by periodic El Nino-Southern Oscillation events that result in                 
              warmer-than-average sea surface temperatures and a sharp reduction             
              in the reduction in the region's productivity.  An historical                  
              record of El Nino in Peru Margin sediments has been derived from               
              the distribution of alkenones and Uk37 as proxy for paleo-sea                  
              surface temperature.  This research will enhance and expand on                 
              these results with a more detailed study of Peru sediments                     
              extending over 500 ybp.  The initial focus of the study will be to             
              deconvolute diagenetic and input driven changes in the sedimentary             
              record of chlorins and carotenoids.  By measuring the distribution             
              of both pigments (carotenoids, chlorins) and their degradation                 
              products (loliolides, pyrroles), transient changes in depositional             
              conditions will be able to be identified.  This information will be            
              combined with data from the total pigment in sediment expressed as             
              the molar sum:  (pigment + degradation product), to measure changes            
              in original input.  Changes in hydrography preserved in the                    
              alkenone record with expected changes in the nature and intensity              
              of primary production preserved in the record of algal pigments in             
              sediments will then be compared.
