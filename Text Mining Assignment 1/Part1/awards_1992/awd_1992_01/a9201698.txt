Abstract    :
              We believe that the physical properties of artificially-prepared               
              thin films are strongly affected by the synthesis and processing               
              methods employed and therefore structural and chemical                         
              characterization must play a key role in all research performed on             
              such films.  We plan to synthesize novel magnetic thin films using             
              state-of-the-art techniques such as sputtering and molecular-beam              
              epitaxy, then characterize the structure and chemical composition              
              using a wide variety of methods.  Growth and characterization                  
              studies will be correlated with physical properties, especially                
              magnetotransport and magnetization.  The studies will relate to the            
              magnetism of superlattices and interfaces with two problems - giant            
              magneto-resistance and exchange bias - receiving particular                    
              attention.
