Abstract    :
              The design and geometric processing of free form curves and                    
              surfaces can be greatly facilitated by gaining an                              
              understanding of their visual appearance.  For example, the                    
              concepts of convex and spiral shapes link the visual                           
              appearance of a curve to its synthesis and processing and thus                 
              can be used to develop effective techniques to improve the use                 
              of curves in a computer environment.  The project develops                     
              further definitions to categorize free form surfaces based on                  
              shape properties and develops these into useful techniques for                 
              the design and processing of surfaces.  These techniques will                  
              have a common mathematical basis and this will help to merge                   
              the design and engineering of parts.
