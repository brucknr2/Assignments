Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  The PIs wish to install and operate a partial reflection                  
              drifts and a meteor radar over a three-year period at Sondre                   
              Stomfjord, Greenland.  Goals include studying high-latitude                    
              dynamics in the height range from approximately 60 to 110 km.  The             
              cooperative research effort with Clemson University and the                    
              University of Colorado will include the study of seasonal                      
              variations in tidal amplitudes and phases, gravity wave                        
              characteristics, climatology, and fluxes, and the scattering                   
              mechanisms producing the partial reflections.
