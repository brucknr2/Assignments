              Cambridge                                                                      
                                                                                             
              This award is under the Long and Medium-Term Research at                       
              Foreign Centers of Excellence Program, which enables U.S.                      
              scientists and engineers to conduct three to twelve months of                  
              research abroad at research centers of proven excellence.  The                 
              program's awards provide opportunities for joint research, and the             
              use of unique or complementary facilities, expertise and                       
              experimental conditions abroad.                                                
                                                                                             
              This award will support a three-month postdoctoral research visit              
              by Dr. Paul Green to work with Dr. Martin Rees at the University               
              of Cambridge.                                                                  
                                                                                             
              Dr. Green plans to study the dependence of UV emission-line                    
              parameters on soft X-ray luminosity in quasars, using samples of               
              quasars with no emission-line bias.  He will measure IUE                       
              equivalent widths and Einstein X-ray fluxes to determine the                   
              relative importance of the UV and X-ray ionizing continua to                   
              emission from the broad line region of quasars.  He will analyze               
              the potential of an X-ray "Baldwin effect" for use as a standard               
              candle in cosmological tests.                                                  
                                                                                             
              The award recommendation provides funds to cover international                 
              travel and a stipend for three months.
