Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  People who occupy positions of power are held in higher esteem            
              that they otherwise would be.  This elevation in status can be                 
              reduced if the social advantages responsible for a given                       
              individual's power are known.  This doctoral dissertation project              
              is an experimental study that will integrate theoretical concepts              
              from three theories in sociology--exchange, expectation states, and            
              status value--in an effort to explain why power confers status and             
              why it confers more status in some situations than in others.  One             
              hundred and fifty participants will take part in an experiment                 
              designed to examine the effect of differences in power which                   
              produce a difference in rewards in the presence or, alternatively,             
              in the absence of information about the social structural power                
              that produces that difference in rewards.                                      
                                                                                             
                   This project will contribute to the fields of sociology and               
              social psychology by increasing our understanding of the connection            
              of power to status.  In addition, it will increase our                         
              understanding of the motive for restricting information in                     
              organizations that in turn could lead to techniques for increasing             
              the flow of information.  This project also will provide an                    
              excellent opportunity for a promising young scholar to continue to             
              develop independent research skills.
