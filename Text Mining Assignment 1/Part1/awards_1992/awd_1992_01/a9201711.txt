Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              An ideal species to use for examination of the evolution of                    
              cooperation among unrelated individuals has recently been found -              
              a social insect that occurs in discrete populations, one of which              
              contains cooperative and the other non-cooperative, aggressive                 
              individuals.  The Principal Investigator plans to exploit the                  
              existence of these two social morphs to perform the first                      
              experiments directly testing many of the fundamental precepts of a             
              group-selection hypothesis of the evolution od cooperation.  The               
              behavioral experiments outlined in this proposal also provide the              
              first empirical investigation of whether "group level punishment"              
              of cheaters exist.  In addition, the P.I. will attempt a molecular             
              genetic analysis of cooperative and non-cooperative morphs to                  
              examine whether one morph is "invading the other.  Given the                   
              crucial role social insects have played in the development                     
              of kin selection theory and its eventual transfer to studies of                
              primate and other social systems, insights generated from this                 
              study testing group selection in the evolution of social insect                
              behavior can be expected to be transferable to other social                    
              systems.
