Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Long & Medium-Term Research:  Elementary Photoproduction of                    
              Eta Mesons                                                                     
                                                                                             
              This award is under the Long and Medium-Term Research at                       
              Foreign Centers of Excellence Program, which enables U.S.                      
              scientists and engineers to conduct three to twelve months of                  
              research abroad at research centers of proven excellence.  The                 
              program's awards provide opportunities for joint research, and the             
              use of unique or complementary facilities, expertise and                       
              experimental conditions abroad.                                                
                                                                                             
              This award will support a twelve-month postdoctoral research visit             
              by Dr. Michael M. Rigney of the University of South Carolina to                
              work with Professor G. Noldeke at the University of Bonn.  They                
              plan to explore the elementary photoproduction of the neutral                  
              ETA(n) meson at the existing electron accelerator and stretcher ring           
              ELSA in Bonn.  This accelerator in conjunction with the                        
              PHOENICS Photon Tagging System will be used to measure                         
              differential and total cross sections for n photoproduction a 1H,2D,           
              and 12C.  These measurements will enable them to explore the role              
              played by the P11(1440) Roper resonance in these processes.                    
                                                                                             
              The award recommendation provides funds to cover international                 
              travel, a stipend for twelve months and a dependents' allowance.
