Abstract    :
              Modern construction materials often                                            
              result in lightweight floor systems                                            
              susceptible to transient motion                                                
              imparted by the input forcing                                                  
              function of human locomotion.

              this phenomena must quantify the                                               
              forcing function and efficient

              research will quantify the input                                               
              forcing function of locomotion as a                                            
              truncated Fourier Series whose                                                 
              coefficients are related to human                                              
              physical characteristics.

              indices will then create a                                                     
              statistically based description of

              phase of research will investigate                                             
              the properties of the human body                                               
              which make it an efficient damper.                                             
              Experimental data will be collected

              device will be developed which                                                 
              emulates human body properties to
