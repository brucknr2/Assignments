Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This award will provide supplementary support                                  
              to enable Dr. Harry Bottenberg of the                                          
              University of Illinois to conduct collaborative                                
              research with Dr. Shunichi Miyai for 24 months                                 
              at the Tohoku Agricultural Experiment Station                                  
              in Japan.  They will utilize Bottenberg's                                      
              expertise on insect-born plant virus diseases                                  
              to study the effects temperature has on A.                                     
              solani, the sole vector of soybean dwarf virus                                 
              (SDV).                                                                         
                                                                                             
              SDV, a serious disease of soybeans in Japan and                                
              a potential threat to legume production world-                                 
              wide, is transmitted by an aphid, A. solani,                                   
              that feeds and multiplies on soybeans.  The                                    
              factors that influence the reproduction and                                    
              mortality of this aphid species and the spread                                 
              of SDV are not well understood, although recent                                
              data from Japan suggests that temperature may                                  
              play an important role in these processes.                                     
              Bottenberg and Miyai will investigate the                                      
              impact of temperature on vector population                                     
              growth, vector feeding behavior, vector                                        
              dispersal, SDV transmission, and SDV spread.                                   
              The specimens, fields, and facilities of the                                   
              Experiment Station, as well as Dr. Miyai's                                     
              expertise in A. solani will complement Dr.                                     
              Bottenberg's experience with aphid-born viruses                                
              and will facilitate the development of a                                       
              simulation model that can be used to predict                                   
              and prevent SDV outbreaks and soybean yield                                    
              loss.
