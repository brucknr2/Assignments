Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This project provides a high-resolution 300kV transmission electron            
              microscope (HRTEM) for fundamental studies of microstructures in a             
              variety of materials systems.  The HRTEM will be used in                       
              applications of high-resolution imaging and image simulations, and             
              fine-probe energy-dispersive x-ray spectroscopy to problems                    
              including seeding of ceramic precursors, composite interfaces,                 
              nanocrystalline solids, diamond films, and ferroelectric materials.            
              Both fundamental questions and application-oriented issues                     
              concerning the processing-microstructure-properties links will be              
              addressed.  The HRTEM facility will also serve an educational                  
              purpose in supplying graduate students with hands-on experience in             
              state-of-the-art microstructural analysis. Furthermore, it will                
              provide opportunities for technique development that will go beyond            
              the boundaries of these specific projects.  The HRTEM will be                  
              organized as a user facility with administrative and staff support             
              provided by the Materials Characterization Laboratory at Penn                  
              State, which currently manages operation and maintenance of the                
              existing electron microscopes, x-ray diffraction equipment, ion and            
              electron microprobes, and other user-oriented instruments use for              
              characterization of advanced materials.  This will be one of three             
              instruments of it's kind in the US.
