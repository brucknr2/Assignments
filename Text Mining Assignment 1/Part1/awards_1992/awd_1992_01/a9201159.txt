Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Semiconductor clusters in two very different size ranges                       
              approaching the molecular and materials limits of matter will be               
              studied using a combination of negative ion photodetachment                    
              techniques.  One set of experiments is aimed at the vibrational and            
              electronic spectroscopy of small clusters in the 3-20 atom size                
              range; specific systems of interest included elemental clusters of             
              silicon and germanium as well as mixed III-V GaAs, InP, and InSb               
              clusters.  A comparison of their experimental results with the ab              
              initio calculations of others will provide a detailed probe of how             
              the structure and chemical bonding of these clusters varies with               
              their size.  The second set of experiments focusses on considerably            
              larger semiconductor 'nanocrystals' of CdS and CdSe in the 1000                
              atom size range.  They plan to perform photoelectron spectroscopy              
              on size-selected nanocrystal anions in order to determine the                  
              electron affinities and electronic state energies of the neutral               
              nanocrystals.  These experiments will provide a detailed probe of              
              the effect of quantum confinement on the electronic structure of               
              these species.  In addition, the extent of vibrational excitation              
              in the photoelectron spectrum will reveal the extent of lattice                
              distortion caused by the presence of the additional electron in the            
              nanocrystal anion.                                                             
                                                                                             
              This grant is supported jointly by the Division of Materials                   
              Research, and the Chemistry Division.
