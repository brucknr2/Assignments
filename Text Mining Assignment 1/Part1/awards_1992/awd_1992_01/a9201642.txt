Abstract    :
                   The research will investigate simultaneous adaptive control               
              over two variables of the welding process, seam tracking and weld              
              penetration control.  This will be accomplished by using advanced              
              infrared sensing techniques to monitor the thermal field in the                
              vicinity of the weld pool.  While both theoretical solutions and               
              experiment agree sufficiently to enable dynamic control of either              
              seam tracking or penetration control, the simultaneous                         
              identification, sorting and correction of two or more perturbations            
              presents an immense problem in theoretical and practical analysis.             
                   This research will develop the theoretical and experimental               
              tools to identify, sort and understand changes in surface                      
              temperature distributions resulting from simultaneous,                         
              intentionally induced errors in weld penetration and torch                     
              position.  Theoretical models of heat transfer will be advanced to             
              describe the surface temperature distribution for simultaneous                 
              perturbations in the process.  Computer hierarchial methods of                 
              analyzing the thermal fields and the implementation of the control             
              responses will be developed.  The ultimate result of this research             
              will be the advancement of the scientific basis upon which future              
              machines may be produced that are capable of eliminating defective             
              welds and increasing the productivity of the welding process.
