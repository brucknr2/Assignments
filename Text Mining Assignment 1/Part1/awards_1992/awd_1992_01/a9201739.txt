Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Work is underway to examine how ionic interactions affect the rates            
              of oxidation and reduction of metals and nonmetals in seawater.                
              Measurements of the rates are being made in seawater as a function             
              of pH, salinity, temperature and composition to elucidate the                  
              effect of the ionic components of seawater.  Studies of the                    
              products and intermediates of the reactions will be made (when                 
              possible) in an attempt to elucidate the mechanisms of the                     
              reactions.                                                                     
                                                                                             
              Measurements are continuing on the oxidation of H2S with the oxides            
              of Fe(III) and Mn(IV) in seawater as a function of pH, temperature,            
              and salinity.  The disappearance of H2S and the appearance of                  
              Mn(II) and Fe(II) are being measured.  The effect of pH,                       
              temperature and salinity on S, HSn, SO32, and S2O32 is being studied           
                                                                                             
              The research includes completion of studies on the reduction of                
              Cr(VI) with H2S and the reduction of Cu(II) with H2O2 in natural               
              waters.   Measurements of the stability constants of metals with HS            
              will be continued using a square wave polarographic technique                  
              developed by Luther (Univ. of Delaware) that senses free HS at nM              
              levels.                                                                        
                                                                                             
              New thermodynamic modelling will be carried out on the speciation              
              of divalent and trivalent metals, the carbonate system and the                 
              state of Fe(II) and Fe(III) in seawater.  These studies will                   
              hopefully lead to a consistent set of stability constants and                  
              Pitzer interaction parameters that can be used to characterize                 
              these systems in natural waters.
