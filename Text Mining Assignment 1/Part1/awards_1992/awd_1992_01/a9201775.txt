Abstract    :
                   This award continues support for an effort to develop a                   
              meteorological dropwindsonde for deployment from unmanned aircraft.            
              During Phase I, a unique, potentially very reliable rotary sonde               
              configuration was developed and tested with releases from unmanned             
              aircraft.  During Phase II, the principal investigator and his                 
              colleagues will develop the integrating electronics for systems in             
              the sonde and produce 50 prototype sondes.  These sondes will be               
              able to measure temperature, humidity, pressure, and winds, and                
              will employ the Global Positioning Satellite (GPS) system to                   
              determine location.  A first-generation airborne data acquisition              
              system, which includes high-precision instruments for initializing             
              the sonde instruments (e.g., a Lyman alpha hygrometer to measure               
              water vapor), will be assembled and tested as well.                            
                   The system will have applications in the areas of hurricane               
              tracking, studies of the tropical water vapor budgets, and                     
              meteorological observations in remote areas where rawinsonde                   
              coverage is not presently available.  Although designed for                    
              unmanned aircraft, the system can easily be adapted to almost any              
              manned aircraft.  The system could represent a very significant                
              advancement for meteorological observing, both for research and                
              operational purposes.
