Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This U.S.-Czechoslovakia research project in                                   
              materials science is between Dr. Terence J.                                    
              Langdon of the University of Southern California                               
              and Dr. V. Sklenicka of Institute of Physical                                  
              Metallurgy, Brno, Czechoslovakia.  Creep                                       
              deformation at high temperatures is an important                               
              problem in many industrial applications and the                                
              problem is compounded in those materials, such as                              
              copper-based alloys, which are prone to the                                    
              development of extensive internal cavitation and                               
              ultimately to cavitation failure.  The                                         
              researchers will employ their laboratories'                                    
              extensive experience in the areas of high                                      
              temperature creep and cavitation failure.  They                                
              will conduct high temperature creep tests on                                   
              selected copper-based alloys with the long-term                                
              objective of obtaining a more complete                                         
              understanding of the deformation mechanisms and                                
              the role of grain boundary sliding in the                                      
              development of internal cavities.                                              
                                                                                             
              This project in materials science fulfills the                                 
              program objective of advancing scientific                                      
              knowledge by enabling leading experts in the                                   
              United States and Eastern Europe to combine                                    
              complementary talents and pool resources in areas                              
              of strong mutual interest and competence.
