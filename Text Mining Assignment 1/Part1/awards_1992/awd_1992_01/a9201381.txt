Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This proposal requests support for a one-day symposium entitled:               
              Environmental Sex Determination in Reptiles: Patterns and Processes            
              to be held at the annual meeting of the American Society of                    
              Zoologists in Vancouver, British Columbia, in December, 1992. The              
              symposium consists of two sections: 1. Evolution and Ecology of                
              TSD, and 2. Hormonal and Molecular Mechanisms of TSD. Twelve                   
              speakers will present their latest research on TSD in reptiles                 
              ranging from evolutionary and ecological theory to molecular and               
              hormonal mechanisms. Each of the invited participants has made                 
              significant contributions in this field and will present a concise             
              review of their latest findings. The proceeding of the symposium               
              will be published in the American Zoologist  and funds are also                
              requested to partly defray these additional costs.
