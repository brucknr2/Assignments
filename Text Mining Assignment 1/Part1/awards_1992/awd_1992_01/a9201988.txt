Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                   The Inter-university Consortium for Political and Social                 
              Research (ICPSR),  on behalf of its 360 member institutions,  will             
              conduct a set of activities intended to make readily available the             
              computer-readable data resources from the 1990 U.S. Census of                  
              Population and Housing.  These activities include:  (1) acquisition            
              of substantially all data produced by the 1990 Census;  (2)                    
              provision of multiple modes of access to the data without charge               
              to scholars at ICPSR member institutions and at a nominal charge               
              to individuals at nonmember academic institutions;  (3) provision              
              of custom subsetting capabilities to allow researchers to acquire              
              the data needed for specific research applications;  and (4)                   
              provision of training in the use of 1990 Census data.  The project             
              will receive additional financial support from ICPSR membership                
              dues,  a Joint Statistical Agreement with the U.S. Bureau of the               
              Census,  and a grant from the National Institute on Aging.  The                
              project will be conducted over a three-year period (1992-1995)
