Abstract    :
              These investigators will purchase a computer workstation,                      
              peripheral equipment, and software. The equipment will be                      
              used for modeling studies and molecular dynamics                               
              calculations applied to proteins and nucleic acids, for DNA                    
              sequence searches, and for molecular mechanics calculations                    
              on small molecules.  Enzymes to be studied include                             
              glutathione S-transferase, epoxide hydrolase, 4-                               
              chlorobenzoate dehalogenase, staphylococcal nuclease, and                      
              mandelate racemase.
