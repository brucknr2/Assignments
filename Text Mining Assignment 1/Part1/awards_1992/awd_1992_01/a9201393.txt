Abstract    :
              This research uses the central                                                 
              solution for the commutant lifting                                             
              theorem along with some state space                                            
              techniques to solve mixed L2 - Hoo                                             
              control problems.  Many classical                                              
              linear quadratic control problems                                              
              can be converted to an L2                                                      
              optimization problem.  It is well                                              
              known that these L2 or linear                                                  
              quadratic controllers may not be                                               
              robust.  To get around this problem                                            
              many researchers turned to Hoo                                                 
              optimization.  Although, the Hoo                                               
              controllers are robust, they                                                   
              produce systems with a large                                                   
              bandwidth.  This research will use                                             
              the commutant lifting theorem to                                               
              find controllers  which exhibit the                                            
              appropriate trade off between the                                              
              standard L2 and Hoo controllers.  By                                           
              solving certain mixed L2 - Hoo (four                                           
              block) problems this work will                                                 
              obtain robust controllers with                                                 
              strong linear quadratic                                                        
              performance.  The proofs are based                                             
              on the central solution for the                                                
              commutant lifting theorem.  In the                                             
              rational case the L2 - Hoo                                                     
              controllers will be computed by                                                
              using standard state space                                                     
              techniques.  In the nonrational                                                
              case these controllers will be                                                 
              computed by using the commutant                                                
              lifting theorem, along with some                                               
              skew-Toeplitz techniques.  This                                                
              work will also be extended to                                                  
              certain nonlinear systems involving                                            
              Volterra series.
