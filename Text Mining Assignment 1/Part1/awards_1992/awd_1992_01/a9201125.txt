Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  Over the last 30 years there has been a dramatic increase in              
              the number of women participating in the paid work force, but the              
              change in the proportion of women in senior positions has been very            
              slow.  This doctoral dissertation project utilizes a theory of                 
              organizational learning to explain the selection of women and men              
              for senior positions and how that selection procedure contributes              
              to the low frequency and type of women in senior management                    
              positions.   Based on interviews of ninety-seven women and men                 
              randomly sampled at three levels of management in two companies,               
              beliefs of organizational members who are promoted and those who               
              are not promoted are compared to beliefs about appropriate                     
              managerial behavior and about proper gender behavior that are                  
              imbedded in the organizational code.                                           
                                                                                             
                   This project will contribute to a broader sociological                    
              understanding of what characterizes women who have been promoted               
              to senior positions by elucidating how their behavior is different             
              than some other women in the organization and how organizational               
              inertia is supported through this selection process.  This project             
              also will provide an excellent opportunity for a promising young               
              scholar to continue to develop independent research skills.
