Abstract    :
                   Twelve late Cretaceous angiosperm fossil flower localities                
              in northern New Jersey will be salvages and the materials                      
              prepared for study.  The localities are terrestrial deposits and               
              range in age from upper Cenomanian to upper Turonian and                       
              Santonian.  Preliminary observation indicates these deposits are               
              important because:  (1) angiosperm floral fossils are remarkably               
              abundant; (2) the flowers are remarkably well preserved and                    
              associated with wood, leaves, and insects:  (3) the diversity is               
              unusually broad and includes several major dicot groups and the                
              earliest unequivocal monocots; (4) floral features of some of the              
              samples are typically associated with specialized insect                       
              pollination syndromes.  Consequently, immediate salvage has a                  
              high priority.
