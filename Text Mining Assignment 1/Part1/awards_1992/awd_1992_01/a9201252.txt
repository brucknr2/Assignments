Abstract    :
                   The research project at the Center for Research Scientific                
              Computing (CRSC), North Carolina State University will use                     
              asymptotic analysis with domain decomposition to solve partial                 
              differential equations that arise in the simulation of fluids.                 
              Short-term goals are to apply these techniques to the numerical                
              simulation of high-speed flow.  Longer-term goals include                      
              application to simulation of the fluid flow (and other processes)              
              appropriate for chemical vapor deposition.                                     
                   The asymptotics identifies the dominant physics in each                   
              region, and provides simplified mathematical models for these                  
              regions.  In this way, the physical domain is separated into                   
              regions where different modeling equations govern the solution                 
              (hence this is a heterogeneous domain decomposition).  The use of              
              local mathematical models allows the customization of the                      
              numerical method based on the locally dominant physics.
