Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Spawning periods represent critical times for production and                   
              vulnerable times for harvesting of fish stocks and it is important             
              to understand their causal basis.  This research project explores              
              a new hypothesis in order to explain the patterns of mating in                 
              pelagically-spawning marine fishes: the hypothesis is that,                    
              spawning sites and times are selected in order to improve                      
              fertilization success rates.  Previous studies have shown that for             
              the bluehead wrasse, Thalassoma bifasciatum, the timing of mating              
              varies dramatically between local populations, that mean                       
              fertilization rates are surprisingly low and appeared to be                    
              influenced by turbulence and location on the reef, and that the                
              number of sperm released by males correlates significantly with the            
              size and fecundity of the female with whom they are mating. This               
              project will undertake three interrelated investigations on: 1. the            
              timing of mating, 2. the location of mating, and 3. fertilization              
              success.
