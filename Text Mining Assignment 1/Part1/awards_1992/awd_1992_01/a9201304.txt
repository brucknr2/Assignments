Abstract    :
                   This project unites the mathematical theory of iterated                   
              functions systems with the geophysical (observable) phenomena of               
              rack fractures.  The aim is to determine whether or not rock                   
              fractures can be characterized by iterated function system codes,              
              and if so, what predictive validity these codes might then have                
              for fracture-related phenomena.                                                
                   This award supports the cross-disciplinary efforts and the                
              development of a research collaboration involving quantitative                 
              modelling in the geosciences.  In particular the mathematicians                
              and the geophysicists will focus their attention on mathematical               
              models derived from chaotic dynamics to model and predict rock                 
              fractures and related phenomena.
