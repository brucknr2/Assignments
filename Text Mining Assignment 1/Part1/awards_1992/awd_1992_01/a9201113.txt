Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This award will establish a Laboratory for Computational                       
              Astrophysics (LCA) at the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign             
              as a joint venture between the National Center for Supercomputing              
              Applications and the Department of Astronomy.  At the heart of this            
              laboratory is a new suite of application codes for astrophysical               
              hydrodynamic, magnetohydrodynamic and radiation hydrodynamic                   
              simulations in one, two and three spatial dimensions implemented on            
              NCSA's supercomputers.  Several of these codes are already in use              
              by national researchers on a variety of astrophysical problems.                
              The central goal of the LCA is the development, dissemination and              
              support of community codes for astrophysical simulation of general             
              use to astronomical researchers.
