Abstract    :
              This is an award to support research on a technique to                         
              determine the presence, identity if present and numbers of                     
              pathogenic organisms, if present, in environmental waters.                     
              The technique is based on determination of the nature of                       
              the genetic material that is unique to the different                           
              target pathogens using an analytical procedure that                            
              amplifies the nucleic acid chain of the target organisms                       
              for ease of identification and quantification.  The                            
              research involves concentration of the pathogens using a                       
              rotating membrane ultrafiltration medium and subsequent                        
              detection of the pathogens using the polymerase chain                          
              reaction procedure.                                                            
                                                                                             
              This research addresses limitations of procedures                              
              currently used for determining the microbiological quality                     
              of an environmental water.  These procedures depend on the                     
              analysis for surrogate microorganisms as a step toward                         
              establishing the significance of their presence.   This                        
              project is a renewal of work initiated under NSF Small                         
              Grant for Exploratory Research No. 92-01324 results of                         
              which were utilized to develop the research plan for this                      
              project.
