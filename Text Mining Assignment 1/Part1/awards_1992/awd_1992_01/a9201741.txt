Abstract    :
                   Professor Stopple will work on a new way to look at the                   
              trace of Hecke eigenforms on GL(3) by generalizing an idea of                  
              Zagier on the trace formula for Hecke operators.  He will then                 
              apply this trace formula to the case of non-normal cubic                       
              extensions of the rationals.                                                   
                   Automorphic forms arose out of non-Euclidean geometry in the              
              middle of the nineteenth century.  Both mathematicians and                     
              physicists have thus long realized that many objects of                        
              fundamental importance are non-Euclidean in their basic nature.                
              This field is principally concerned with questions about the                   
              whole numbers, but in its use of geometry and analysis, it                     
              retains connection to its historical roots and thus to problems                
              in areas as diverse as gauge theory in theoretical physics and                 
              coding theory in information theory.
