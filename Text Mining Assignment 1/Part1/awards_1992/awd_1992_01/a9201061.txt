Abstract    :
                   Lauraceae, the avocado family, are one of the most common                 
              tree families in wet forests of Madagascar.  Its species provide               
              local people with timber and spices, while its fruits are an                   
              important food source for the endemic lemurs.  In spite of this                
              importance, the taxonomy of Lauraceae in Madagascar is very                    
              poorly known.  The proposed project will result in a floristic                 
              treatment of Malagasy Lauraceae and will thus make the species of              
              this family accessible to other botanists, foresters, zoologists               
              and other interested scientists.  Results of this project will                 
              also be incorporated in a study of generic boundaries and                      
              relationships of Lauraceae on a worldwide basis.
