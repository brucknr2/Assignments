Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The research to be supported by this award will focus on the origin            
              of spiral structure in galaxies.  Images of approximately 100                  
              galaxies will be examined in order to determine the location of                
              enhanced star formation ridges and other features which will be                
              useful for understanding the dynamics and structure of spiral                  
              galaxies.  This information will also be used to address questions             
              about how strong spiral density waves trigger star formation in the            
              disk of a galaxy, the properties of spiral structure in galaxies,              
              and how environment affects spiral structure.                                  
                                                                                             
              The Principal Investigators are recognized experts in this research            
              area.
