Abstract    :
              This dissertation project is a study of the Nivkhi of Sakhalin                 
              Island, a Paleoasiatic people in the Russian Far East. A  major                
              focus will be placed on the narratives and reflections of these                
              Native people on the past, set against the backdrop of contemporary            
              social change in Russia. In addition to fieldwork, archival                    
              research in St. Petersburg and Tomsk will be carried out.
