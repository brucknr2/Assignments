Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This project examines the use of titanium-aluminum carbides as a               
              possible reinforcement in titanium- and nickel-matrix composites.              
              The process of producing limited amounts of the fibers was                     
              demonstrated previously in a Phase I project.  The fiber is a                  
              titanium/aluminum carbide, Ti3AlC, formed from plasma-assisted                 
              chemical vapor deposition (PACVD) onto a graphite fiber tow.  In               
              the Phase II program the PACVD process is optimized using a                    
              laboratory scale continuous system to produce Ti3AlC                           
              multifilament tows and Ti3AlC deposits on substrates other than                
              graphite.  Attention is directed towards matching coefficient of               
              thermal expansions of the fiber and matrix.  The properties of                 
              the fiber and its performance in metal composites is examined.                 
                                                                                             
              High strength, stable fibers are important for reinforcing metal               
              matrix composites.  Application of the fibers under development                
              here could include composites for structural and engine                        
              components in aerospace systems and energy conversion devices.
