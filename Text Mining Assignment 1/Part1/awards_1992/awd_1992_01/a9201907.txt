Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                                                                                             
                                                                                            
              Work is in progress on the cycling of trace metals between sediment            
              and water in the continental margin of California.  Fluxes of                  
              nutrients and trace metals are being determined by using the USC               
              free vehicle bottom lander and by calculation of gradients in pore             
              waters of sediments on a millimeter scale.  A surprising result of             
              the initial work is that the highest rate of remineralization of               
              metals from the sediment appears to be from well oxygenated waters,            
              not from sediments in the depth range of the oxygen minimum zone.              
              Moreover the high fluxes are linked with high rates of oxygen                  
              consumption, carbon oxidation, and calcium carbonate dissolution.              
              Consequently, new work is addressing the association between metal             
              and carbon cycling.  Measurements of fluxes out of the sediments in            
              Monterey Bay are being compared to ongoing measurements of sediment            
              trap carbon fluxes (by Chavez) to determine whether seasonality in             
              the carbon signal is reflected by remineralization rates of metals.            
              A detailed study is also being made of fluxes derived from                     
              modelling pore water profiles, compared to those from the benthic              
              chambers, which tend to give higher flux values.  The discrepancy              
              suggests rapid diagenetic reactions in the fluff layer at the                  
              sediment surface, or irrigation by infauna; the possibilities are              
              being investigated.
