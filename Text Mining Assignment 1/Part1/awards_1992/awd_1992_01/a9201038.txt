Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  This is a doctoral dissertation proposal to study the                     
              abolition of slavery in Suriname, a former Dutch colony in South               
              America and a Caribbean society.  The research will focus on                   
              changes in the composition and structure of the elite during the               
              19th century.  Archival data will be analyzed and the measurement              
              of structure at several points in time will introduce a dynamic                
              perspective in the study of the interplay of state formation,                  
              ethnicity, and the emergence of elite in post-emancipation                     
              Suriname.                                                                      
                   The study will make contributions to the understanding of                 
              state formation, and the formation of elites, and it will                      
              increase knowledge about Caribbean societies.
