Abstract    :
              The purpose of this research is to develop an Artificial                       
              Intelligence model which will predict the occurrence of task                   
              related injuries.  Proven ergonomic principles will be incorporated            
              into the knowledge base of the expert system.  The goal of the                 
              system is to provide assistance in employee placement, reducing                
              task related injury, and improving workplace conditions.  The                  
              expert system will use fuzzy set theory to make decisions about the            
              level of risk associated with a particular individual and/or task.             
              The three components of input required are personal                            
              characteristics, workplace conditions, and environmental factors.
