Abstract    :
              The objective of this doctoral dissertation research is to use                 
              faunal remains from archaeological sites on Frobisher Bay, Baffin              
              Island, NWT, Canada, to analyze the cultural contacts between                  
              European and Inuit populations. The study will focus on three                  
              aspects of the archaeological record: (1) systematic examination               
              of animal bones from Inuit sites representing different phases of              
              European contact; (2) an analysis of changing Inuit settlement                 
              patterns; (3) differences in butchery patterns relating to the                 
              intoduction of metal trade goods. It is proposed that this study               
              will also shed light on human-animal relations and climate change.
