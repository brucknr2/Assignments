Abstract    :
              Two dozen Korean and American geographers and regional scientists              
              plan to meet in Seoul in November 1992 for a five day conference               
              examining "Geographic Dimensions of National Social and Economic               
              Policy".                                                                       
                                                                                             
              Purpose of the conference is to review and evaluate (1)                        
              contemporary methods for measuring and describing spatial                      
              variations in economic growth, social development, and                         
              environmental quality; (2) the effectiveness of prevailing                     
              development and settlement theories in accounting for such                     
              spatial variations; and (3) ways the state intervenes to reduce                
              spatial inequalities, why it intervenes as it does, and the                    
              extent that policies programs achieve intended results.                        
                                                                                             
              Topics of special interest include housing provision, educational              
              opportunity, health care, income maintenance, women's issues,                  
              general regional economic development, and environmental                       
              protection.  This seminar is jointly supported by NSF and the                  
              Korean Science and Engineering Foundation.
