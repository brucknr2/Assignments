Abstract    :
              A quantitative study of the low frequency absorbate-substrate                  
              vibrations will be undertaken using new far infrared (FIR)                     
              spectroscopic techniques developed at Michigan State Univeristy                
              (MSU).  Both the metastable molecular precursor and the stable                 
              atomic species will be examined.  Absorbate-induced changes in the             
              broad band reflectivity of the substrate will be studied                       
              quantitatively using the MSU apparatus and FIR beamline at the                 
              National Synchrotron Light Source.  Line shapes of the low                     
              frequency modes, the effect of coadsorbed alkali atoms, and atomic             
              adsorption on semiconductor surfaces will also be investigated.                
              Electroreflectance vibrational spectroscopy will be used to probe              
              the subtle effects of applied electrostatic fields.
