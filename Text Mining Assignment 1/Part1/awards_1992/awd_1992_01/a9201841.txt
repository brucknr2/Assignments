Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  This MISETA proposal will measure the zonal drift of kilometer            
              scale irregularities and all sky airglow surface brightnesses in               
              addition to upgrading the Fabry Perot interferometer.  The PIs also            
              plan to compare MISETA observations and predicitons from the                   
              current NCAR-TIGCM model.  The project will focus on the                       
              modification of the Fabry Perot to enable mesospheric dynamics                 
              studies through the doppler measurements of mesospheric airglow                
              emissions in addition to the 630 nm measurements.
