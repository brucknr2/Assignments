Abstract    :
              With their involvement in intelligent structures, and aerospace                
              and nuclear applications, civil engineers must also be concerned               
              about the reliability of the software they develop to control,                 
              sense, and monitor.  Consider for example the high dependability               
              and fault tolerance required of software for active structural                 
              control.  Because these real-time systems operate without a human              
              in the loop, the impact of errors can be particularly                          
              devastating: control system failure could excite the structure                 
              rather than dissipate vibration.  The overall goals of this                    
              research are to examine the impact of reliability issues in real-              
              time, civil engineering software, and to define a practical                    
              methodology, consisting of both predeployment validation and run-              
              time support, that can be used to ensure reliability.  More                    
              specifically, the study will focus on software reliability of                  
              active structural control, and will draw on notions such as                    
              static verification and real-time testing techniques to ensure                 
              software correctness, as well as fault tolerance and redundancy                
              to provide dependable behavior in the presence of hardware and                 
              software errors.  The benefits of this study are expected to                   
              enable the development of reliable, fault-tolerant, real-time                  
              computer software for practical civil engineering applications.
