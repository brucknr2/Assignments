Abstract    :
                   This project aims at completing a biological inventory of                 
              the nearly 10,000 species of plants that inhabit the Amazonian                 
              forests and Guayana Highlands in Southern Venezuela.  The results              
              will be published in an 8-volume illustrated Flora, the first                  
              ever produced for this region.  Records of the species and their               
              distributions will be kept in an expandable computer database.                 
              Volume 1, the introduction to the series, will provide                         
              interpretative and supporting data for the succeeding taxonomic                
              volumes, including large scale vegetation and topographic maps,                
              geographical details of the flora region, and analyses of the                  
              vegetation types and species found int he area.  This volume will              
              be produced in both English and Spanish editions, while the                    
              others will appear in English.                                                 
                   The information obtained from the Flora will be used as the               
              foundation to produce a catalog of all of Venezuela's plants, now              
              estimated at 15,000 species and representing one of the world's                
              richest areas of biodiversity.
