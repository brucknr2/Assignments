Abstract    :
              This project is concerned with                                                 
              questions of safety and reliability                                            
              for controlled structures.  The                                                
              technical issues to be addressed in                                            
              this research include:  (1)                                                    
              quantitative evaluation of enhanced                                            
              reliability against collapse under                                             
              earthquake or wind loads of extreme

              Both passive and active systems, as                                            
              well as combinations (hybrid) of                                               
              both systems will be examined.                                                 
              Probability-based methods will be                                              
              used in order to include the                                                   
              effects of uncertainties.
