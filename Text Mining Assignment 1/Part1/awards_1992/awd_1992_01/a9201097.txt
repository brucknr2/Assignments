Abstract    :
                   This project aims to help with the preparation of three of the            
              projected five volumes of the New Flora of Chile and a database of             
              Chilean plants.  This is a cooperative project among the University            
              of Concepcion, Chile, the Missouri Botanical Garden, The Ohio State            
              University, the University of Reading, England, and the University             
              of Munich.  More the 50 international specialists in various plant             
              groups are already participating in this project.  The finished                
              work will be the first complete modern Flora for any country in                
              South America, and will stimulate both basic and applied research              
              in Chile and other parts of South America, as well as serving as an            
              important reference for ongoing work in other countries.  This                 
              Flora will also allow informed management of Chile's natural                   
              resources, and with the database will serve as test model for                  
              preparation of other country-wide Floras.                                      
                   About 49% of the native flora of Chile is endemic to that                 
              country, a high proportion more typical of oceanic islands than                
              continental areas.  This highly unusual native flora is not will               
              known, but at the same time is under severe pressure from habitat              
              destruction in response to economic pressures, particularly export             
              logging and agriculture.  Study and management of the cooperation              
              is necessary to allow Chile to complete an inventory of its flora              
              in the time available.
