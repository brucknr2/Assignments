Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  The object of this proposal is to upgrade the computers and               
              radar hardware at the Sondrestrom Facility.  The PIs feel this will            
              better enable the use of a data-acquisition system that provides               
              greater flexibility in radar operating modes.  In addition, the PI             
              proposes to extend the capabilities of the data-acquisition system,            
              improve the radar circuits that limit existing operating modes, and            
              extend the facility computer power to allow on-site data reduction             
              with fitting software.
