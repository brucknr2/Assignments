Abstract    :
                   This project addresses Bayesian nonparametric procedures                  
              which  incorporate information about the mean and about the tail               
              behavior of the sampling distribution.  Extensions to non-random               
              samples from finite populations may be developed, drawing on a                 
              Bayesian theory of randomization.  Extensions for censored data                
              in the presence of covariates should also follow.                              
                   Foundational issues for Bayesian theory of statistical                    
              inference revolve around assembling past information or prior                  
              opinion with new information or data and then presenting the                   
              amalgamated view.  The inclusion of subjective views with                      
              information from observations has important implications for                   
              the applications of Bayesian inference and for effective                       
              statistically-based prediction and decisions.  This research                   
              examines both fundamental mathematical issues and their                        
              applications to specific scientific questions.
