Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  This proposal focuses on the installation of an enhanced                  
              Fabry-Perot Interferometer (FPI) located in the CEDAR optical                  
              facility at Millstone Hill Observatory.  The improved FPI will                 
              enable the observation of several different nightglow emissions as             
              the new instrument is integrated into the observing program at                 
              Millstone Hill.  The PIs will emphasize (1) continuation of                    
              existing F-region studies using the atomic oxygen 630 nm line and              
              (2) observation of D- and E-region emissions (e.g. oxygen, OH).
