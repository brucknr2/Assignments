Abstract    :
                   The principal investigator will develop and improve methods               
              for understanding the stability of nonlinear waves as solutions                
              of partial differential equations which arise in a number of                   
              scientific fields.  In one particular case, he will use ideas he               
              has recently developed to establish the exponential decay rate                 
              for nonlinear perturbations in solitary wave problems for KdV-                 
              type equations.                                                                
                   The qualitative analysis of nonlinear waves for such systems              
              is of significant scientific interest in view of the wide spread               
              occurrence of such phenomena in real world situations.
