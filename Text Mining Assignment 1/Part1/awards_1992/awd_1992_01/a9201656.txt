Abstract    :
              Magnetic ternary graphite intercalation compounds (GICs) make it               
              possible to allow the study of the cross-over from 2-dimensional               
              (2D) to 3-dimensional (3D) systems, the testing of existing                    
              theories of 2D physics, and investigation of the associated                    
              randomness in 2D systems.  The proposed study is to synthesize and             
              measure the physical properties of magnetic ternary GICs such as a             
              random mixture GICs (RMGICs) and graphite bi-intercalation                     
              compounds (GCICs).  The measurements will be made using ac and dc              
              magnetic susceptibility, ac calorimetry, electrical resistivity,               
              neutron scattering, X-ray scattering, and electron microprobe                  
              techniques.
