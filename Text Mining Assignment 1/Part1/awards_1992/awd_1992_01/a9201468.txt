Abstract    :
                   This research is concerned with problems in commutative                   
              algebra, algebraic geometry and computational issues in those                  
              fields.  In commutative algebra, the principal investigator will               
              study linear resolutions and Huneke's question on the structure                
              of free resolutions.  In algebraic geometry, he will consider a                
              generalized Castelnuovo conjecture, the family of compactified                 
              Jacobians by projective stability, degeneracy of secant and                    
              tangent varieties by methods from differential geometry, as well               
              as ribbons, K3 carpets and supermanifolds.  The computational                  
              parts of this project are concerned with criteria for systems of               
              parameters and development of the computer algebra system,                     
              Macaulay.                                                                      
                   This is research in the field of algebraic geometry, one of               
              the oldest parts of modern mathematics, but one which has had a                
              revolutionary flowering in the past quarter-century.  In its                   
              origins, it treated figures that could be defined in the plane by              
              the simplest equations, namely polynomials.  Nowadays, the field               
              makes use of methods not only from algebra, but from analysis and              
              topology, and conversely is finding application in those fields,               
              as well as, in theoretical computer science and robotics.
