Abstract    :
              This project involves characterization of structural defects on                
              crystals, as well as investigations of the role of these defects in            
              surface atomic diffusion.  The mechanisms by which atoms move on               
              surfaces to produce morphology changes and surface phase                       
              transitions will be studied.  The major experimental methods for               
              the structural and kinetic studies will be scanning tunneling                  
              microscopy, low energy electron diffraction, and surface x-ray                 
              diffraction.  Experiments will be performed on semiconductors                  
              (silicon, germanium and gallium arsenide) and on metal single                  
              crystals.
