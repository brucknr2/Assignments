Abstract    :
                   To stimulate interest and activity in mathematical research,              
              the National Science Foundation each year supports a number of                 
              NSF-CBMS Regional Research Conferences in the Mathematical                     
              Sciences.  Each five-day conference features a distinguished                   
              lecturer who delivers ten lectures on a topic of important                     
              current research in one sharply focused area of the mathematical               
              sciences.  The lecturer subsequently prepares an expository                    
              monograph based upon these lectures, which is normally published               
              by the American Mathematical Society or the Society for                        
              Industrial and Applied Mathematics, or jointly by the American                 
              Statistical Association and the Institute of Mathematical                      
              Statistics.  Certain features differentiate these conferences                  
              from typical research conferences.  These are: (1) Focus on a                  
              single important and timely area of research by a leading                      
              practitioner, (2) Continued effect and local stimulation through               
              regional emphasis, (3) Panel review for quality, breadth, and                  
              timeliness, and (4) Published monographs for a wider audience.                 
                   This grant is to the Conference Board of the Mathematical                 
              Sciences (CBMS) to help fund its activities in promoting,                      
              administering, and providing support services for the conference               
              series.
