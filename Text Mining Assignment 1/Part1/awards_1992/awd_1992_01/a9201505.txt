Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This award will provide supplementary support                                  
              to enable Dr. Dorothy Rountree of Duke                                         
              University to conduct collaborative research                                   
              with Dr. Sho Sakurai for 12 months at Kanazawa                                 
              University in Japan.  Rountree and Sakurai will                                
              utilize Rountree's expertise in molecular                                      
              endocrinology to investigate ketoreductase and                                 
              its role in regulating insect physiology and                                   
              development.                                                                   
                                                                                             
              Insects are encased by a chitinous exoskeleton                                 
              which is shed or molted when the insects grow.                                 
              This molting process is controlled by a family                                 
              of steroid hormones known as ecdysteroids.                                     
              Synthesis of these ecdysteroids in the insect's                                
              prothoracic glands is triggered by the release                                 
              of a prothoracicotropic hormone (PTTH),                                        
              ecdysone, from the insect's brain.  Recently                                   
              another ecdysteroid, 3-dehydro-ecdysone, was                                   
              discovered to be the PTTH secreted by some                                     
              insects.  This PTTH is reduced to ecdysone by                                  
              an enzyme, ketoreductase.  Dr. Sakurai is                                      
              currently the world's premier investigator of                                  
              ketoreductase and Dr. Rountree's experience                                    
              with molecular and endocrine techniques will                                   
              facilitate the study of ketoreductase at the                                   
              molecular and genetic level, providing                                         
              information on the enzyme's vital regulatory                                   
              role in insect development.
