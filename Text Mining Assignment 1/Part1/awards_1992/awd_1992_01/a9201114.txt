Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Description:  This project supports cooperative study by a team                
              of Myanmar geologists and geophysicists headed by U. Tin Myint of              
              the Myanmar Oil and Gas Enterprise, and a team of U.S. scientists              
              headed by Dr. Michael Fuller of the University of California,                  
              Santa Barbara.  The study will be a paleomagnetic effort to help               
              establish the tectonic history of that country.  Paleomagnetism                
              is a suitable way for documenting the effects of the Indian-Asia               
              collision and also contributes to the understanding of the                     
              accretionary processes, whereby Myanmar became a part of Asia.                 
              This work will complement studies being carried out under NSF/EAR              
              grant.                                                                         
                                                                                             
              Scope:  This research will benefit greatly from participation of               
              scientists from Myanmar who have access to data, and to field                  
              facilities that would not be easily available, independently, to               
              foreign scientists.  The visits of the Myanmar scientists to the               
              laboratory at U.C. Santa Barbara will help break a near total                  
              isolation from the west, and enhance the potential for future                  
              collaboration with that country.  The project meets the                        
              objectives of the Science in Developing Countries Program.
