Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This U.S.-Mexico award will support Professor Sidney                           
              Yakowitz of the University of Arizona in a research                            
              collaboration with Professor Onesimo Hernandez Lerma                           
              of the Centro de Investigacion y de Estudios                                   
              Avanzados del IPN (CINVESTAV) in Mexico City,                                  
              Mexico.  The purpose of the research is to develop                             
              and extend recent innovative analytical techniques                             
              in the field of optimal and adaptive control of                                
              controlled Markov processes.  Of major interest is                             
              the development of non-parametric adaptive                                     
              estimation and control methods, and the use of                                 
              machine learning methods to deal with realistic                                
              situations when the model of the system is not                                 
              completely known in advance.                                                   
                                                                                             
              Controlled Markov processes are mathematical                                   
              descriptions of the evolution and control of                                   
              processes that involve sequential decision-making                              
              under uncertainty.  Quality of information,                                    
              inaccurate models, and computational implementation                            
              are important issues.  The Mexican PI is widely                                
              acknowledged to be an authority on optimal and                                 
              adaptive control of adaptive control of Markov                                 
              processes, while the U.S. PI will bring to the                                 
              collaboration, his expertise in statistical and                                
              probabilistic methods and the theory of machine                                
              learning.  This wide range of complementary skills                             
              makes it likely that the work will yield advances in                           
              the design and analysis of new techniques in this                              
              field.
