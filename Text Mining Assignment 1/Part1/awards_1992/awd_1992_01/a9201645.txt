Abstract    :
                   Quorum based protocols are formalized in terms of data structures         
              called "quorum structures."  Several attempts have been made to obtain         
              optimal quorum structures in terms of various measures, such as                
              availability and quorum size.  However, the number of quorums under a          
              set of nodes U may be exponential in ?U!, and many essential                   
              computations on quorum structures, such as availability analysis,              
              become intractable as the number of nodes becomes large.  Thus,                
              obtaining "optimal" quorums under a large set of nodes is extremely            
              difficult.                                                                     
                   This research will investigate transformations of quorum                  
              structures which take quorum structures as input and return new quorum         
              structures.  In particular, transformations will be defined which:             
                                                                                             
                         1.  generate a new structure under a substantially larger           
                             set of nodes than the input quorum structures, and              
                                                                                             
                         2.  preserve certain desirable properties of the input              
                             structures, or convert input structures into a                  
                             structure with desirable properties.                            
                                                                                             
                   Such transformations are extremely useful to generate "good"              
              quorum structures under a large set of nodes for the following                 
              reasons:                                                                       
                                                                                             
                         1.  quorum structures which have certain desirable                  
                             properties may be easily constructed even under a large         
                             set of nodes, and                                               
                                                                                             
                         2.  a divide and conquer approach may be used for                   
                             computations on the quorum structures constructed by            
                             such transformations.  This enables such computations           
                             as availability analysis which are otherwise                    
                             "intractable."
