Abstract    :
              An investigation of the chemical and physical consequences of                  
              captodative radical stabilization will be conducted for a                      
              series of 2-oxomorpholinyl-3-yl radical species. The extent of                 
              radical stabilization by captodative effects will  be                          
              determined by photoacoustic calorimetry and photovoltammetry.                  
              In addition to the characterization of the reductive properties                
              of captodative radicals, their ultimate use as centers for high                
              spin polymers will be assessed by synthesis of amide coupled                   
              oligomers and polymers. Dihydropyrazines derived from the                      
              oxomorpholine structures will be employed to make conductive CT                
              complexes with a variety of strong electron acceptors.

              This grant from the Organic Dynamics Program suppports the                     
              continuing investigation by Professor T. A. Koch at the                        
              University of Colorado. A study of radical species stabilized                  
              in a unique manner by groups attached to the molecule which are                
              able to push and pull electrons by virtue of the electronic                    
              nature will be conducted. A particular interesting part of the                 
              research will focus on the ability of specially designed                       
              molecules of this variety to form complexes with electron                      
              acceptor compounds which are capable of conducting electricity.                
              In addition, it is proposed to utilize these radical species in                
              polymers to generate materials which have unique magnetic                      
              properties. Such materials have potential applications in                      
              fabrication of electrical devices.
