Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The investigator will complete the interpretation and mapping of               
              the seafloor geology of areas surrounding North America.  The study            
              will synthesize submarine geological and geophysical data collected            
              over several decades.  The remaining two quadrants off the western             
              North American coast will be completed.
