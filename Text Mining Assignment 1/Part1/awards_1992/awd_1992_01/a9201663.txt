Abstract    :
              This project is in the general area of analytical and surface                  
              chemistry and in the subfield of separations science.  During the              
              tenure of this three-year continuing grant, Professor Guiochon                 
              and his students will investigate the influence of the                         
              thermodynamics and kinetics of phase equilibria on chromatographic             
              separations performed at high concentrations.  This research,                  
              which builds upon results obtained under NSF grant CHE-8901382,                
              addresses the theoretical basis for liquid chromatography at high              
              concentrations and the experimental verification of that                       
              theoretical basis.  This work includes studies of nonlinear,                   
              nonideal systems that are common to both preparative scale and                 
              analytical chromatography.

              This research is of both theoretical and practical significance                
              and has as a goal the development of preparative scale separations             
              that are of critical importance in biotechnology.
