Abstract    :
              This investigation addresses the role played by winds, electric                
              fields, and ionospheric plasma layers in the 100-200 km altitude               
              regime focusing on the determination of plasma layer                           
              distributions.  This region is regularly populated by "sporadic,"              
              "intermediate," "descending," and/or "sequential" layers, with                 
              sufficiently high plasma content to play an important role in E-               
              and F-region coupling processes and to influence the global-scale              
              electrodynamic circuit.  There is no global model of these                     
              layers, nor is there an empirical baseline to define their global              
              distributions and their diurnal, seasonal, and solar-cycle                     
              controls.  This void will be addressed by organizing and                       
              analyzing the international SUNDIAL database, and employing the                
              SUNDIAL suite of ground-based diagnostic techniques, with                      
              emphasis on a new low cost analysis procedure.                                 
              We will compare the data with the predictions of the NCAR/TIGCM                
              provided by Dr. R. Roble.  This will provide important tests of                
              the uniqueness and validity of the code's input conditions; and                
              it will make possible a self-consistent investigation into the                 
              contributing roles of meridional and zonal wind-shear forces,                  
              electric fields, and ion composition.
