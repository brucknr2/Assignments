Abstract    :
                   The investigator continues research in matrix inequalities                
              and their applications.  The objectives of this project are to                 
              (a) extend the perturbation theory for functions of matrices, and              
              develop efficient algorithms to compute the condition number for               
              these functions, (b) derive good perturbation bounds for matrix                
              factorizations, (c) extend the theory of matrix norms, in                      
              particular unitary similarity invariant norms, and the induced                 
              norms of Hadamard multipliers.  Projects (a) and (b) have                      
              applications in numerical linear algebra.  The problems of (c)                 
              are of interest in their own right and are relevant to obtaining               
              the results in (a) and (b).                                                    
                   There are some unavoidable errors in numerical calculations.              
              For example, whenever calculations are done by computer there is               
              the possibility that small roundoff errors will be incurred --                 
              for example, 1/3 = 0.333333... may approximated by 0.3333.                     
              Another source of errors is that the input data may be the result              
              of measurements that are not exact.  It is possible that these                 
              small errors can cause a large error in the final answer -- so                 
              large that it is useless.  The investigator studies the effects                
              of small errors in numerical linear algebraic calculations.  This              
              will help one to decide whether a particular method of                         
              calculation produces reliable results, and to know in advance                  
              what accuracy is needed in measurements to ensure a given                      
              accuracy in the final answer.
