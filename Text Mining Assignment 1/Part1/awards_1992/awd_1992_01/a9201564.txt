Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Under this project, the Hierarchical Data Format(HDF) scientific               
              data format, which has been developed by the National Center for               
              Supercomputing Applications, will be extended to add the ability               
              to use interfaces and libraries from another popular file format,              
              netCDF.  This should enhance use of HDF and associated scientific              
              visualization tools in the atmospheric and aeronautic research                 
              communities, and position HDF as one of only a very few data                   
              formats which are used by all major data manipulation and                      
              visualization applications across all the scientific and                       
              engineering disciplines supported by the NSF.
