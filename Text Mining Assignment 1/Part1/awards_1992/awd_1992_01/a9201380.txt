Abstract    :
                   This award will allow the continued improvement of the                    
              mammal collection at the University of Alaska Museum (UAM).                    
              Specifically, PIs will catalog retroactively 10,000 specimens,                 
              construct a database and begin verification of the entire                      
              collection (28,000 specimens), enhance the frozen tissue                       
              collection (currently at 700 specimens) and establish a permanent              
              collection manager position.  The UAM mammal collection is the                 
              only regional resource readily accessible to state, federal and                
              academic scientists in Alaska for research and education on                    
              mammals from the Arctic and Subarctic biomes.  UAM is the de                   
              facto natural history museum for Alaska and continues to be the                
              central repository for voucher material arising from                           
              environmental management studies and other research projects.                  
              Recently, UAM became the repository for frozen tissues (with                   
              vouchers) from NBS and NOAA projects in Alaska.  The improved                  
              collection will be widely used in research and education on the                
              biology and game management of Arctic and subarctic mammals.
