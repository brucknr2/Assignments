Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Ecological theories that explain why groups of animals are                     
              a given size provide the hottest debates in ecology today.  The                
              Yunnan snub-nosed monkey (Colobinae: Rhinopithecus bieti) is                   
              unusual in that it lives in coniferous forests, has uncommon                   
              food resources (moss and lichen), and shows a striking pattern                 
              of social and spacing behavior, including group sizes of up to                 
              250 individuals.  Given the large group sizes and uncommon food                
              resources, the Yunnan snub-nosed monkey presents an excellent                  
              opportunity to test theories of grouping behavior that suggest                 
              a relationship between the distribution of food resources and                  
              the size of social groups.                                                     
                                                                                             
              The study will take place in northwestern Yunnan, the                          
              People's Republic of China.  The Yunnan snub-nosed monkey lives                
              only in China, is extremely rare (only 2,000 individuals                       
              remain), and receives top-level protection under Chinese law.                  
              The study will provide vital information for conservation                      
              managers currently working to protect this species.  This                      
              project, furthermore, will train Chinese scientists and nature                 
              reserve staff in advanced techniques for research and                          
              conservation.
