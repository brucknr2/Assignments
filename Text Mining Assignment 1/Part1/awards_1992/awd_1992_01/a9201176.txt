Abstract    :
              Research from the mid-1980s has indicated that academic-industry               
              relations in fields closely allied to genetics may have                        
              significant effects on research activities, including the                      
              academic and commercial productivity of involved industries and                
              scientists, as well as levels of secrecy, openness of                          
              communication and the direction of research in academic labs.                  
              Much remains to be learned about the long-term significance of                 
              these potential effects.  This grant provides funds to permit the              
              development of an ethics component in a large scale study of                   
              academic-industry relationships in genetics and life sciences,                 
              being supported through the National Institutes of Health.  This               
              support allows a philosopher and a sociologist to collaborate in               
              developing the ethics component, and in conducting and analysing               
              results from case studies and surveys of researchers who have                  
              received awards from the Human Genome Research program as well as              
              other academic life scientists.  The ethical topics deserving                  
              exploration include traditional scientific norms and                           
              counternorms, and also new areas of concern including research,                
              organizational, and interpersonal misconduct.  Project results                 
              will be disseminated through books, articles, and presentations                
              at professional associations and relevant meetings.
