Abstract    :
              This project is in the general area of analytical and surface                  
              chemistry and in the subfield of analytical mass spectrometry.                 
              During the tenure of this three-year continuing grant, Professor               
              Wilkins and his students will extend and expand investigations in              
              applications of Fourier transform mass spectrometry (FTMS) that                
              were initiated under the aegis of NSF grant CHE-8911685.  Analyte              
              ion formation by both matrix assisted laser desorption (MALD) and              
              by surface induced dissociation (SID) for subsequent                           
              characterization by FTMS will be studied.  Professor Wilkins will              
              also continue the development of coupled gas chromatography,                   
              infrared spectrometry, and mass spectrometry as a sensitive tool               
              for the analysis of complex mixtures.  Additionally, he will                   
              investigate the analytical capabilities of the combined techniques             
              of supercritical fluid chromatography (SFC) and FTMS.

              This research continues the development of powerful analytical                 
              techniques that are applicable to a broad array of chemical                    
              systems.
