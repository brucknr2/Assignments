Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Drs. Weller and Hosom request funding for initial development of               
              documentation for Improved Meteorological (IMET) sensors.  More                
              accurate meteorological data is required for many of the research              
              efforts planned as part of the World Ocean Circulation Experiment              
              (WOCE), which will begin field experiments in 1992.  Although                  
              many sensors are available commercially, their accuracy and                    
              calibration for ships and buoys had not been tested until                      
              recently.  Work completed in an initial grant to the PI's (OCE-                
              87-09614) quantified the performance characteristics of some of                
              the buoy and ship sensors, and cooperation between the PI's and                
              manufacturers resulted in improvements to the sensors.                         
              Development of a data logging system that is applicable to any                 
              sensor was also completed and licensed to a commercial                         
              manufacturer.                                                                  
                                                                                             
              Although the IMET sensors are now available commercially, they                 
              will not function at specified WOCE standards without proper                   
              calibration and installation, which will be unique for each UNOLS              
              vessel.  As stated in the proposal, "Since the development of                  
              IMET was carried out at WHOI, the expertise to document the                    
              system and carry out initial system installation on several ships              
              currently resides only at WHOI."  This proposal requests funds to              
              begin the documentation of the expertise that has been developed               
              at WHOI so that the information will be available for all UNOLS                
              operators.  This information in needed to provide accurate                     
              meteorological data to researchers as soon as possible.
