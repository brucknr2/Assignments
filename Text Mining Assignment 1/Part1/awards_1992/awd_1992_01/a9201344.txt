Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                                                                                             
                                                                                            
              This research project is a study of the dissolution of CaCO3 that              
              results from the oxic degradation of organic matter in sediments               
              overlain by supersaturated bottom waters.  The work centers on                 
              determining the amounts of dissolution occurring over a range of               
              depths and saturation states.  The sampling and analysis scheme is             
              designed to permit study of the stoichiometry of oxic organic                  
              matter degradation/CaCO3 dissolution, to constrain the rate constant           
              of dissolution through analysis and modelling, and to evaluate the             
              equilibrium constant for dissolution of sedimentary CaCO3.  The                
              field site is the Ceara Rise, and a transect from the crest of the             
              Rise to the adjacent floor will be the source of pore water                    
              profiles of chemical species produced or consumed during organic               
              carbon oxidation and CaCO3 dissolution.  The samples will be taken             
              by means of an in situ Whole Core Squeezer.  This work is being                
              coordinated with a separate project by Reimers to study pore water             
              chemistry at the site with a microelectrode profiler technique, and            
              another by Jahnke to measure benthic fluxes of the same parameters             
              with a benthic flux chamber.
