Abstract    :
                   Parque Nacional "Noel Kempff Mercado" is one of only three                
              functioning biological reserves in the Andean country of Bolivia.              
              Several preliminary inventories of its flora and fauna have been               
              conducted by U.S.-based scientists and have consisted of short term            
              visits during the dry season. This new project is a joint effort by            
              two Bolivian research institutions and the Missouri Botanical                  
              Garden. Project personnel will conduct an extensive plant inventory            
              over a three year period, during wet and dry seasons, and the                  
              results will be incorporated into a computerized Geographical                  
              Information System that will be used to formulate management plans             
              for the park and surrounding areas. Bolivia's largest forest                   
              reserves are adjacent to the park, and rational stewardship of                 
              these resources including surrounding watersheds requires                      
              information about the plants, their habitat preferences and                    
              flowering and fruiting schedules, and geographical distributions.              
              A significant component of the research involves training and                  
              research with host country botanists and students.
