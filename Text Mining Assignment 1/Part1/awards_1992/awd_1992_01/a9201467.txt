Abstract    :
                   This award supports the research of Professor Glen Hurlbert               
              for research in graph theory and other areas of combinatorics.                 
              Professor Hurlbert will study universal cycles and partially                   
              ordered sets as well as problems in combinatorial number theory                
              and combinatorial geometry.                                                    
                   Graph Theory go back perhaps two hundred years, but only in               
              the last half-century has the field become an active, fertile,                 
              and flourishing branch of mathematics.  A graph is a network of                
              lines ("edges") joining points ("vertices"), thus the language of              
              graphs becomes a natural way of describing interrelationships                  
              among separated objects.  Graph Theory figures most prominently                
              as an essential tool in Communications Theory and Computer                     
              Science.  Combinatorics attempts to find efficient methods to                  
              study how discrete collections of objects can be organized.  And,              
              so it to is extremely important to modern communications.
