Abstract    :
              Issues concerning individual

              one of the primary focuses of

              view has been that when seismic                                                
              building provisions are taken into                                             
              consideration, the effects of an                                               
              earthquake on the urban fabric                                                 
              would be similar to the aggregate                                              
              effects on individual buildings in                                             
              the total urban environment.

              and physical urban patterns are                                                
              strongly interrelated.  The complex
