Abstract    :
                   Professor Gay and his coworkers will undertake three                      
              investigations involving the scattering of polarized electrons by              
              Atoms and molecules.  (1) Superelastic scattering of the spin                  
              polarized electrons from energy-rich, long-lived atomic excited                
              states.  In superelastic scattering some of the internal energy                
              of the atom transfers to the kinetic energy of the electron at                 
              the time of collision.  (2) The effect of helicity or                          
              "handedness" in electron scattering.  Many naturally occurring                 
              molecules have one handedness but not the other but not both--                 
              this study is a search for the fundamental physical reason behind              
              this "natural" preference.  (3) A systematic study of helium                   
              excitation and subsequent fluorescence to determine if this                    
              process can be made a highly accurate standard for electron                    
              polarimetry.
