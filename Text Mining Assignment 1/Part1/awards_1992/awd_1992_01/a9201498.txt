Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The Center for Theory and Simulation in Science and Engineering                
              at Cornell University (Cornell Theory Center) proposes a                       
              collaboration with the Center for Research on Parallel                         
              Computation (CRPC),  headquartered at Rice University, for                     
              research in the development of scaleable parallel programs in a                
              scientific programming environment.                                            
                                                                                             
              Ken Kennedy;s research group at Rice has developed a prototype                 
              parallel programming environment called ParaScope ?4,5,6!.                     
              Cornell is one of about twenty sites that have received this                   
              software for testing and evaluation.  We propose to work together              
                                                                                             
              to evaluate and deploy this software.  The goal of the proposed                
              research is twofold:  (1) to see how useful such an environmen is              
                                                                                             
              for scientific programming, and (2) to determine how extensible                
              such and environment is, in scaleability and retargeting to                    
              different manchines.                                                           
                                                                                             
              The time is ripe for such a study because of the tool's maturity               
                                                                                             
              and because of the growing need to retarget user programs quickly              
                                                                                             
              to new systems.  The High Performance Computing and                            
              Communications Initiative will further encourage the                           
              proliferation of parallel systems as new approaches to parallel                
              computing are explored.  For the next five years, rapid change in              
                                                                                             
              our field demands parallel programming tools such as Parascope                 
              that can be quickly adapted to support new target parallel                     
              architectures.
