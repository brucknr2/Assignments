Abstract    :
                   During the last decade many flexible assembly systems (FASs)              
              have been adopted as alternatives to traditional labor-driven                  
              systems, and the number is expected to grow faster than ever.                  
              Design aids for such capital-intensive systems, however, have not              
              been investigated in depth.  Even existing ones are not adequate               
              for real application because of simplicity of the underlying                   
              assumptions, treatment of isolated design issues, time-consuming               
              techniques, and no machine flexibility consideration.                          
                   Emphasis will be on an integrated design-aid tool for FASs                
              which overcomes these setbacks.  This tool will take three basic               
              data (products, machines, and material handling systems) as input              
              and provide cost-effective flow system designs (layout and                     
              operating policies) which satisfy target production requirements.              
              The tool will employ two phases of analyses:  rough-cut analysis               
              and detailed analysis.  The tool will model FAS aspects such as                
              failure-prone machines, parallel-server stations, limited machine              
              flexibility, finite buffer spaces, material handling delays,                   
              precedences among tasks, and a real-time pallet dispatch policy.
