Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  The complex interplay between economic and political                      
              conditions and the nature and amount of informal economic                      
              activity, such as streetvending, has received little attention.                
              This doctoral dissertation will examine the relationships between              
              policies toward street vending, and degrees of economic                        
              stability, political stability, and the level of organization for              
              political action among the streetvendors themselves.  In                       
              particular, it will examine the nature of the conflict between                 
              streetvendors, city officials, and economic interest groups                    
              opposed to the presence of street trading in Mexico City, during               
              two time periods, one of stringent regulation and one of an                    
              uneasy truce.  Archival sources, newspaper reports, interviews                 
              with current and previous officials and streetvendor leaders,                  
              interviews with streetvendors, and ethnographic fieldwork in a                 
              few selected street market areas will be used to illuminate the                
              process of the regulation of streetvending in one of the largest,              
              fastest growing, and most congested cities in the developing                   
              world.                                                                         
                                                                                             
                   This project will contribute to social scientific                         
              understanding of the political and economic factors shaping the                
              construction and enforcement of regulatory policy.  This project               
              also will provide an excellent opportunity for a promising young               
              scholar to continue to develop independent research skills.
