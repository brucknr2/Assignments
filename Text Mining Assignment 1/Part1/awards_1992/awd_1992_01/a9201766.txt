Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  Neither neo-classical economics--human capital theory--nor                
              the neo-structuralist approach alone explain the patterning of                 
              labormarket outcomes.  Both approaches overlook the                            
              organizational level process which not only embodies structural                
              influences, whether due to sectoral segmentation, industrial                   
              effect, or class position, but also recognizes that these                      
              influences mediate labor market outcomes.  This doctoral                       
              dissertation project will examine the nature of organizational                 
              effects on wage policy using Occupational Wage Survey data and                 
              Manufacturing Sector Wage Survey data pertaining to Korea.                     
                                                                                             
                   This project will contribute to sociological and social                   
              scientific understandings of the role of organizations in labor                
              markets by analyzing and drawing on the elements of the                        
              neo-classical and neo-structuralist paradigms in order to develop              
              a single coherent theory.  This project also will provide an                   
              excellent opportunity for a promising young scholar to continue                
              to develop independent research skills.
