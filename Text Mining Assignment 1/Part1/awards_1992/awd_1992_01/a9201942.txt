Abstract    :
              The overall aim of this research project is to define the molecular            
              mechanisms involved in iron-mediated regulation of gene expression             
              in Escherichia coli, using the complex genetic system encoding                 
              components responsible for the biosynthesis (ent), transport (fep)             
              and iron removal (fes) this 22 kb gene cluster is now                          
              characterized; the six ent biosynthesis genes, fes five fep                    
              transport genes, and three genes of unknown function are arranged              
              as four polycistronic and two monocistronic operons, the expression            
              of which are controlled by three bidirectional promoter operation              
              regions that interact with the repressor molecule, Fe(II)-Fur.  The            
              objectives of the current study are: (i) to continue the molecular             
              analysis of nucleotide sequences required for iron-controlled                  
              expression of ent-fep region genes and the interaction of these                
              sequences with Fur and other regulatory factors; (ii) to continue              
              examination of the role of untranslated leader regions of some of              
              the mRNAs in the ultimate expression of these genes; and (iii) to              
              investigate the regulation, localization and potential function of             
              the fepE gene product, a membrane protein of as yet unknown                    
              function.  In this last aim, we will pursue whether this protein,              
              along with the products of the two other uncharacterized ent region            
              genes (P43 and P15), function to control ent-fep gene expression in            
              response to environmental fluctuations.                                        
              %%%                                                                            
              These studies will provide a molecular model for iron-mediated                 
              control of enterobactin gene expression as complex metabolic                   
              pathway requiring coordination between biosynthetic and transport              
              components.  In addition, they will provide a foundation for                   
              initiating a molecular investigation of the complex metabolic and              
              regulatory interrelationships between the iron (Fur) region and                
              other global stress response systems
