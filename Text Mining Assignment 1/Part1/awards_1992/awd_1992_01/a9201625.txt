Abstract    :
              The work aims to develop understanding on toughness                            
              microstructure relations in selected polymeric composites.  The                
              matrices investigated are the polycarbonate and polybutylene                   
              terphthalate.  Improved understanding of mechanisms of toughening              
              associated with crack wake effects and crack front toughening is               
              sought.  The fracture toughness will be investigated by                        
              J-Integral fracture mechanics test methods.  Direct in situ                    
              observation in the microscope of deformation and fracture ahead                
              of crack tips will be also conducted to gain a physical                        
              understanding of the toughening phenomena.
