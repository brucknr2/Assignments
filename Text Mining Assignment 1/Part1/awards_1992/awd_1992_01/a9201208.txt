Abstract    :
                   The mathematical work supported by this grant lies in the                 
              area of systems of partial differential equations.  More                       
              specifically, boundary value problems in domains with nonsmooth                
              boundaries for elliptic and parabolic systems and higher order                 
              equations will be investigated.  In addition work on                           
              homogenization will be carried out.  One of the particular                     
              problems of interest involves elliptic systems of elastostatics                
              and parabolic systems with boundary data in the Lebesgue spaces.               
              It is not known, in dimension four and greater, what range of                  
              power norms of boundary data will yield solutions.                             
                   Partial differential equations form the backbone of                       
              mathematical modeling in the physical sciences.  Phenomena which               
              involve continuous change such as that seen in motion, materials               
              and energy are known to obey certain general laws which are                    
              expressible in terms of the interactions and relationships                     
              between partial derivatives.  The key role of mathematics is not               
              to state the relationships, but rather, to extract qualitative                 
              and quantitative meaning from them.
