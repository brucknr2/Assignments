Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This award provides support for continued VLBI operations at                   
              Haystack Radio Observatory, for many years one of the foremost                 
              university operated observatories.  It provides for a smooth                   
              transition of VLBI support operations to the VLBA as that instru-              
              ment comes on line, and also provides for some development of                  
              VLBI operations at 3 mm wavelength and further research into high              
              density recording techniques.  These two areas will combine to                 
              permit the highest resolution radio observations possible on the               
              Earth's surface.
