Abstract    :
                   The investigator will study various questions relating to                 
              the existence, stability, and numerical approximation of                       
              solutions of certain models of compressible fluid flow.  Previous              
              work concerning one-dimensional and spherically symmetric flows                
              will be extended to general multidimensional flows and to models               
              for chemically reacting flows and flows involving phase                        
              transitions.  Two long-range goals of the project are: first, to               
              prove the global existence of solutions of the Navier-Stokes                   
              equations for compressible flow with large, discontinuous Cauchy               
              data; second, to understand solutions of these equations in the                
              one-dimensional case, with Riemann initial data, in terms of                   
              solutions of the corresponding Euler equations for inviscid                    
              fluids.                                                                        
                   The mathematical models studied in this project attempt to                
              predict the behavior of fluids which may react chemically so as                
              to ignite, and fluids in which both the liquid or gaseous states               
              may be present simultaneously.  The design and development of                  
              computer methods for numerically solving the model equations is                
              greatly facilitated by a rigorous mathematical understanding of                
              why solutions do exist and in what sense, and how sensitive these              
              solutions are to the initial state of the system.  The primary                 
              goal of this project is to provide this rigorous mathematical                  
              understanding of the mathematical models; a secondary objective                
              is to apply these mathematical results to the design, testing,                 
              and analysis of computer algorithms for generating approximate                 
              solutions.
