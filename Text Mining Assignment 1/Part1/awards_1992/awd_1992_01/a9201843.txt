Abstract    :
              Processing and the mechanical behavior of aluminide                            
              intermetallics and their composites will be studied. Liquid                    
              aluminum will be infiltrated into a perform consisting of the                  
              reinforcing phase, fibers, particulates or powers of high                      
              temperature component of intermetallic Ti, Ni, Fe. The matrix is               
              formed by reaction between the metal power and the aluminum. The               
              research will explore thermodynamics and the reaction kinetics                 
              associated with the synthesis, and the microstructural and                     
              mechanical characterization of resulting materials at elevated                 
              temperatures. The mechanical behavior studies will guide   the                 
              processing efforts.***   //
