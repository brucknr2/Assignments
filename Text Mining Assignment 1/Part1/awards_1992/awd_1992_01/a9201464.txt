Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Laboratory experiments to study convection will be conducted in a              
              differentially heated tank with the objective of better                        
              understanding th heat driven component of the ocean circulation.               
              Quantittive heat flux measurements will be taken under both                    
              rotating and non-rotating conditions.  The central question of this            
              study is to determine how much heat can be transported by                      
              convection in the ocean.
