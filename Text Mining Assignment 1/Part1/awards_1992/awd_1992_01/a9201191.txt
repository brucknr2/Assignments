Abstract    :
              The Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution (WHOI) will design and                
              construct a prototype underwater Acoustic Local Area Network (ALAN)            
              for real-time communication with remote ocean-bottom scientific                
              instruments.  The ALAN will rely on a newly developed underwater               
              acoustic modem that was designed to interface to a wide variety of             
              oceanographic data acquisition systems, ranging from relatively low            
              data-rate thermistor or current meter arrays, to high-rate sensors             
              such as acoustic Doppler current meters and video imaging systems.             
              The ALAN is conceptually similar to land-based cellular telephone              
              networks.  It will enable real-time, interactive, long-term,                   
              offshore monitoring, as well as adaptive sampling and experimental             
              control.  Data throughput of 10 kilobits/sec is anticipated.  The              
              operational range will extend 5-10 kilometers from a central                   
              controller in deep water and up to 100 instruments may be                      
              eventually accommodated.  The initial test deployment in Monterey              
              Canyon will consist of a dozen two-way sensors transmitting to a               
              surface receiver that will have a HF radio link to shore.  The                 
              capability to receive oceanographic data in real time and                      
              communicate with remotely deployed data gathering instruments has              
              long been desired by ocean scientists.  Having this new capability             
              will open new research opportunities as well.  Investigators from              
              Northeastern University and the Monterey Bay Aquarium Research                 
              Institute are collaborating on this project.
