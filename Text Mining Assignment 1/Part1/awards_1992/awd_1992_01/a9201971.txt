Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The objectives of this project are to 1) allow the principal                   
              investigator to learn and become proficient in avian endocrine                 
              research techniques, and 2) apply these techniques to address new              
              questions about the hormonal basis of sexually-selected behaviors              
              in dabbling ducks.  The study  will include four experiments with              
              captive  northern pintails (Anas acuta) and white-cheeked                      
              pintails (A. bahamensis) that are designed to 1) test the                      
              hypothesis that the stimuli associated with pair formation induce              
              hormonal changes that alter male behavior and dominance                        
              relationships, 2) test the effect of experimental manipulations of             
              sexually-selected morphological traits on male behavior, hormonal              
              dynamics and pairing success, 3) examine the hormonal correlates               
              and energetic costs of aggressiveness in polygynous, monogamous,               
              and unpaired males, and 4) compare hormonal responses to a social              
              challenge in northern pintails, a monogamous and non-territorial               
              species , and white-cheeked pintails, which are occasionally                   
              polygynous and highly territorial.  Blood samples taken during                 
              these experiments will be analyzed for 5 hormones using celite                 
              chromatography and radioimmunoassay.  This cross-disciplinary                  
              project will address not only the effect of hormones on behavior               
              but also the feedback of behavior and social interactions on                   
              hormones.  Few studies of mate choice have considered the                      
              implications of endocrine mechanisms in the evolution of                       
              sexually-selected behavior.
