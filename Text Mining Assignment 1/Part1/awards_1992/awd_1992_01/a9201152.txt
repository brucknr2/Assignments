Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Supported by a Small Grant for Exploratory Research, a                         
              numerical investigation will be carried out to evaluated the                   
              utility of wavelet transforms in constructing solutions of                     
              partial differential equations.  As a test problem, an                         
              available two-dimensional but steady state solution of Burgers                 
                                                                                             
              equation will be used as a test bed.  This is a prototype                      
              equation containing many of the characteristics exhibited by                   
              fluid motion, particularly localized regions with strong                       
              gradients.  Wavelet-based numerical solutions will be compared                 
                                                                                             
              to those from conventional techniques for this test case in                    
              which the results are known exactly.                                           
                                                                                             
              Wavelets contain a potential for more efficient and accurate                   
              numerical methods to predict complex fluid motions, applicable                 
                                                                                             
              in diverse areas of engineering.
