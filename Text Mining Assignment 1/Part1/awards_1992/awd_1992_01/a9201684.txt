Abstract    :
              This is a renewal grant jointly funded by the Divisions of                     
              Materials Research and Chemistry.  The theoretical project focuses             
              on the role of disorder on the transport and spin properties of                
              granular metals and conducting polymers.  The work on granular                 
              metals represents a new thrust to this ongoing project.  Impurity              
              band and scaling arguments are proposed to explain the                         
              experimentally observed conductivity in granular metals.  It is                
              shown how the impurity band model for granular metals can be                   
              applied to conducting polymer polyaniline.  In addition, an                    
              interacting electron model is used to explain the magnetic                     
              properties of polyaniline.  Studies will be conducted on                       
              polyacetylene and the role of structural disorder on the insulator-            
              metal transition.  Finally, a study of the crossover from two- to              
              one-dimensional dynamics in the polymer poly-pyrolle perchlorate               
              will be undertaken.                                                            
              %%%                                                                            
              In real materials disorder manifests itself through impurities or              
              the misplacement of atoms or molecules in an otherwise perfect                 
              crystal or chemical structure.  This disorder can have profound                
              effects on the properties of materials.  The understanding of                  
              various types of disorder and its influence on materials represents            
              a major challenge to materials scientists.  The proposed research              
              will study a novel approach to the effects of disorder on two types            
              of systems:  conducting polymers and granular metals.  Both of                 
              these materials have important applications and pose formidable                
              theoretical difficulties.
