Abstract    :
                 This proposal supports a FASEB Summer Research Conference on                
              Calcium and Cell Function to be held July 6-10, 1992 at the Vermont            
              Academy in Saxtons River, VT. This meeting is held once every two              
              or three years, and the participants cover a broad range of biology            
              but share a common interest in calcium as a physiological regulator            
              of many cellular events and processes.                                         
              %%%                                                                            
                 This FASEB conference provides a common platform for scientists             
              working in an unusually-wide variety of fields to share their                  
              results and common interests in calcium. The informal setting and              
              small meeting size will foster scientific interactions between                 
              individuals who, in all likelihood, would not otherwise meet. These            
              interactions are important in developing interdisciplinary research            
              collaborations.
