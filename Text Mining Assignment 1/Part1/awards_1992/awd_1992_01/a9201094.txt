Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Among solid polymer phases, the crystalline inclusion compounds                
              (IC) formed between guest polymer chains and small-molecule host               
              clathrates are unique.  In inclusion compounds guest polymer chains            
              are confined to narrow channels whose walls are formed by the host             
              clathrate matrix, and, as a consequence, are isolated from all                 
              neighboring polymer chains.  The net result is a solid crystalline             
              phase where polymer chains are well-separated from their neighbors.            
              This environment affords the opportunity to study isolated, yet                
              solid, polymer chains as they conform and move in their IC                     
              channels, where they are free from the influences of neighboring               
              polymer chains, which in bulk polymer phases are often highly                  
              cooperative and complex.  Differential thermal analysis, X-ray,                
              Fourier transform infrared, and especially solid-state Nuclear                 
              magnetic resonance observations of polymers in inclusion compounds             
              and their comparison to bulk polymer observations should permit an             
              assessment of the inherent mobilities and conformations of solid               
              polymers and help us to evaluate the effects of constraining                   
              environments (narrow channels) on the same.  Ultimately, an attempt            
              will be made to spin and draw fibers from their inclusion compounds            
              with the hope that the highly extended and isolated polymer chains             
              will produce fibers with improved strengths because of their high              
              extensions and the absence of a chain folded morphology when they              
              are coalesced.
