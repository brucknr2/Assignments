Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This research seeks to prepare novel main-chain and side-chain                 
              liquid crystalline polymers and to incorporate these into diblock              
              copolymers with one conventional coil block.  The synthetic                    
              approach will utilize anionic polymerization techniques so as to               
              produce well-defined model materials.  Liquid crystal block/coil               
              block copolymers and their blends with liquid crystal homopolymer              
              and coil homopolymer as well as with small molecule chromophores               
              and mesogens will be characterized at several length scales using              
              microscopy and scattering techniques.  In particular, their self-              
              assembly into long-range ordered arrays of microdomains will be                
              examined in light of the influence of a main-chain or side-chain               
              liquid crystal block on the nature of the intermaterial dividing               
              surface.  Biased self-assembly due to the presence of an applied               
              field during the microphase separation transition (e.g. electric,              
              magnetic, and hydrodynamic flow fields) will be undertaken so as to            
              produce single-crystal-texture samples for assessment as nonlinear             
              optical materials.                                                             
                                                                                             
              This is a Materials Synthesis and Processing activity jointly                  
              carried out by Christopher K. Ober of Cornell University and                   
              Edwin L. Thomas of Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
