Abstract    :
                   This project will develop global criteria for selecting                   
              clustering procedures using the admissible clustering approach of              
              Fisher and Van Ness with extended definitions of admissibility                 
              conditions.  These admissibility conditions will be applied to                 
              the general infinite parameterized family of clustering                        
              procedures proposed by Lance and Williams; and for each                        
              condition, the corresponding subset of the family's parameter                  
              space yielding admissible algorithms will be determined.                       
                   Clustering is a heavily used tool for partitioning a group                
              of objects into subgroups or species.  It is used by taxonomists,              
              librarians, epidemiologists, bankers, scientists and many others               
              to classify large, complex sets of objects into homogeneous                    
              groups which can be comprehended and handled better.  Numerous                 
              clustering methods have been proposed over the years, with each                
              giving a different clustering; hence, the choice of algorithm is               
              important.  The work here is to codify the various algorithms                  
              according to the properties needed for a specific application.
