Abstract    :
              During the demolition of a 23-year old concrete bridge in Reno, a              
              large number of plant-cast prestressed concrete box girders with               
              a length of 69' were recovered in good condition.  Six of the                  
              girders have been donated to the University of Nevada, Reno (UNR),             
              for research purpose.  These girders provide an excellent                      
              opportunity to study different aspects of the behavior, design,                
              repair, and fatigue life of existing structures.  Research funds               
              have been received from the Department of Energy to test two                   
              girders to determine their actual stiffness and strength and to                
              conduct limited studies on the repair of the girders.                          
                                                                                             
              The primary objective of this proposal is to study four additional             
              girders to determine (1) the actual prestress forces, (2) the                  
              extent of chloride contamination after 23 years of exposure to                 
              deicing salt, (3) the effect of low-level damage on the remaining              
              life, and (4) appropriate repair techniques for girders damaged by             
              collision, and to investigate the fatigue performance of the                   
              repaired girders.
