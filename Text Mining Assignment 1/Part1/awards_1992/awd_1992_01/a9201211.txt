Abstract    :
                   This research on mixture models will develop graphical                    
              diagnostics and formal tests to identify the presence of mixing                
              in generalized linear models and to determine the number of                    
              mixing components for finite mixtures. Methods will also be                    
              developed to incorporate full information for case-control                     
              studies with errors in variables.  The theory will draw on ideas               
              and techniques from nonparametric maximum likelihood, empirical                
              processes, asymptotics, convex geometry, total positivity and                  
              from simulation.                                                               
                   Mixture distributions arise when homogeneous populations are              
              combined in such a way that the origins of individuals are lost.               
              A fundamental problem involves determining whether or not this                 
              combining has occurred and if so, how many different originating               
              populations there were.  This research will investigate graphical              
              techniques and will use mathematical theory to develop practical               
              statistical methods to answer these kinds of questions in many                 
              scientific applications.
