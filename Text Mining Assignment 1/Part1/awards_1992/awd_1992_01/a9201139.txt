Abstract    :
                   A comprehensive computer database to the world's                          
              orthopteroid insect species (cockroaches, grasshoppers, katydids,              
              mantids, cave crickets, etc.) is being developed at the Academy                
              of Natural Sciences. Both living and fossil species will be                    
              included.  Presently the file includes over 21,000 species and                 
              133,000 literature records.  The larger goal, of which this                    
              project is the first part, is to produce a global, taxonomically               
              oriented, multimedia (text, graphics, sound) computer database                 
              which will aid taxonomists and other biologists who wish to know               
              which taxa occur in their regions, how to identify them, and what              
              their ecological role is.  It will be especially valuable to                   
              systematists and managers of insect collections who must struggle              
              with a large and scattered literature.                                         
                   The present project will focus on the North American                      
              grasshoppers.  This group has been the subject of two books                    
              published by the principal investigator, Dr. Daniel Otte - The                 
              North American Grasshoppers.  Volumes I and II were funded by                  
              NSF.  The data assembled in this work will be the foundation for               
              the publishing of volumes 3 and 4 of the series.  Volume 3 will                
              include the economically important subfamily of Melanoplinae                   
              grasshoppers.
