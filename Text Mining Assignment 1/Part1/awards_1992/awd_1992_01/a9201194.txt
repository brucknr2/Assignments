Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              A quantitative study of submarine hydrothermal upflow zones with               
              theoretical reaction path modeling.  The PI will use hydrothermal              
              breccias from Mid Atlantic Ridge, Hess deep and Troodos, in                    
              addition to the results from Hole 504B, to study the relationship              
              between actively venting hot springs and mid ocean ridge and                   
              observed rock alteration styles within upflow zones in modern                  
              oceanic crust ophiolities.
