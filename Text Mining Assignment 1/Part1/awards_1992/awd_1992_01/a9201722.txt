Abstract    :
                     Western knowledge of major Precambrian tectonic and lithologic          
              elements in the basement of the Silurian plate is limited, although            
              considerable data on that geology exists in the (former) USSR.                 
              This action provides support for O.M. Rosen, an expert on the                  
              Siberian plate, to collaborate with workers at the New Mexico                  
              Institute of Mining and Technology in evaluating and analyzing much            
              of the existing information.  Results should provide a compilation             
              of relevant data and several manuscripts that will be of                       
              considerable value to western workers in the Arctic basin including            
              Alaska.
