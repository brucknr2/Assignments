Abstract    :
                9201987  Kwasny      This is the third year funding of a three year continuing
              award to  investigate the following four issues: (1) the processing of  natural
              language with hybrid symbolic/subsymbolic architectures,  (2) the development
              and study of representational schemes that  support both traditional structures
              as well as ambiguity within  those structures, (3) a challenge to the
              determinism hypothesis of  M. Marcus in creating recurrent networks that
              require information  to be extracted from the sentence while processing
              left-to-right,  and (4) the generalization capbilities of various
              deterministic,  connectionist processing systems.  These issues are considered 
              experimentally in a family of demonstration systems under  development.  The
              organization of these demonstration systems is  extended beyond syntactical
              considerations.
