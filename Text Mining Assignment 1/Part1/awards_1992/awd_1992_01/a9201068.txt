Abstract    :
              This SGER project will use electron nuclear double resonance                   
              (ENDOR) and optical techniques to investigate novel magnetic                   
              behavior in one-dimension linear magnetic chains.  A magnetic                  
              resonant ion is created in the chains by doping the chains with                
              diamagnetic species.  This S=1/2 species is delocalized in an                  
              unknown fashion over several metal sites in the chain.  This                   
              delocalization will be probed by the ENDOR technique.  The reslts              
              will be of interest to theoreticians studying low-dimensional                  
              magnetic materials, an area of considerable current interest in                
              condensed matter physics.  Optical techniques will be used to try              
              to disrupt the chains via excitation of a local diamagnetic metal              
              ion configuration.
