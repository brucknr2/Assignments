Abstract    :
              In this RUI project in the Experimental Physical Chemistry                     
              Program of the Chemistry Division, Judge will study the gas                    
              phase absorption spectra of small polyatomics, such as                         
              selenoformaldehyde (CH2Se) and thioformyl fluoride (HFCS), by a                
              combination of classical and modern techniques.  The theory of                 
              a rotational Hamiltonian suited to the specific type of angular                
              momenta experienced by these molecules will be developed. In                   
              particular, a computer program for band-contour analysis using                 
              this Hamiltonian will be augmented for use on a microcomputer.                 
              Such a program will be of use to other spectroscopists in the                  
              field.  Judge and his students will do research at their own                   
              institution during the academic year and will continue to work                 
              in the summers in the labs of Clouthier (University of                         
              Kentucky) and Moule (Brock University, Ontario).                               
              %%%                                                                            
              In this research project Prof. Judge will use a mixture of                     
              conventional spectroscopy and laser methods to derive data                     
              about small molecules which are representative of chemically                   
              important groups related to formaldehyde.  These two                           
              complementary methods yield well-determined spectroscopic                      
              constants for these molecules.  The results of these                           
              spectroscopic analyses will be of interest to both experimental                
              and theoretical chemists as well as to astrophysicists.
