Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Funds are sought for establishment of methods for basic laboratory             
              research on the function of immune systems and the relation of                 
              corticosteroid secretion, to immune function in amphibians.  This              
              research will become the cornerstone of a larger project focussed              
              on both field and laboratory studies on the factors which cause                
              immunosuppression in amphibians.  These studies, in turn,  will be             
              used to assess, as completely as possible, the causes of declines              
              and extinctions in amphibian populations.
