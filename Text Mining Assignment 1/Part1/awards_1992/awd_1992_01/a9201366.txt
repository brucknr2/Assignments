Abstract    :
                   Schwarz proposes to study various problems in quantum field               
              theory.  He will try to construct invariants of contact manifolds              
              and of Legendre knots in three-dimensional contact manifolds by                
              means of topological invariants from quantum field theory.  There              
              will also be a study of semi-infinite cohomology of infinite-                  
              dimensional Lie algebras and the theory of symplectic and contact              
              supermanifolds.  These problems are related to the general theory              
              of quantization of constrained systems and to the superstring                  
              theory.                                                                        
                   Modern physics, quantum mechanics and relativity, is a                    
              product of the twentieth century.  It is founded firmly in the                 
              last century's attempt to address the microstructure of matter                 
              and to come to grips with the concepts of action-at-a distance,                
              electro-magnetism, and heat radiation.  The mathematical                       
              foundations for these developments, collectively called                        
              mathematical physics, ranges from detailed analysis of                         
              Schroedinger operators, which governs the dynamics of particles,               
              to unified field theory, which attempts to unite the four known                
              forces into a single theory.
