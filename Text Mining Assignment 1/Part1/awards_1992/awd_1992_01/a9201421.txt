Abstract    :
              Mycorrhizae are specialized soil fungi that form symbiotic                     
              relationships with the roots of most woody plants.  The fungi are              
              important in the uptake of water and nutrients.  One group of                  
              mycorrhizal fungi are angiocarpic---that is, the fruiting body does            
              not open---and are commonly called truffle-like fungi.  From an                
              ecological perspective, this is an especially important group of               
              organisms throughout the forests of the world, but they a                      
              relatively poorly known.  This is especially true for the forests              
              of the southern hemisphere.  A joint venture that involves                     
              scientists from the forestry programs of C.S.I.R.O. in Australia               
              and American mycologists from Oregon State University will conduct             
              extensive surveys of the Australasian rainforests for truffle-like             
              fungi.  It is certain that the collecting team will discover                   
              numerous new species, genera, and even families.  These forests are            
              being rapidly logged, thereby potentially eliminating many of the              
              endemic mycorrhizae before their ecological and economic utility               
              can be explored.  This research should make those materials                    
              available to the scientific community at large.
