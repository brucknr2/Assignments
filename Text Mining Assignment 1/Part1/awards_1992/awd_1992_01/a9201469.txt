Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This project will construct a high-resolution seawater 87Sr/86Sr               
              reference section from ODP Site 758 in the southern Bay of Bengal.             
              This will significantly improve the temporal resolution and                    
              accuracy of Sr isotopes as a chronostratigraphic tool, increase our            
              understanding of the relationship between oceanic 87Sr/86Sr and the            
              erosion of the Himalayan\Tibetan Plateau region, and better                    
              constrain models of Sr isotope change.
