Abstract    :
              Steiglitz         The research is on the limits of scalable special-purpose 
              architectures for highly parallel computation, especially  computation on
              regular arrays.  Important applications of array-  based computation can be
              found in digital signal processing, and  in many areas of scientific
              computation, including many-body  problems with gravitational or coulombic
              interactions, fluid  dynamics, and wave propagation.  These applications
              require  highly parallel computation either because of the need for real-  time
              operation, or because the total number of operations  required is very large.  
                      The basic problems being addressed are:  1.     The design and
              reliability analysis of large fault-tolerant  arrays, and on-line
              reconfiguration and error-detection  algorithms for these special-purpose
              architectures;  2.     The design and analysis of reliable clocking schemes for
               very large arrays of processors, especially the comparison of  synchronous,
              self-timed, and hybrid clocking;  3.     A study of the general issue of
              cost-effective scaling of  large, special-purpose computer architectures for
              regular  computations; and,  4.     Extension of the work to Hierarchical Data
              Computations,  such as those in the fast monopole and multipole methods for 
              many-body problems, where particles are distributed in space, and  are
              clustered by decomposing space into hierarchical domains.
