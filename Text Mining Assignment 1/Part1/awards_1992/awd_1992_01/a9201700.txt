Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  This one-year project is aimed at comparing longitudinal                  
              differences that exist in the upper atmosphere and ionosphere.                 
              Through use of the large MU (Middle and Upper atmosphere) radar in             
              Japan, the PIs will make comparisons on both an individual-                    
              experiment and climatological-average basis against the                        
              measurements from the Jicamarca, Arecibo, Millstone Hill, and                  
              Sondrestrom radars.  In addition, the MU radar will extend the                 
              ionospheric-tilt studies to the American sector to determine their             
              longitudinal consistency and to confirm hypotheses concerning their            
              relation with global-scale dynamics.  Finally, this research                   
              involves the development of a similar data base for MU radar data              
              at Kyoto University.
