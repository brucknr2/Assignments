Abstract    :
                   This research will study the problem of scheduling a complex              
              job shop system under dynamic arrivals.  This will include product             
              routings that may be reentrant flows.  Machines may incur sequence-            
              dependent setup times.  This is an important, but difficult problem            
              to solve.  The research will provide analytical models as well as              
              heuristics for the simpler versions of the multi-machine problem               
              and, in particular, the bottleneck machines.  These analytical                 
              models will be used to provide a decision support system for shop              
              flow scheduling.                                                               
                   The ultimate goal is to develop efficient  algorithms for the             
              more complicated and realistic problems by adopting the techniques             
              and properties developed for the simpler problem in a more                     
              sophisticated or "smart and lucky" search  algorithm.  This problem            
              is inspired by actual industrial problems and will closely                     
              collaborate with the personnel of a manufacturing job shop to test             
              the algorithms and systems in an industrial setting.
