Abstract    :
              This award is made by the Office of Special Projects in the                    
              Chemistry Division under the Materials Synthesis and Processing                
              Initiative. Structurally homogeneous poly(3-alkylthiophenes)                   
              and poly(3-alkylpyrroles) will be prepared using principles of                 
              self-assembly through inter- and intramolecular hydrogen                       
              bonding. Structural homogeneity will limit defects in the                      
              polymers and enhance electrical conductivity. Oligomers will                   
              also be made in order to provide information about the effect                  
              of molecular structure on electronic and photonic properties                   
              and the likely environments needed for self-assembly in the                    
              related polymers. Molecular mechanics and band structure                       
              calculations will be used as a guide to polymer design.

              Synthesis of well-defined, homogeneously structured conducting                 
              polymers will provide materials with enhanced optical and                      
              electronic properties as well as provide low-defect materials                  
              which would address fundamental transport mechanisms in                        
              conducting polymers.
