Abstract    :
                   Higson will continue his study of several problems related to             
              Baum-Connes conjecture which asserts that for a locally compact                
              group G, the K-theory of the reduced C*-algebra of G is equivariant            
              to the K-theory of its universal proper G-space.  This                         
              investigation will involve the use of an index theorem for proper              
              actions, elliptic operators on buildings, and equivariant E-theory.            
              This is part of the more general K-theory for operator algebras.               
                   The general area of mathematics of this project has its basis             
              in the theory of algebras of Hilbert space operators.  Operators               
              can be thought of as finite or infinite matrices of complex                    
              numbers.  Special types of operators are often put together in an              
              algebra, naturally called an operator algebra.  These seemingly                
              abstract objects have a surprising variety of applications.  For               
              example, they play a key role in knot theory, which in turn is                 
              currently being used to study the structure of DNA.
