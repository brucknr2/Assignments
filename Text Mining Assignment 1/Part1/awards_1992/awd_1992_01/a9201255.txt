Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Laminated sediments collected form the Gulf of California by the PI            
              provide direct evidence of the extent of oxygen minimum zone.                  
              During the last glacial and the Younger Dryas events the                       
              thermocline waters were better ventilated.  PI will use chemical               
              proxies to reconstruct paleochemistry of the Pacific intermediate              
              water from glacial to interglacial time.  AMs dating will provide              
              the necessary chronological control.
