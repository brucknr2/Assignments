Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This workshop will help identify the future needs for controlled               
              environment facilities across a spectrum of disciplines in                     
              biology, ecology and environmental sciences, from physiological                
              ecology, to global climate change to human support systems.  The               
              workshop will involve approximately 40 participants from federal               
              agencies (40%) academia (46%) and the private sector (16%),                    
              cumulatively representing the spectrum of disciplines for which                
              controlled environments are critical research facilities.  A major             
              focus of the workshop will be new areas of investigation in which              
              the plant and ecological sciences play a significant role, i.e.,               
              landscape ecology, and biogeochemistry at atmosphere/geosphere/                
              biosphere interface.
