Abstract    :
              The objective of this project is to                                            
              develop a novel hybrid control                                                 
              system for building structures.                                                
              The system is intended to exploit                                              
              the efficiency and flexibility of                                              
              active control, while maintaining                                              
              the safety and reliability of                                                  
              passive systems.  To achieve this                                              
              objective, a screw-jack or shock-

              incorporates both passive and

              installed in structural braces with                                            
              collocated sensors, and can be                                                 
              easily distributed at multiple

              implement such a system, different                                             
              control algorithms based on robust

              be explored.  Optimization                                                     
              techniques will be used to                                                     
              determine the optimal allocation of                                            
              active/passive control devices and                                             
              sensors, and to maximize both the                                              
              efficiency and safety of the                                                   
              control system.  The hybrid system                                             
              will be finally validated by
