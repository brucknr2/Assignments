Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This award provides continued support for the operation of the                 
              National Drosophila Species Resource Center (NDSRC) at Bowling                 
              Green State University.  The NDSRC collects and maintains a                    
              collection of living culture of 260 Drosophila species.  The center            
              serves a broad area of biological research community by supplying              
              properly identified cultures of Drosophila species, and providing              
              information and technical assistance.  The Center also provides                
              limited research facilities to scientists interested in working                
              with the collection on site.  Current users of the Center include              
              scientists in the areas of developmental biology, cellular and                 
              molecular biology, evolutionary biology and systematics.  In                   
              addition, the Center collection is often used for teaching purposes            
              both at the college undergraduate and high school levels.
