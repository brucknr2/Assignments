Abstract    :
              The Ninth International Workshop on Plant Membrane Biology is being            
              held for the first time in the U.S. on July 19-24, 1992 in                     
              Monterey, California.  This conference/workshop brings together top            
              workers in the field of plant membrane biology to present their                
              latest research, to exchange ideas and techniques and to foster                
              collaborations.  The subjects to be included are the structure,                
              function and regulation of membrane transport proteins, metabolic              
              compartmentation, membrane receptors, light and hormone-mediated               
              signal transduction, membrane protein targetting, and transport                
              through plasmodesmata.  Two instructional workshops, including                 
              manufacturer-sponsored equipment demonstrations, are planned on                
              patch clamping and intracellular calcium measurements.  Nobel                  
              laureate, Bert Sakmann, will present the keynote address.  It is               
              anticipated that the exciting scientific program combined with the             
              scenic environment should provide ideal conditions for the exchange            
              of information and the generation of new ideas which will greatly              
              benefit U.S. scientists and students working in this fundamental               
              area of plant biology.
