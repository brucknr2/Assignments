Abstract    :
                   Automated Guided Vehicles (AGVs) are a highly sophisticated               
              and increasingly popular type of material handling device in                   
              flexible manufacturing systems.  Previous technology dictated                  
              movement of AGVs on a track embedded in the floor or on a painted              
              chemical strip.  The increasing popularity of flexible, free-                  
              ranging AGVs has brought with it a host of research issues related             
              to effective traffic control schemes and conflict-free routing                 
              strategies for different demand assignments.  The focus of this                
              project will be on the development of effective methodologies for              
              real-time control of free-ranging AGVs.                                        
                   This research will extend previous work on conflict-free                  
              routes for AGVs by testing a variety of column-generation schemes              
              and assignment rules in the free-ranging environment.  Alternate               
              objective functions for the static problem and the feasibility of              
              new approaches for real-time routing of AGVs will be tested with               
              the aid of a factorial-designed simulation experiment.  The                    
              experiment will be conducted in both job-shop and cellular                     
              manufacturing environments based on the layout of a very large                 
              manufacturing facility in Western New York.
