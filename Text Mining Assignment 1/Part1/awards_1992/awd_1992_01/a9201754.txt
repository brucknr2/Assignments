Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The University of the Virgin Islands, a historically black                     
              university, requests support from NSF for connection of its                    
              campus network to NSFNET.  The connection would be made from UVI               
              to the organization supporting connectivity to the University of               
              Puerto Rico and from there to SURAnet, the midlevel network                    
              located in this region that will provide operations and network                
              information services.  The award will support a 56 thousand bits               
              per second connection from the University of the Virgin Islands                
              to the University of Puerto Rico.                                              
                                                                                             
              The University will benefit from the greater functionality and                 
              network speed available through this connection to be able to                  
              access supercomputers, libraries, and make file transfers along                
              with being able to implement a more reliable mail system.                      
                                                                                             
              Students, instructors, and faculty researchers will benefit from               
              the link.  This is also a unique opportunity for the school to                 
              explore innovative educational resources.***
