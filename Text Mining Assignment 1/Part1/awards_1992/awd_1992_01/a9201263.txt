Abstract    :
                   The principal investigator proposes to address the problem                
              of pole placement by dynamic compensation for time-invariant                   
              linear control systems.  One goal is to find sufficient and                    
              almost necessary conditions for the pole placemnt map with real                
              dynamic compensators tobe onto, giving exact bounds for the                    
              minimal order real compensator.  Another is to study various                   
              topological questions related to the space of multivariable                    
              linear systems with a fixed McMillan degree leading to a                       
              comparative analysis of physically natural compactifications.                  
                   The pole placement problem is fundamental in linear systems               
              theory.  Linear systems remain important in many applied                       
              situations.
