Abstract    :
                   The purpose of this research project is to formulate in an                
              abstract setting the notions and theory involved in the important              
              area of wavelet bases.  The research intends to derive results                 
              about the existence of wavelets, quality of wavelets, and                      
              summability results for wavelet expansions.  In the abstract                   
              context, one may bring to bear the powerful and modern theories of             
              unitary group representations, Von Neumann algebras, etc.                      
              Preliminary results indicate that this abstraction can lead to                 
              generalizations of and improvements of the classical results.                  
                   Wavelets and multi-resolutions are proving to be suitable                 
              replacements for Fourier analysis in a variety of theoretic and                
              applied problems, especially in signal processing.  This project,              
              in the general area of modern analysis, provides a wavelet                     
              description and theory within the context of unitary operators on              
              the internal affine structure of a separable Hilbert space.
