Abstract    :
                   Kalton, Casazza, and Montgomery-Smith will continue their                 
              research into the structure of Banach and non-locally convex                   
              spaces, and their applications to other areas of analysis, and                 
              applications of probability to Banach spaces.  Among the                       
              questions to be addressed are whether every infinite-dimensional               
              quasi-Banach space has a proper closed infinite-dimensional                    
              subspace, how to calculate the expected value of the norm of the               
              sum of a Rademacher series, and whether the compact approximation              
              property in the dual of a Banach space implies the property for                
              the Banach space.                                                              
                   Banach space theory is that part of mathematics that                      
              attempts to generalize to infinitely many dimensions the                       
              structure of 3-dimensional Euclidean (i.e.ordinary) space.  The                
              axioms for the distance function in a Banach space are more                    
              relaxed than those for Euclidean distance (For example, the                    
              "parallelogram law" is not required to hold.), and as a result,                
              the "geometry" of a Banach space can be quite exotic.  Much of                 
              the research in this area concerns studying the structure theory               
              of Banach spaces.
