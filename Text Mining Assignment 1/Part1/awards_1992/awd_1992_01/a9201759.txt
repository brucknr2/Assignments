Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This award from the U.S.-Argentina Cooperative                                 
              Science Program supports research in materials                                 
              science to be conducted by Dr. Diana Farkas of                                 
              Virginia Polytechnic Institute in collaboration                                
              with Dr. E.J. Savino and Dr. R. Pasianot of the                                
              National Atomic Energy Commission (CNEA) of                                    
              Argentina.  The goal of the project is to carry                                
              out computer simulation of defect structure in                                 
              intermetallic alloys.                                                          
                                                                                             
              The project continues an active collaboration in                               
              the area of theoretical models for radiation -                                 
              enhanced diffusion.  The project focuses on the                                
              development of empirical potentials of many body                               
              type suitable for computer simulation of                                       
              extended defects in ordered alloys.  These                                     
              interatomic potentials will be applied to the                                  
              simulation of point defects in pure metals and                                 
              alloys and extended defects (grain boundaries                                  
              and dislocations) in pure metals and in alloys                                 
              and the interaction of these two types of                                      
              defects. ***//
