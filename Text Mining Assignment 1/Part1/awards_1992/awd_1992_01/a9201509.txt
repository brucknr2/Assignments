Abstract    :
                   The primary objectives of this research are to assess                     
              restriction-site and DNA-sequence variation within the region                  
              common to pericentric inversions of chromosome 6 in the common                 
              deer mouse (Peromyscus maniculatus), and to determine whether                  
              linkage disequilibrium exists between specific DNA haplotypes and              
              each of the three morphs of this chromosome.  These data will be               
              used to evaluate two alternative hypotheses for the origin                     
              (monophyletic or convergent) and maintenance (selection or                     
              recurrent mutation) of the widespread pericentric-inversion                    
              polymorhisms in P. maniculatus and the related deer mouse species              
              P. sitkensis and P. oreas.  The sample will include deer mice                  
              collected from natural populations throughout North America.  The              
              pericentric-inversion system of P. maniculatus represents an                   
              ideal mammalian model to test the general applicability of the                 
              genetic hypotheses and evolutionary principles derived from the                
              paracentric-inversion system of the fruit fly Drosphila                        
              pseudoobscura.
