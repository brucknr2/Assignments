Abstract    :
                   This research focuses on the study of Gelfand pairs arising               
              from actions of compact Lie groups on nilpotent Lie groups.                    
              Specific goals include the classification of such pairs,                       
              development of geometric criteria for Gelfand pairs, and a detailed            
              analysis of the associated spherical functions and differential                
              operators.                                                                     
                   The project is in the general area of modern analysis and                 
              concerns classical questions from noncommutative harmonic analysis             
              in a new setting of Gelfand pairs involving nilpotent groups.  The             
              research draws heavily on the well-known theories of compact and               
              nilpotent Lie groups and provides a nice contrast to the study of              
              Riemannian symmetric spaces.  This research has the opportunity of             
              deepening our understanding of the solvability of differential                 
              operators and the full relationship between the geometry of the                
              orbits of Lie groups and representation theory.
