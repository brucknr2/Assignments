Abstract    :
              This research proposal is an attempt to quantify the effect of the             
              many factors affecting the coefficient of hydraulic conductivity               
              of compacted clays located in an environment subjected to repeated             
              freezing and thawing. Two types of tests will be employed in this              
              study: one-dimensional freezing and three-dimensional freezing. The            
              one-dimensional freezing laboratory test is complicated but better             
              simulate field conditions. The three-dimensional freezing is                   
              simpler and more economical to perform. Therefore, a comparison of             
              the changes in the coefficient of hydraulic conductivity in these              
              tests is an essential step in the development of practical,                    
              economical, and reliable testing procedure. Thin sections of clay              
              used in the test program will be prepared and studied in order to              
              obtain basic knowledge and how freeze/thaw process influence the               
              hydraulic conductivity of compacted clays.
