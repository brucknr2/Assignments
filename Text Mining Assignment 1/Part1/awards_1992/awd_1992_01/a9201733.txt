Abstract    :
              This proposal for a Career                                                     
              Advancement Award outlines a program                                           
              to determine the capacity of                                                   
              obtaining high contrast images in                                              
              reflection from samples of high and                                            
              low atomic number materials when                                               
              illuminated with soft-x-rays of                                                
              wavelengths ranging from 10nm-40nm.                                            
              The demonstration of high contrast                                             
              image capabilities in spite of very                                            
              low reflectivities in this                                                     
              wavelength region, would provide the                                           
              basis for developing an ultra-high-                                            
              resolution (0.03um) soft-x-ray                                                 
              reflection microscope illuminated by                                           
              a laser plasma source.  One
