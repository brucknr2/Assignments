Abstract    :
              Computer-based molecular dynamics simulations will be made of thin             
              boundary lubrication films in an attempt to determine which atomic             
              and molecular scale processes control the tribological performance             
              of these films, in particular, their dynamic, rheological and                  
              thermodynamic properties.  The various materials-dependent                     
              parameters which influence these properties will be identified.                
              Materials parameters of interest include molecular size, structural            
              complexity, bonding characteristics, adhesive energies and solid               
              surface morphology, structure and mechanical properties.
