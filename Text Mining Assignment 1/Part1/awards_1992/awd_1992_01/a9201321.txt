Abstract    :
                   The principal investigator will use methods from Riemann                  
              surface theory to study problems in dynamical systems. In                      
              particular, he will use the theory of quadratic differentials and              
              Teichmuller theory to study the ergodic theory of measured                     
              folliations, interval exchange transformations, and rational                   
              billiards.                                                                     
                   This award will support research in the general area of                   
              dynamical systems. A process which is very simple and easy to                  
              understand locally can become extremely complicated, nonlinear,                
              and difficult to analyze globally. Dynamical systems is the study              
              of this local to global relationship. Many physical systems can                
              best be modeled using this area of mathematics including fluid                 
              flow and turbulence, complex biological systems, mechanical                    
              systems, and chemical reactions.
