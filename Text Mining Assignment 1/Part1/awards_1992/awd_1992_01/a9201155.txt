Abstract    :
              In this project, PI's will deploy an array of current meters near              
              26 degrees North in the Western North Atlantic in order to                     
              directly measure volume and heat transport components of the                   
              thermohaline circulation.  Measurements are directly related to                
              central goals of both the NOAA Atlantic Climate Change Program                 
              (ACCP) and the World Ocean Circulation Experiment (WOCE).                      
              Measurements will extend a time series started in 1988, and will               
              eventually lead to a seven-year time series of volume transport                
              and a six-year series of heat transport.  Focus will be on                     
              investigating climate-related flow transients, and an attempt to               
              resolve the western boundary eddy heat flux component for                      
              correction of planned ACCP and WOCE Atlantic heat flux sections.
