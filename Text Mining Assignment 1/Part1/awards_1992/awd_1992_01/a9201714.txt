Abstract    :
                   The principal investigator will study a number of                         
              mathematical questions relating to nonlinear partial differential              
              equations of evolution type, including some free boundary                      
              problems arising as models for phase transition, and the dynamics              
              of defect solutions of the Landau-Stuart equation.                             
              Generalizations of the Cahn-Hilliard equation and associated                   
              free-boundary value problems will be studied to help understand                
              the phenomena of nucleation, growth, and coarsening.                           
                   The qualitative analysis of such free boundary value                      
              problems will explain the phase separation which occurs in some                
              spatially homogeneous binary alloys.  Such studies are of                      
              significant scientific interest in view of the wide spread                     
              occurrence in real world situations.
