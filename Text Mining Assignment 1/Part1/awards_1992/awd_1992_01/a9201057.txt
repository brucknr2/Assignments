Abstract    :
              The island of Borneo, and especially Kalimantan (Indonesian                    
              Borneo), is a major phytogeographical region of great ecological               
              and biodiversity importance; however, its flora and fauna are                  
              poorly known.  Unfortunately, the region is undergoing rapid                   
              deforestation through commercial logging and swidden agriculture.              
              Thus, unknown species are potentially being lost to science and                
              others are undoubtedly being forced into extinction.  Therefore,               
              there is some considerable urgency to collect the biota of                     
              Kalimantan.  In this study, collection and inventorying of the                 
              plant resources of Kalimantan will commence through six plant-                 
              collecting expeditions especially to Bukit Baka/Bukit Raya Reserve.            
              A specimen database will be developed, and a field guide with keys             
              will be produced.  The project involves extensive interaction with             
              Indonesian institutions including Herbarium Bogoriense.  This                  
              project will form the basis for extended floristic work throughout             
              Kalimantan.
