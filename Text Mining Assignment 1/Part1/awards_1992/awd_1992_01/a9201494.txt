Abstract    :
                   Loeb will continue his work in applying nonstandard models                
              to measure theory, potential theory, and stochastic processes.                 
              This approach uses measure spaces defined on nonstandard point                 
              sets.  These spaces make finite combinatorial methods available                
              in research on infinite probability spaces.  Loeb will combine                 
              this measure theory with the theory of nonstandard hulls.  He                  
              also will continue his work on representing measures and ideal                 
              boundaries in potential theory.                                                
                   This research project is in the area of nonstandard                       
              analysis.  This subject arises from the attempt to develop the                 
              standard topics of analysis, including integration and                         
              differentiation, based on a nonstandard model for the real                     
              numbers.  In the nonstandard model, one has the notion of                      
              "infinitely small" numbers which formalize the intuitive notions               
              behind the concept of limit.  This formal construct often leads                
              to greater combinatorial efficiency.
