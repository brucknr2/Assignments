Abstract    :
              This project will provide support for shipboard scientific                     
              support equipment for the research vessels ATLANTIS II, KNORR and              
              OCEANUS, operated by the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution,                 
              and dedicated to use in support of ocean science research.                     
                                                                                             
              The Shipboard Scientific Support Equipment Program provides funds              
              for ship equipment deemed essential to the proper and safe                     
              conduct of ocean science research. This Program provides support               
              for such items as deck equipment including winch systems for the               
              deployment and retrieval of scientific instruments, navigational               
              equipment such as radars, gyroscopes and earth satellite                       
              receivers to pin point the location of research sites,                         
              communication equipment including radio transceivers and                       
              satellite transceivers for voice and scientific data                           
              communications and other equipment such as motorized workboats                 
              for transporting scientists to and from data retrieval sites.                  
                                                                                             
              The Project Director, Joseph L. Coburn is fully qualified to                   
              direct this project having had considerable experience in                      
              overseeing similar activities.                                                 
                                                                                             
              This project will allow the institution to replace ageing                      
              winches on the KNORR and the OCEANUS, replace a search light on                
              the KNORR, obtain a wire cleaner, radio direction finder, and                  
              computer for the KNORR, an outboard motor for the ATLANTIS II and              
              emergency beacons for the KNORR and ATLANTIS II.
