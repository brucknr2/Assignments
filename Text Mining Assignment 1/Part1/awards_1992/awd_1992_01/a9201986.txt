Abstract    :
              The alignment of liquid crystals by grooved                                    
              substrates is still not well understood at the                                 
              structural molecular level.  This problem is                                   
              important both fundamentally as well as                                        
              technologically.  The increased use of                                         
              microarchitectural devices makes it imperative                                 
              to obtain a better understanding of the                                        
              structure of the LC-substrate interfacial region,                              
              how it is affected by the type of substrate                                    
              preparation and how it affects the bulk of the                                 
              LC film.  We propose to study the evolution                                    
              of structure ordering of smectic LC's deposited                                
              on grated substrates on grated substrates as a                                 
              function of film depth and film thickness.  The                                
              substrates consist of photolithographed gratings                               
              whose period and depth can be changed in a                                     
              controlled manner.  We use the X-ray                                           
              glancing angle technique to characterize                                       
              quantitatively the LC structure evolution.  This                               
              study provide detailed information on the                                      
              behavior of LC films between two disimilar,                                    
              competing interfaces.  It will have considerable                               
              impact on the improved implementation of LC                                    
              films for applications, involving both disimilar                               
              as well as symmetrical surfaces.
