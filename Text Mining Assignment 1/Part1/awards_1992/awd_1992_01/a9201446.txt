Abstract    :
              The objective of this proposal is to develop a                                 
              tractable approach for the analysis of two-                                    
              dimensional quantum which feature sizes <                                      
              1000 A.  We will base our analysis on the                                      
              non-equilibrium Green function formalism                                       
              which can take into account quantum                                            
              interference, dissipation and electron-electron                                
              interactions.  We have made significant                                        
              progress in applying this formalism to realistic                               
              device structures.  Numerical simulation                                       
              programs have been developed for one- and                                      
              two-dimensional quantum devices using a                                        
              simple model for the electron-phonon                                           
              interaction.  The purpose of the proposed                                      
              research is to extend this work to include                                     
              realistic models for the electron-phono and                                    
              electron-electron interactions.  Such                                          
              interactions are expected to play a significant                                
              role in determining the transport properties                                   
              of devices with dimensions in the sub- 1000 A                                  
              range.
