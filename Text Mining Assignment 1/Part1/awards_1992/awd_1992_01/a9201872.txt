Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This is a SBIR Phase II project.  The objective of this research               
              is to develop an imaging system for screening DNA libraries.                   
              Genome research is one of the most active research areas in                    
              biology today, and an improved way to analyze DNA libraries will               
              be useful.  The research plan is to utilize a new nuclear                      
              detector to generate a real time image of the distribution of                  
              radioactivity on the transfer membrane containing DNA samples.                 
              The image will be directly projected onto the primary agar plate.              
              In the Phase I project, a new large area imaging instrument                    
              prototype has been developed using two orthogonal arrays of                    
              scintillating fibers, each coupled to a position-sensitive                     
              photomultiplier tube.  In the Phase II project, research will                  
              focus on improving the performance of the prototype and designing              
              the ways of increasing area.  If successful, the new device will               
              improve the efficiency and precision of the identification and                 
              isolation of genes.
