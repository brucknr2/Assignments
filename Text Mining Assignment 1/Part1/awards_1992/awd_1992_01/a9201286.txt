Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The PI will continue his work on glacial/interglacial changes in               
              water chemistry, productivity and biogenic accumulation rates in               
              eastern tropical Indian Ocean.  Benthic foraminiferal stable                   
              isotope and Cd/Ca data from a depth transect of cores on Exmouth               
              Plateau will provide direct record of chemistry of deep and                    
              intermediate waters.  The record of climate-mediated changes will              
              be extended back to 130K. y.  The project will be carried out in               
              collaboration with Dr. H. Veeh from Flinders University, Australia.
