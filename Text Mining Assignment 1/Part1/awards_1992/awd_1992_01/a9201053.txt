Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  Having prestige has important consequences because                        
              successful claims to esteem often justify access to privileges,                
              yet the concept of prestige has been neglected in empirical                    
              studies of social stratification.  This doctoral dissertation                  
              project will study the processes of classification and aesthetic               
              evaluation among popular music artists in Quebec, empirically                  
              testing the hypothesis that aesthetic judgment and artistic                    
              classifications define boundaries between people and function as               
              mechanisms for permitting and prohibiting access to material and               
              symbolic rewards.  It will analyze how music and musicians are                 
              classified into categories, which criteria are used in doing so,               
              and how prestige and artistic value are allocated among artists.               
              Interviews will be conducted, and multidimensional scaling                     
              techniques will be used to determine to what extent the processes              
              of artistic classification and evaluation reflect the more                     
              general processes of social stratification between people sharing              
              a similar position in society and in the music industry.                       
                                                                                             
                   This project will contribute to the advancement of                        
              sociological knowledge by using techniques developed in studies                
              of occupational prestige to create linkages between two subfields              
              of sociology, the sociology of culture and stratification.  This               
              project also will provide an excellent opportunity for a                       
              promising young scholar to continue to develop independent                     
              research skills.
