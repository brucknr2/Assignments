Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This work is directed toward the design of novel polyamides based              
              on the incorporation of sequential and mimetic residues, similar to            
              those found in proteins.  The research expects to find new                     
              structures which can form biomaterials.  The polymers are mimetic              
              structures related to or different from those present in standard              
              nylons and proteins.  For the characterization of these polymers,              
              Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, circular dichroism (where             
              applicable), solution and solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance,              
              electron microscopy and fiber diffraction techniques will be                   
              employed.  The researchers will also utilize computer simulations              
              to determine the preferred conformations for the polymers and model            
              compounds.  The goal is also to design and synthesize a series of              
              optically active polyoxazolines.  These polymers represent a broad             
              class of novel peptidomimetic structures.  The conformations of                
              these macromolecules and their model compounds will be examined.               
              Both sequence copolymers and the polyoxazolines should have                    
              potential uses as sutures, biomedical devices, and drug-delivery               
              matrices.  Through a study of structure, conformation and                      
              properties, the researchers hope to develop new classes of                     
              peptidomimetic polyamides.  This program has as its objective the              
              preparation and characterization of complex molecular structures               
              that mimic naturally occurring biopolymers.
