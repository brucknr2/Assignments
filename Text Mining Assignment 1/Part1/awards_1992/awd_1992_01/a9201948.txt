Abstract    :
              Sukamto                                                                         
                                                                                            
              This award will provide supplementary support to enable Dr.                    
              Johanes Sukamto of the University of Minnesota to conduct                      
              collaborative research with Dr. Akira Fujishima for 18 months at               
              the Department of Synthetic Chemistry, University of Tokyo.                    
              They will investigate a new photoelectrochemical information                   
              storage system based on a novel photon-mode storage technique.                 
                                                                                             
              The photon-mode technique stores information as a photon-                      
              induced chemical change of the storage media and provides an                   
              alternative to the diffraction limited heat-mode storage                       
              techniques                                                                     
              which rely on the thermal energy of a laser light.  This new                   
              technique uses the photochemical, electrochemical, and                         
              photoelectrochromic properties of thin films such as molybdenum                
              oxide and Langmuir-Blodgett films and allows the possibility of                
              using semiconductor lasers as a photochromic reaction light                    
              source                                                                         
              for a photon-mode memory device.  Dr. Sukamto's theoretical                    
              expertise in photoelectrochemistry will complement Dr.                         
              Fujishima's extensive experience in preparing the molybdenum                   
              oxide and Langmuir-Blodgett thin films and will facilitate an                  
              increase in absorption capabilities for these thin films.
