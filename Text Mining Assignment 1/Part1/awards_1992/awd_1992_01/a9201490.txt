Abstract    :
                   This award supports the research of Professor P. Edelman to               
              work in combinatorics.  He intends to investigate the combinatorics            
              of hyperplane arrangements.  This will include a detailed study of             
              the counterexample to Orlik's conjecture and a continuation of work            
              on h-complexes and h-shellings.                                                
                   The research is in the general area of combinatorics.                     
              Combinatorics attempts to find efficient methods to study how                  
              discrete collections of objects can be organized.  And, so it is               
              extremely important to modern communications, for example the                  
              design of large networks as in telephone systems and the design of             
              algorithms in computer science.
