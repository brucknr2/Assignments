Abstract    :
                   The principal investigator will study models of physical                  
              systems involving a large number of components.  Many of these                 
              components interact and some interactions are stochastic.                      
              Generally there are quantities which are conserved when the                    
              system is viewed globally, and partial differential equations can              
              be used to describe the evolution of these quantities.                         
                   Euler's equations for fluid flow can be derived from                      
              classical laws of motion that conserve mass, momenta, and energy.              
              The principal investigator will study similar types of equations               
              for other physical systems involving a large number of                         
              components.
