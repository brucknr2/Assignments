Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Acoustics plays a crucial role in providing rapid surveys and long-            
              term time series of distributions of marine organisms.  Echo                   
              sounders are typically used  to 1) map the spatial distribution of             
              volume scatterers, 2) interpolate between data collected by nets or            
              pumps, and 3) provide data when net or pumps are not practical for             
              use(such as in logistically dificult regions) and/or cost-                     
              effective.  In order that these acoustic methods be quantitative,              
              accurate scattering models need to be used which relate the echo               
              levels to meaningful biological parameters such as animal size,                
              spatial, and temporal distributions.  The models that are currently            
              available are not at a sufficiently advanced state for reliable                
              use.
