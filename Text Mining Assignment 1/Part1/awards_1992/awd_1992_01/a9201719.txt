Abstract    :
                   This award supports the research of Professor P. Hanlon to                
              work in combinatorics.  He intends to investigate the Macdonald                
              root system conjecture on homology of nilpotent Lie algebras. In               
              addition, he will work generalized library problems.                           
                   The research is in the general area of combinatorics.                     
              Combinatorics attempts to find efficient methods to study how                  
              discrete collections of objects can be organized.  And, so it is               
              extremely important to modern communications, for example the                  
              design of large networks as in telephone systems and the design of             
              algorithms in computer science.
