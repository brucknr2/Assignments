Abstract    :
                This grant provides partial support for travel of 20 scientists              
              to a conference on Great Subduction Zone Earthquakes to be held                
              September 1992 in Fairbanks, Alaska.  The focus of the conference              
              will be on the Shumagin Gap, a zone along the Aleutian Islands                 
              chain in southwest Alaska that has been designated by the                      
              International Association for Seismology and Physics of the                    
              Earth's Interior as a test site for international collaboration                
              on earthquake prediction research.  This research is a component               
              of the National Earthquake Hazard Reduction Program.
