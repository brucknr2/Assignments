Abstract    :
              The primary goal herein is to develop effective tools for experimental         
              work in graph algorithms and theory.  The lack of such software and            
              techniques inhibits the use of efficient but sophisticated graph               
              algorithms and therefore inhibits basic research in graph algorithms           
              and theory.  This includes evaluating current graph packages,                  
              developing software prototypes for new approaches, exploring object-           
              oriented language issues for describing graphs and graph algorithms,           
              and exploring efficiency issues such as on-line algorithms, geometric          
              embeddings, and large data sets.  To date, very little of this basic           
              work for graph software has been done.  A second goal is to develop            
              the analytical techniques necessary for experimental work on graphs.           
              This includes algorithm animation and performance verification.
