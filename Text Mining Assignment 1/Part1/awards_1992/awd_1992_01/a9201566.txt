Abstract    :
              The origin of species is a fundamental problem in biology.  An                 
              enduring controversy concerns the relevant importance of                       
              geographic isolation versus ecological specialization in                       
              promoting speciation.  Sponge-dwelling shrimps (Synalpheus) are                
              highly diverse (100 species) and abundant on coral reefs                       
              worldwide; several characteristics make them ideal candidates for              
              testing whether niche shifts can initiate speciation in sympatric              
              populations.  These include high host specificity, low mobility,               
              and mating in association with the host.  Recent studies have                  
              revealed significant host-associated differentiation in                        
              demography and allozyme frequencies within Synalpheus species, as              
              well as high frequency of undescribed host-specific cryptic                    
              species.  This research will develop 1) a critical analysis of                 
              genetic (allomyze) and host use differentiation among sympatric                
              versus geographically distant demes of the widespread host-                    
              generalist S. brooksi; 2) analyze genetic, behavioral, and                     
              morphometric characteristics of several currently unrecognized                 
              cryptic species of Synalpheus and their host associations; 3)                  
              construct a phylogenetic tree for Caribbean Synalpheus, including              
              newly defined species, onto which host use data and life history               
              characters can be mapped to test rigorously for association                    
              between the sponge-dwelling habit and the radiation of this                    
              group.
