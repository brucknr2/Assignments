Abstract    :
                   The principal investigator will use bifurcation from                      
              infinity techniques to study the asymptotic behavior of                        
              bifurcating branches of solutions of semilinear elliptic                       
              equations to get detailed information about the existence and                  
              multiplicity of solutions for such problems as well as stability               
              information for the associated time-evolution problems.                        
                   Solution structure is strongly dependent on the spatial                   
              dimension and the geometry of the domain.  The stability of                    
              steady state solutions in the case where multiple solutions exist              
              is extemely delicate and important in most physical situations.
