Abstract    :
                   Discrete tandem (DT) production lines, such as transfer lines,            
              form the heart of critical industries such as the automobile                   
              industry, and are highly capital intensive.  This effort aims to               
              enhance the tools available for design optimization of DT lines.               
              The approach involves using simulations of continuous tandem (CT)              
              lines, where the product in the line is continuous fluid.  This has            
              the potential of resulting in more efficient simulations, and much             
              faster optimization schemes--with perhaps two orders of magnitude              
              reduction in CPU times when these two possibilities are combined.              
              The methodology involves:  (i) studying how to create accurate CT              
              representations of DT lines, (ii) devising fast optimization                   
              schemes for these CT simulations, and (iii) translating the results            
              to near-optimal DT line parameters.                                            
                  This research focuses on one configuration of a production                 
              line, it should make a fundamental contribution to the state-of-               
              the-art in manufacturing systems analysis.  It has the potential               
              to provide a richer set of tools for analysis of other types of                
              discrete manufacturing systems.  It is expected that this research             
              will have a short term practical impact and a longer term                      
              theoretical impact.
