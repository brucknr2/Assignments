Abstract    :
                   Three distinct but loosely related research projects are                  
              planned: (a) A study of the Lavrentiev phenomenon for                          
              isoperimetrically constrained problems and its relationship with               
              cavitation effects in nonlinear elasticity, (b) A study of                     
              materials with layered microstructure and materials with negative              
              capillarity, and (c) Stochastic hyperbolic equations and                       
              stochastic control in nematic liquid crystals.  Each part                      
              represents a further development of the mathematical tools                     
              developed in the investigator's previous work, as well as the                  
              introduction of new research topics.                                           
                   The three projects are motivated by problems from continuum               
              mechanics.  The objective is to understand the physics of an                   
              assortment of novel materials and to develop mathematics which                 
              will help to explain, predict, and control their mechanical                    
              behavior.
