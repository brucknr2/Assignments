Abstract    :
              William Gelbart is supported by a grant from the Theoretical                   
              and Computational Chemistry Program to continue his work in                    
              statistical mechanical treatment of amphiphiles.  He is                        
              studying the self-organizing properties and phase                              
              transitions of amphiphiles in water as a function of                           
              concentration.  Three areas of new study are identified: a)                    
              coupling between micellar size/shape and long range order in                   
              concentrated surfactant in water systems; b) structures and                    
              flow properties of solutions of flexible micelles; and c)                      
              statistical mechanics of almost ideal solids under stress.                     
              Gelbart is using a whole host of analytical methodologies                      
              including density functional theory, mean field                                
              approximation, renormalization group approaches, and spin-                     
              vector-like Hamiltonian approaches supplemented in a few                       
              cases with Monte Carlo and molecular dynamics simulations.                     
              %%%                                                                            
              Amphiphiles are long chainlike molecules which have water                      
              soluble polar groups at one end and oily hydrocarbon groups                    
              at the other end.  Amphiphiles find widespread use as                          
              surfactants and detergents.  These molecules tend to                           
              aggregate together in solution and self-organize into layers                   
              or micelles which are enclosed surfaces having the polar                       
              groups on the outside, and the long chain oily portions on                     
              the inside.  Amphiphiles have widespread industrial and                        
              commercial use.  Gelbart's theoretical research will help us                   
              to better understand the physical chemistry of this                            
              important class of chemical compounds, and to design even                      
              better materials of this type.
