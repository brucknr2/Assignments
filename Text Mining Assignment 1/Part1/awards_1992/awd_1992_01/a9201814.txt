Abstract    :
              9201814  Amster  Funds  are  requested for the purchase an extended  mass  range
               triple  quadrupole   mass   spectrometer.  This   instrument   will   used  
              by  investigators  in  the  Departments of Chemistry  and  Biochemistry  to 
              determine the molecular weights of peptides and proteins with sizes  in  the
              range 1,000-100,000 Da, the primary structures of proteins, and the  number and
              location of metal atoms in native and modified proteins. The  requested
              spectrometer will facilitate characterization of transforming  growth  factor 
              E,  pyridoxal-5' phosphate  binding  sites,  biological  electron  transfer 
              pathways,  and  a  range  of  native  and   mutated  metalloenzymes  and 
              metalloproteins. The proposed instrument  will  be  used  for  training and
              research directly related to the  NSF  research  training  group  in  the role
              of transition metals in  biology  at  the  University of Georgia.
