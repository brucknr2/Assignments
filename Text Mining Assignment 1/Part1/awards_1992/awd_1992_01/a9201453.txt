Abstract    :
                   This award supports the research of Professor B. Sturmfels                
              to work on the interplay between combinatorics and algebraic                   
              geometry. He will study fiber polytopes, sparse elimination                    
              theory, intrinsic Grobner basis, the hard Lefschetz theorem,                   
              generalized hypergeometric functions and algorithms in geometric               
              invariant theory.                                                              
                   This research is on the boundary between the fields of                    
              algebraic geometry and combinatorics.  These are among the oldest              
              parts of modern mathematics.  Algebraic Geometry originally                    
              treated figures defined in the plane by the simplest of                        
              equations, namely polynomials.  Combinatorics attempts to find                 
              efficient methods to study how discrete collections of objects                 
              can be organized.  The combination of these two fields has proved              
              itself extremely useful in fields as diverse as physics,                       
              theoretical computer science, cryptography, coding theory and                  
              robotics.
