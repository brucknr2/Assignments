Abstract    :
                   Evolution involves change in the biochemical information                  
              that helps specify the heritable phenotype of an organism.                     
              Mitotically heritable epigenetic information, in the form of                   
              cellular levels of transcription factors, has been proposed to                 
              specify differentiated cell phenotypes in multicellular                        
              organisms.  Similar epigenetic information may help specify                    
              heritable phenotypes of asexually reproductive organisms.                      
              Furthermore, if such epigenetic information is inherited in                    
              meiosis as well as mitosis, then it could also play a role                     
              specifying heritable phenotypes of sexually reproductive                       
              organisms.                                                                     
                   The Principal Investigator will design a DNA construct                    
              consisting of the gene encoding the yeast activator, GAL4, driven              
              off a promoter containing two GAL4 binding sites.  This construct              
              will be introduced into the yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae.  The              
              GAL4 encoded by this construct will have alternative steady state              
              cellular levels, each specifying a phenotypically distinguishable              
              epigenetic state.  The inheritance of the alternative epigenetic               
              states through mitosis and meiosis will then be determined.
