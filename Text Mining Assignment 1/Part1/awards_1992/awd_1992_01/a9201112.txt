Abstract    :
              The focus of this research is the synthesis of cell-surface                    
              glycoconjugates using as building blocks aluminoxy-acetals and                 
              related asymmetric ketals.  The methodology allows for the                     
              preparation of complex carbohydrate sequences and thus, the                    
              ultimate synthesis of inhibitors of the glycoprotein processing                
              enzymes found in the Golgi apparatus.

              With this award, the Synthetic Organic Program is supporting                   
              the research of Dr. Robin L. Polt of the Department of                         
              Chemistry at the University of Arizona.  Professor Polt will                   
              focus his work on the chemical synthesis of novel cell-surface                 
              glycoconjugates, compounds that can be used as biochemical                     
              tools for the study of membranes and Golgi apparatus function.
