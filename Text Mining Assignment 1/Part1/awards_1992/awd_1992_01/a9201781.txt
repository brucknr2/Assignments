Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  This is a doctoral dissertation project to study the                      
              conditions under which organizations make decisions and take                   
              actions.  Organizations sometimes act according to routine rules,              
              sometimes chaotically with no clear predictability.                            
              Organizational theories are sufficiently incomplete to make it                 
              difficult to ascertain the conditions for routine behavior versus              
              crisis management.   The study will attempt to build an                        
              organizational theory.  The theory will be built on a case study               
              of how the Federal Aviation Administration initiates and modifies              
              rules and policies regarding air safety.                                       
                   This study will have both theoretical and practical                       
              implications.  It will provide an important addition to                        
              organizational theory, and new insights into when and why                      
              organizations such as the FAA make decisions according to routine              
              rules and when their decisions and actions are based on reactions              
              to external conditions.
