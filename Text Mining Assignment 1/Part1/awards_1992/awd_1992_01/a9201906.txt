Abstract    :
                   This project is an analytical and experimental effort to                  
              develop the design theory for high performance hydrostatic                     
              bearings, using water as a fluid medium.  Water offers some                    
              important design characteristics, such as very low temperature                 
              rise, for high precision machine tool applications.  It also                   
              overcomes the environmental issues that are traditionally related              
              to oil bearings.  Some of the significant issues that need to be               
              addressed are waters tendency to turbulent flow, because of its low            
              viscosity and its ability to corrode.  Preliminary work has shown              
              that some of these can be overcome using certain types of ceramics             
              and manufacturing the bearing components to very tight tolerances.             
              These issues will be further investigated and formalized in the                
              development of the design methodology.                                         
                   A keen interest in this project has been exhibited by                     
              industry, which should assist in the transfer of these results into            
              practice.  This research is of significant interest to the nation's            
              equipment industry.
