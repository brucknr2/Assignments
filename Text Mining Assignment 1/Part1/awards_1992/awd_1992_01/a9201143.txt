Abstract    :
                   De la Llave will study the long term behavior of                          
              deterministic systems appearing in practical problems.  The                    
              methods proposed for this study are usually based in finding                   
              landmarks that organize the long term behavior.  Since these                   
              landmarks satisfy complicated functional equations, part of this               
              project is devoted to the analytical study of these non-local                  
              functional equations.                                                          
                   This project involves research in ergodic theory.  Ergodic                
              theory in general concerns understanding the average behavior of               
              systems whose dynamics is too complicated or chaotic to be                     
              followed in microscopic detail.  Under the heading "dynamics" can              
              be placed the modern theory of how groups of abstract                          
              transformations act on smooth spaces.  In this way ergodic theory              
              makes contact with geometry in its quest to classify flows on                  
              homogeneous spaces.
