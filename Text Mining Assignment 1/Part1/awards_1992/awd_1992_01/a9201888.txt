Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research  (SBIR) Phase 2 project is             
              in the general area of electrochemistry in the subfield of                     
              inorganic synthesis.  Caustic soda is manufactured in the USA to               
              the extent of about 36,500 tons/day at a market value of about $25             
              million/day, almost exclusively by the electrolysis of brine.                  
              Chlorine is produced simultaneously and has suffered a declining               
              market with no economical routes for its destruction or dumping.               
              Hence, there are real opportunities for alternative manufacturing              
              processes not involving chlorine.  The Phase I research project                
              successfully demonstrated such a process based on the electrolysis             
              of an alternative sodium salt.  The Phase II research effort will              
              identify state-of-the-art cell components and cell design and                  
              modify these accordingly to achieve minimum cell voltage, high                 
              caustic current efficiency, and high caustic concentration, of up              
              to 50% by weight.  Factors contributing to the stability and                   
              performance of the membranes and electrodes will be studied                    
              carefully, and the process will be evaluated under extended                    
              electrolysis conditions.  Statistical design methodology will be               
              followed.  The results of these studies will form the basis of a               
              preliminary engineering design for the overall process and an                  
              economic assessment of capital and operating costs.

              This research has the potential for the development of a new way of            
              making caustic soda without chlorine byproduct.  This is an                    
              excellent example of an environmentally benign synthesis which                 
              could have a significant societal impact.
