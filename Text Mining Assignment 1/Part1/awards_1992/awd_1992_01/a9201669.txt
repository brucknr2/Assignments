Abstract    :
                   The principal investigator will continue his research in                  
              Teichmuller theory and spectral geometry. He will consider three               
              new topics: degeneration of the spectrum, special values of                    
              Rankin-Selberg L-functions, and a mapping class group invariant                
              Poisson kernel for the Teichmuller space.                                      
                   This award will support research in the general area of                   
              differential geometry and global analysis. Differential geometry               
              is the study of the relationship between the geometry of a space               
              and analytic concepts defined on the space. Global analysis is                 
              the study of the overall geometric and topological properties of               
              a space by piecing together local information. Applications of                 
              these areas of mathematics in other sciences include the                       
              structure of complicated molecules, liquid-gas boundaries, and                 
              the large scale structure of the universe.
