Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              A large and unique data set was collected during a series of                   
              experiments conducted in the equatorial Pacific (TROPIC HEAT)                  
              between 1984 and 1987. The measurements consisted of intensive                 
              microstructure profiles, mean current profiles and thermistor chain            
              observations of internal waves. The continuing analysis focusses on            
              the interaction between internal waves and turbulence in the upper             
              equatorial Pacific. It is postulated that mixing by high-frequency             
              internal waves dominates the vertical fluxes in this region.
