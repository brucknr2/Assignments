Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The International Conferences on Fluid Properties and Phase                    
              Equilibria for Chemical Process Design are held every three                    
              years, presently alternating between North America and Europe.                 
              The first five conferences have produced highly desirable                      
              interactions between academic and industrial and government                    
              workers in this vital area for chemical process design and                     
              simulation.  The meetings have also become the most important                  
              gatherings for workers in the area from all over the world;                    
              the Fifth Conference held in 1989 at Banff, Alberta, Canada                    
              attracted more than 200 participants from nearly 30 countries.                 
              Each conference has produced important collections of papers                   
              in their Proceedings.  The Fifth Conference provided over 900                  
              pages of reviews and new research when published in the                        
              international journal Fluid Phase Equilibria.                                  
                                                                                             
              The Sixth Conference is scheduled for 19-24 July 1992 in                       
              Cortina d' Ampezzo, Italy, with substantially the same                         
              successful format as for the most recent Conferences.  Travel                  
              funds are provided to support invited speakers and young                       
              research professors.
