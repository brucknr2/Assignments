Abstract    :
                   The research planned in this project centers on classes of                
              special functions known as orthogonal polynomials.  Orthogonality              
              can only be considered in the presence of a measure; in this work              
              the measures will be concentrated on the real line or on a                     
              circle.  The work focuses on the connection between a measure and              
              the recurrence coefficients of the corresponding orthogonal                    
              polynomials.  Work will also be done investigating the                         
              summability and convergence of orthogonal polynomial expansions.               
              The methods involve minimizing polynomial integrals (the                       
              Christoffel function), asymptotic behavior of difference                       
              equations and eigenvalues of infinite tridiagonal matrices.                    
              These same techniques can be used for studying solutions of the                
              Schrodinger equation in a central field of force and the                       
              Christoffel function is related to statistical prediction theory.              
                   Orthogonal polynomials form a subclass of special functions               
              developed over centuries for the solution or approximate solution              
              of fundamental equations modeling the physical world.  They are                
              generally simple to express, relatively easy to compute and often              
              occur as fundamental solutions of certain differential equations.
