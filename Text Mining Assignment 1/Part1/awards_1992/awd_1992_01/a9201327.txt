Abstract    :
                   The Sustainable Biosphere Initiative (SBI) presents a unique              
              blueprint for the acquisition, dissemination and utilization of                
              the ecological knowledge required to sustain the biosphere.  The               
              SBI has become a very large endeavor, whose success is sought by               
              many agencies, organizations and professional scientific                       
              societies.  The SBI has quickly outgrown the possibility of                    
              implementation by a group of volunteers.  Because of both the                  
              intensity and breadth of interest in the SBI, it now becomes                   
              necessary to place the next steps on a more professional basis.                
              A continuing research Project is proposed with the responsibility              
              of (a) providing a national focal point for the implementation of              
              the SBI; (b) developing symposia, workshops and other means to                 
              more fully define SBI programs, particularly the three research                
              topics and the decision-making topics; (c) maintaining continuous              
              interactions with federal agencies to help provide coordinated                 
              efforts and to meet agency needs as the SBI evolves; (d)                       
              coordinating efforts of the SBI with those of the international                
              community of ecologists through the International Sustainable                  
              Biosphere Initiative; (e) involving other professional                         
              disciplines and societies in the SBI; (f) providing responses to               
              the many requests for information about the SBI; and (g)                       
              reporting the status and progress of the SBI to the broad                      
              scientific community, decision-makers and the educational                      
              community.
