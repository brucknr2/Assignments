Abstract    :
              Fundamental research on the effects of oxygen-related impurities in            
              epitaxial InP and related systems will be conducted.  Primary objectives       
              include understanding the mechanism of deep level impurity                     
              incorporation, the microscopic nature of defect centers and deep levels        
              produced by oxygen-related impurities, and the effects of oxygen-related       
              impurities on electronic properties.  The research emphasizes systematic       
              studies of epitaxial samples containing a controlled deep level                
              concentration.  Targeted deep level concentrations ranging over several        
              orders of magnitude will be incorporated into epitaxial InP and related        
              systems via an MOVPE growth process.  Characterization studies will            
              emphasize high pressure electrical and optical measurements designed to        
              elucidate the relationship of oxygen-related states to band structure,         
              the magnitude of lattice relaxation effects associated with deep level         
              introduction, and the stability of deep level charge states.

              This research focuses on obtaining a fundamental understanding of the          
              electrical and optical properties of InP based materials containing            
              controlled amounts of selected impurities.  The chemical identity and          
              concentration of these impurities impart unique characteristics to InP         
              based materials and will be used to produce materials possessing novel         
              electrical and optical properties.  Technologies based on computers,           
              lasers, imaging, and communications systems will benefit from this             
              research.
