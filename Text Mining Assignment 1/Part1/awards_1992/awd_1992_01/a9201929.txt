Abstract    :
              This research will - by the use of a combined analytical,                      
              computational and experimental (ACE) study - investigate the                   
              initiation of cracks along bimaterial interfaces with                          
              increasing shear. The relative importance of potential                         
              mechanisms in the toughening of a glass/epoxy interface will be                
              examined, employing a single specimen subjected to biaxial                     
              loads. Measurements of applied displacements, corresponding                    
              reactions, and normal crack opening displacements will be made.                
              This work is expected to increase our understanding of the                     
              various mechanisms of toughening that are associated with mixed-               
              mode interfacial crack initiation. Such an understanding could                 
              lead to a rational design or tailoring of interfaces in composite              
              materials, microelectronic devices, coatings and adhesively                    
              bonded joints.***//
