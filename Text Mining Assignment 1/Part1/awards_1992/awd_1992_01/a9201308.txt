Abstract    :
              Network performance under non-uniform workloads and multistage                 
              interconnection network synchronization are very important and                 
              fundamental problems in the organization of parallel computers.                
              This project seeks to improve the communication performance of                 
              shared memory and distributed memory multiprocessors by reducing               
              the adverse impact of non-uniform traffic.  The project seeks to               
              gather real reference traces and examine them by use of a network              
              simulator.
