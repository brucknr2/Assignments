Abstract    :
                   The objective of this project is to study sequencing decisions            
              in state-of-the-art semiconductor manufacturing lines.  The                    
              specific problem being addressed is the "what next" scheduling                 
              decision, the decision as to what should be done next when an                  
              operator has completed a task on a machine tool, and both the tool             
              and operator are ready to perform another task.  The project                   
              involves extensive industrial interaction and focuses on a                     
              production line that manufactures logic and memory chips.                      
                   The research approach consists of periodically comparing the              
              current status of the manufacturing line with current and projected            
              demands for chips of different part numbers.  The set of                       
              constraints under which the manufacturing line is operating is also            
              considered.  A constrained optimization problem will be formulated             
              and solved to determine which operations should be performed during            
              the period in order to place the line in a better position of                  
              meeting the demand.  Priorities for the operations to be performed             
              during the next period are also computed using both dual and primal            
              information from the optimization.
