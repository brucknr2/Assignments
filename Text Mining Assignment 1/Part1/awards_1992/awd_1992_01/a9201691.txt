Abstract    :
              This award will support a sidescan sonar and marine geophysical                
              survey of the western Woodlark Basin to study the structural and               
              volcanic processes, and the dynamics of the upper mantle that are              
              associated with the splitting of continents. The lateral variation             
              from continental rifting to seafloor spreading within the Woodlark             
              Basin makes it an ideal area to investigate  the active process of             
              rifting and spreading center propagation into a continent. Previous            
              detailed seismic reflection work in the area will provide excellent            
              control on the deeper expression of the rifting process and will be            
              integrated with results from the present project. The results of               
              this study will provide necessary site survey data with which to               
              plan  drilling in the Woodlark Basin.
