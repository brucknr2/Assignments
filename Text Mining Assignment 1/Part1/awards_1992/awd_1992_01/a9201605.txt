Abstract    :
              Lee         This research deals with design methodology for  heterogeneous
              implementations of signal processing systems. Some  signal processing
              algorithms consist of highly repetitive,  predictable computations on streams
              of samples with hard real-  time constraints, and are amenable to synchronous
              dataflow  representations and static (compile-time) scheduling. Other 
              algorithms involve some decision making or run-time control flow,  and can be
              accommodated efficiently by a broader dataflow model  that includes run-time
              flow control. When such algorithms are  combined into complete systems, more
              dynamics must be supported,  and discrete-event principles, or real-time
              operating systems  must be included. This research is looking at ways to
              combine  diverse semantics, and is pursuing co-simulation techniques and 
              understanding of the interaction between what formal methods are  available
              within each model of computation. A design framework  (called Ptolemy) that
              supports all these models, individually or  in combination, is being developed
              as a testbed.
