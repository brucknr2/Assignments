Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  Hydroxyl (OH) is an atmospheric free radical of importance in             
              the study of the photochemistry of stratospheric ozone and in the              
              understanding of the roles of anthropogenic nitrogen and chlorine              
              compounds which catalytically destroy ozone.  The stratospheric                
              ozone layer shields the earth's lifeforms from the damaging effects            
              of solar ultraviolet radiation, and accurate predictions regarding             
              its integrity require detailed knowledge of relevant photochemical             
              processes.  Measurements of OH and an understanding of its behavior            
              are essential components of this body of knowledge.  Ongoing                   
              vertical column abundance measurements at Fritz Peak Observatory,              
              Colorado, and the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research             
              Atmospheric Station in Lauder, New Zealand, will be continued                  
              through mid-1995 under this proposal.  These are high resolution               
              spectroscopic measurements of the absorption of sunlight by the OH             
              molecule.  The proposed work will be a continuation of the 15 year             
              observation series in Colorado and of the 3 year series in New                 
              Zealand.  Analytical studies and atmospheric model comparisons will            
              continue in an effort to understand the mechanisms responsible for             
              the observed behaviors of this extensive database.
