Abstract    :
              This project outlined a comprehensive investigation analyzing and              
              relating the microscopic characteristics of AlN, AlN:H, Si3N4, and             
              Si3N4:H thinfilms with their macroscopic properties.  Molecular                
              structure of the films will be determined by complementary                     
              vibrational techniques, FTIR, and Raman spectroscopy. STM, SFM,                
              SEM, EDX,  and XRD are used to characterize the films'                         
              microsctructures. Special emphasis will be placed on determining               
              the role of hydrogen in these films.  The motivation for this work             
              is to improve the understanding of how microscopic details (                   
              molecular structure and microsctructure) control the chemical and              
              mechanical properties of thin films.

              This study investigates the role of hydrogen incorporation on the              
              properties of the thin films.  AlN and Si3N4 films are used for                
              this study.  Molecular structure of the film will be determined,               
              and it will be used to correlated with the microscopic and                     
              macroscopic properties of the film.  This study will provide useful            
              information for the fundamental undrstanding of how microscopic                
              details, such as molecular structure and microsctructure, control              
              the chemical and mechanical properties of thin films.
