Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  The controls on phosphorize formation and mineralization rates            
              will be determined by analysis of the upper several meters of the              
              shelf sediments from cores sampled during ODP leg 112 and several              
              wide-diameter cores to be sampled during two future expeditions.               
              Detailed chronostratigraphic analysis will be obtained by stable               
              isotope analysis of benthonic foraminifera, bulk sediment dating               
              and absolute dating of interdispersed authigenic minerals and shell            
              material. These data will allow the PIs to relate the formation and            
              occurrence of phosphorize to environmental parameters over a time              
              scale of hundreds to tens of thousands of year.
