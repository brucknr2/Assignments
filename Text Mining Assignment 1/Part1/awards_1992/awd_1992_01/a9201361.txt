Abstract    :
                   Complex multiphase chemistry, convection-dominated three-                 
              dimensional fluid flow, and hierarchies of heterogeneities in                  
              porous media are essential features in modeling of modern                      
              enhanced oil recovery and the transport of contaminants.  In                   
              order to simulate fluid flows for these problems, the                          
              investigator  will develop higher-order finite difference                      
              methods, in combination with sophisticated phase behavior                      
              algorithms and adaptive mesh refinement.                                       
                   These techniques will be applied to realistic engineering                 
              problems occurring in current enhanced oil recovery processes and              
              contaminant transport.  Because of the intense computational                   
              effort, all of the algorithms will be designed for efficient                   
              implementation on modern supercomputers, and effective                         
              visualization techniques will be employed.
