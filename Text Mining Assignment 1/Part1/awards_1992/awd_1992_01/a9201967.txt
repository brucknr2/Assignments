Abstract    :
              The Theoretical and Computational Chemistry Program in the                     
              Chemistry Division is supporting research by Prof. David                       
              Hoffman at Iowa State University on a new approach to quantum                  
              dynamics calculations.  This is a collaborative project with                   
              Professor Donald Kouri of the University of Houston whose                      
              effort is also being supported by the Division.  The Feynman                   
              path integral method is used to replace the customary                          
              calculation of matrix products, eigenvalues, and inverses which                
              scale very rapidly with system size.  Gaussian importance                      
              sampling is used to produce a manageable variance in the Monte                 
              Carlo integral.  The goal is to make possible fully quantum                    
              mechanical treatment of scattering systems of a larger size                    
              than previously possible.                                                      
              %%%                                                                            
              Numerically exact quantum mechanical methods for analyzing                     
              chemical reactions have in the past been limited to systems                    
              containing no more than three atoms, at least one of which must                
              be hydrogen.  This project is testing a new computational                      
              technique which offers promise of permitting such calculations                 
              on larger systems and, more generally, can be used in studying                 
              other quantum mechanical collisional processes.
