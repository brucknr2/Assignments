Abstract    :
                   The Flora of China is a Sino-American collaborative project               
              to publish for the first time an English-language flora (in 25                 
              volumes) and to develop a computerized database on the names,                  
              characteristics, and distributions of ca. 30,000 species of                    
              native, naturalized, and economically important vascular plants.               
              The published and computerized accounts will be used worldwide in              
              basic and applied research, horticulture, conservation, and land               
              management.  Manuscripts will be written by Chinese authors in                 
              collaboration with hundreds of foreign botanists, especially from              
              the U.S., Canada, Europe, Japan, and Russia.  All accounts will                
              be reviewed before publication.  The Flora of China is expected                
              to be completed in 15 years.  The U.S. centers are Missouri                    
              Botanical Garden (coordination center), Arnold Arboretum,                      
              California Academy of Sciences, and Smithsonian Institution.                   
              Word-processing/data-entry is done at the Beijing, Guangzhou,                  
              Kunming, and Nanjing centers.  Funding is requested for editorial              
              assistants salaries, Editorial Committee meetings, equipment, and              
              communications.  by the end of this grant period volumes 17 and                
              16 (2329 species) will be published, vol. 15 (1135 species) will               
              be in press, and vols. 18, 24, and 4 (3269 species) will be near               
              completion.  This project marks a new stage in the promotion of                
              botanical interchange between China and the U.S., and                          
              internationally.
