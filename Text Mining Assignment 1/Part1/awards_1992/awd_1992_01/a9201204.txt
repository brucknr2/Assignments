Abstract    :
                    This research focuses on sums of squares formulae type                   
              ?r,s,n! over the integers and the reals.  In the integer case,                 
              the principal investigator will analyze for r = s the shortest                 
              formulae with prescribed z1=x1y1+...+xryr.  He will also                       
              investigate the possibility of constructing new formulae by                    
              modifying known formulae of Hurwitz-Radon type.  In the real                   
              coefficients case, he will try to validate the Adem conjecture by              
              improving current lower bounds.  Related geometric and                         
              topological problems on isoclinic planes in euclidean spaces,                  
              polynomial maps between spheres, and the construction of                       
              nonsingular bilinear maps will also be studied.                                
                   The research supported involves the theory of quadratic                   
              forms.  This, in its simplest form, is the study of polynomial                 
              forms of degree two.  Equivalently, it is an analysis of the                   
              types of inner products that can define the metric geometry of an              
              n-dimensional vector space.  The study of quadratic forms has                  
              deep interrelations with algebraic geometry and algebraic                      
              k-theory.
