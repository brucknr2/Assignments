Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Fundamental research to understand basic electron-phonon interac-              
              tions in C60 molecules(bucky balls) and related materials                      
              including fibers will be conducted.  With respect to C60 the                   
              emphasis is on understanding vibrational modes and electron-                   
              phonon interactions utilizing femtosecond laser pulse-probe and                
              high magnetic field techniques.  The research is of particular                 
              interest  for providing a sounder scientific basis for                         
              understanding the properties of the newly discovered carbon                    
              molecules such as C60, and fiber analogs to C60  which can be                  
              viewed as a single graphene (crystalline graphite) layer rolled                
              up to form a cylinder with each of its ends fitting perfectly to               
              half of a bucky ball.                                                          
              %%%                                                                            
              This research is expected to provide deeper fundamental                        
              understanding of basic properties of new carbon molecules and                  
              fibers which are potential functional electronic/photonic                      
              materials.  From an application point of view, understanding                   
              these properties and their relationship to materials synthesis                 
              and processing is beneficial to advanced technologies related to               
              computing, information processing, and telecommunications.
