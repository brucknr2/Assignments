Abstract    :
                   In recent years, there has been a great deal of interest,                 
              from different points of view, in vector bundles in algebraic                  
              geometry.  Several topics of interest in this field include                    
              moduli of vector bundles on a Riemann surface, moduli of vector                
              bundles on algebraic surfaces, linear series and vector bundles,               
              and vector bundles on projective spaces.                                       
                   This project will support the Workshop on Algebraic Vector                
              Bundles to be held from October 16-19, 1992 at the University of               
              California, Los Angeles.  It is anticipated that researchers will              
              be brought together from several subareas of the field, in the                 
              hope of stimulating interaction between different outlooks.  One               
              of the principal objectives of the workshop will be to expose                  
              newer researchers in algebraic geometry to this area.
