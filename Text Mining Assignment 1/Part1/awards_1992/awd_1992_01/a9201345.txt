Abstract    :
                   This research concerns formal systems that have arisen as                 
              models of biological processes.  The proposed research is                      
              divided in three parts as follows:                                             
                                                                                             
                         Part I.   Splicing Schemes and DNA                                  
                        Part II.   The Dynamics of Piece-wise Endormorphisms                 
                        Part III.  Cellular Automata                                         
                                                                                             
                   Although the underlying formal systems are distinct for                   
              these three Parts, the proposed research is unified by the                     
              fact that the tools to be used throughout are finite state                     
              concepts:  regular languages, finite transducers, and sofic                    
              subshifts.
