Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              A hierarchy of lead-free solders are scientifically designed using             
              thermodynamic calculations of ternary and quaternary phase                     
              diagrams.  Metal elements under consideration include Sn, Sb, Cu,              
              Ag, Bi, Zn, Al, In, and Au.  Solders are processed and analyzed for            
              the phases present.  Wettability, mechanical strength, and fatigue             
              properties are measured.  An iterative approach is taken to assist             
              in the materials selection.  In a later phase promising solders                
              will be investigated with the assistance of electronic device                  
              manufacturers with funding from industry.

              This research is aimed at creating lead-free solders for                       
              industry/environmental improvement.  Processing and reliability of             
              the solders are addressed.
