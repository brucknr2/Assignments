Abstract    :
                   The principal investigator will study a variety of problems               
              raised by current experiments on parametrically driven surface                 
              waves performed in circular and square geometries.  Several                    
              models for physical systems appear to exhibit bifurcations that                
              are non-generic in the context of their natural geometric                      
              symmetry in that the effective symmetry of the bifurcation is                  
              larger than the natural symmetry.  These studies will attempt to               
              explain these apparent hidden symmetries.                                      
                   The analysis of nonlinear hydrodynamic waves is important                 
              because of their wide spread occurrence in nature and because                  
              such analyses can serve as a prototype for other situations.
