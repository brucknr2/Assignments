Abstract    :
                   This work addresses questions of nonclassical behavior of                 
              light in laser and micromasers.                                                
                   Four projects will be examined.  Two concern the dynamics                 
              of two level atoms interacting with the electromagnetic field,                 
              the third deals with nonclassical states and higher order                      
              squeezing and the fourth, the theory of twisted phase                          
              operators.  The long time behavior of the Jaynes-Cummings                      
              model is examined in order to define probability distributions                 
              for atomic quantities and independent and coupled micromasers                  
              studied to explore differences from normal laser systems.
