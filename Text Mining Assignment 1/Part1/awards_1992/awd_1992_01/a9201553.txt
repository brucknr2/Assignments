              The U.S.-Japan Panel on Wind and                                               
              Seismic Effects was established in                                             
              1968.  Annual meetings alternate

              who participate in task committees.                                            
              The task committees focus on                                                   
              specific national issues, e.g.,                                                
              earthquake hazard reduction, buried                                            
              pipelines, transportation and                                                  
              telecommunication systems, and
