Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The primary objectives of this research if to explore the synthesis            
              of new ternary compounds of the type A+?(MX)!, where M is a                    
              transition metal.  The structural relationship of these metal                  
              compounds are similar to some extent to the well-known Zintl                   
              compounds.  A variety of techniques will be used to characterize               
              the compounds.  These include, x-ray diffraction, NMR and Ir                   
              spectroscopies, DTA and TGA analysis, and measurements of                      
              resistivity and magnetic susceptibility.  The proposed research is             
              exciting because it has potentials for developing new high-                    
              temperature superconductors.
