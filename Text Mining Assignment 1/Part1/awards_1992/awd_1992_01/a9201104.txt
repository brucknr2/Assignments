Abstract    :
              Willson         This research is examining several important theoretical  issues
              in nonlinear transistor networks including stability  criteria for and global
              properties of dc operating points,  transient circuit simulation, and stability
              issues related to  analog resistive networks for implementing two-dimensional
              signal  processing algorithms. Additional research is being pursued in  the
              design of FIR filter banks, neural networks, and other  topics. While these
              areas of research are somewhat diverse, they  share the unifying characteristic
              that all projects have as their  primary goal the development of a better and
              more rigorous  understanding of the fundamental nature of the circuits and
              their  properties, and the development of new and useful techniques for  their
              analysis and design.
