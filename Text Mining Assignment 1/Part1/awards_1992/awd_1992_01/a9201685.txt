Abstract    :
              This proposal outlined an interdisciplinary research program to                
              synthesize, with a novel technique, functionally gradient materials            
              (FGM), which are composites with a spatial gradient in composition.            
              The novel process is to use centrifugal force to cause phase                   
              separations of fine particles in molten materials during the                   
              combustion synthesis.  Two classes of experiments are included in              
              the program:  Combustion synthesis with centrifugation, and thermal            
              melting of metals with centrifugation of fine particles into the               
              melt.  Two systems with potential commercial applications are                  
              selected for study:  metal-ceramic and ceramic-ceramic composites              
              with favorable structural properties, and novel electro-optic                  
              materials with compositional gradients chosen on the basis of their            
              utility in gradient-index (GRIN) optical technology and quantum-dot            
              optoelectronic structures.                                                     
              %%%%                                                                           
              This study plans to synthesize functional gradient materials (FGM)             
              using centrifugal force to cause phase separations of fine                     
              particles in molten materials during the combustion synthesis.  Two            
              systems with potential commercial applications are selected for                
              study:  metal-ceramic and ceramic-ceramic composites for structural            
              applications, and electro-optic materials for optical and                      
              optoelectronic applications.  The ability to synthesize FGM will               
              increase the possibilities of commercial applications greatly.
