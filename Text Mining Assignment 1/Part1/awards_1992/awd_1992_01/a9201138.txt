Abstract    :
              Uncertainty pervades real world scenarios, and must therefore be               
              incorporated into every information system that attempts to                    
              provide a complete and accurate model of the real world.  Yet,                 
              present generation information systems have very limited                       
              capabilities in this regard.  On the other hand, many theoretical              
              models have been proposed for the management of uncertainty, but               
              often without thorough understanding of the actual problems faced              
              by researchers, developers, designers and users of information                 
              systems.  This project concentrates on a planning workshop that                
              will bring together leading researchers in the scientific                      
              communities of information systems (e.g., database systems,                    
              information retrieval systems, expert systems, office information              
              systems) and uncertainty modeling (often working within                        
              frameworks such as mathematical logic, probability theory, fuzzy               
              set theory, possibility theory, and evidential models) to study                
              the needs of the information systems community and to tap the                  
              expertise of the uncertainty modeling community, for solutions                 
              that respond to these needs.  This workshop will promote true                  
              dialogue between these two scientific communities; it will                     
              establish the state of the art in this field, and will set the                 
              course for future research.  The project, which is co-sponsored                
              by the European Esprit program, will foster collaborations                     
              between researchers in the United States and Western Europe.
