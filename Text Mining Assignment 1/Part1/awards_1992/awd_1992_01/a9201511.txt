Abstract    :
              During the summer of 1991 southern Minnesota experienced a                     
              sustained period of unusually heavy precipitation and high                     
              relative humidity.  These conditions have seriously affected                   
              several ethnographic collections housed in the Science Museum of               
              Minnesota and permitted the development of mold.  If untreated                 
              this infestation may permanently damage irreplaceable specimens.               
              These materials include several hundred Chiapas Maya and                       
              Guatemalan Maya textiles and other artifacts; hundreds of                      
              Blackfeet and other Northern Plains Native American objects such               
              as beaded leather shirts, leggings, dresses and containers; and                
              200 baskets from the upper Great Lakes region and central                      
              Minnesota dating from the 19th and early 20th centuries.  These                
              collections have been recognized as among the finest and best                  
              documented North American ethnographic collections in the world                
              today.  With NSF support, appropriate conservation measures will               
              be conducted and the materials restored until steps can be taken               
              to permanently remedy the situation.                                           
                                                                                             
              Such collections are of prime importance to anthropologists who                
              study material culture and society- environmental interactions.                
              This grant will help to prevent damage to irreplaceable                        
              materials.
