Abstract    :
                   The OH radical is central to the photochemistry of the                    
              troposphere, and measures of its concentration furnish an extremely            
              sensitive test of our knowledge of the chemistry.  Its detection,              
              however, poses a considerable challenge due to its very low                    
              concentration and possible interfering species.  At this time,                 
              there are several promising candidate methods, some ready for field            
              trials and others not yet developed.  SRI International will                   
              organize and host a workshop in early 1992 to assess current                   
              capabilities, discuss and thereby improve the experimental                     
              approaches, and consider intercomparison test.  HO2 detection is               
              not so difficult as HO detection but is also challenging, and                  
              discussion of its measurement using similar or variant methods will            
              also be included.   The workshop participants will include                     
              atmospheric modelers, researchers involved in field measurement and            
              the associated technique development, and experimentalists in                  
              chemical physics.  A report will be written describing the workshop            
              discussions, conclusions, and recommendations.
