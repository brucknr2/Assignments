Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  Social structure functions to assign people to specific                   
              positions that have differential levels of prestige and power                  
              associated with them.  Persons' perceptions have been studied                  
              in laboratory experiments and found to vary according to the                   
              differential prestige and power they hold as members of positions              
              in specific social structures.  This doctoral dissertation project             
              will study the extent to which perceptions vary with position                  
              within the context of a currently existing and ongoing social                  
              structure.  Data will be collected from individuals at all levels              
              of the organizational structure of the Jobs Opportunities and Basic            
              Skills program in Indiana by conducting personal interviews or by              
              means of mail questionnaires.                                                  
                                                                                             
                   This project will contribute to an important area of interface            
              between social psychology and sociology; namely, perceptions and               
              social position.  It will provide a test of theory on differential             
              perceptions of people in varying positions within the context of               
              real-life social positions of prestige and power.  It also will                
              provide an excellent opportunity for a promising young scholar to              
              continue to develop independent research skills.
