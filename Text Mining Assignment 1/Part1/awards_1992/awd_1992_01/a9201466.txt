Abstract    :
                   The investigator will attack the problem of the isometric                 
              classification of hyperbolic metrics on a given 3-dimensional                  
              manifold, as well as study the topology of limit sets of such                  
              metrics.  These two problems involve understanding the geometry of             
              geometrically infinite ends of hyperbolic 3-manifolds.  The                    
              approach which he plans to use is based on the technique of pleated            
              surfaces in hyperbolic manifolds.  He intends to develop a calculus            
              for pleated surfaces which will enable him to obtain estimates on              
              their geometry and the speed at which they converge to infinity in             
              the 3-manifold.                                                                
                   It is a surprising fact that although we live in a three                  
              dimensional space, a so-called 3-manifold, and so are blessed with             
              a natural intuition about such geometric objects, in the end this              
              does not carry us as far as we might have expected,for questions               
              which have been settled by algebraic calculations for higher                   
              dimensional manifolds still remain baffling in the 3-dimensional               
              case.  The most famous of these is the celebrated conjecture of                
              Poincare from around the turn of the century concerning 3-                     
              dimensional spheres, where precisely the original 3-dimensional                
              case is the only one still open.  The investigator is pursuing a               
              variety of questions about 3-dimensional manifolds with slightly               
              strange notions of distance on them, so-called hyperbolic metrics,             
              but time and time again these questions have been shown to have                
              clear relevance to the case of manifolds with a more familiar                  
              notion of distance.
