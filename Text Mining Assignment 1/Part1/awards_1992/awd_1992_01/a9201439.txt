Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This proposal consists of two parts:  I.  Investigation of phase               
              behavior and molecular order in thermotropic main-chain polymer                
              liquid crystals (PLCs); II,  Synthesis and properties of ionomeric             
              PLCs, a new family of structures with a multiplicity of ionic                  
              charges.  The objectives of this research are to contribute to                 
              understanding of fundamental aspects of molecular and                          
              supramolecular order in PLCs, and directed design of high                      
              performance materials.  Model systems for testing theoretical                  
              predictions are expected, as well as materials with nteresting                 
              mechanical, opto-electronic and transport properties.  In the case             
              of main-chain PLCs, the following investigation of mesophase                   
              behavior will be carried out:  global chain anisotropy,                        
              polymorphism, miscibility, properties of ordered polymer glasses.              
              Both inherently flexible and semiflexible chains are considered.               
              Novel main-chain and side-chain ionomeric PLCs, including                      
              structures derived from substituted ionic polyacetylenes, will be              
              synthesized.  Thermotropic and lyotropic phase behavior will be                
              studied as well as formation of ordered polyelectrolyte complexes.
