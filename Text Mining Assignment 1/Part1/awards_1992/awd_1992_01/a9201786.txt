Abstract    :
                   Mesoscale convective systems (MCS) are collections of deep                
              convective storms that are the parents of most beneficial rain and             
              destructive severe weather in the Spring and Summer in the US.                 
              Improved understanding of these systems and their interactions with            
              other scales of motion is fundamental to improve weather                       
              predictions sought after in the US Weather Research Program.                   
                   Using data previously collected during the Oklahoma-Kansas                
              Preliminary Regional Experiment for STORM Central (O-K PRE-STORM;              
              where STORM stands for STormscale Operational and Research                     
              Meteorology), the Principal Investigator will investigate the                  
              structure and evolution of MCSs and how they affect the larger                 
              scale flow.  The two major objectives are: (1) determine how the               
              circulation structure of the stratiform regions of MCSs develops               
              and how that may affect the structure and longevity of the parent              
              convective system; (2) examine the structure of convective vertical            
              drafts to determine how the area-averaged convective structure                 
              varies in space and time as a possible consequence of mesoscale                
              gradients in the thermodynamic structure of the environment, and               
              interaction between the convective region and internal mesoscale               
              storm-relative flow.
