Abstract    :
                   Microwave and analog engineering research is important to                 
              companies for the development of advanced communication systems of             
              the future.                                                                    
                   Planning activities at Villanova University have developed a              
              base of support for a research program addressing components of                
              advanced communication systems, i.e. specific antenna                          
              configuration, high power and high efficiency devices, and the                 
              development of equipment and techniques to characterize the                    
              microwave properties of materials.  Enough companies are supporting            
              the research program to form a Industry/University                             
              Cooperative Research Center for Microwave/Analog Engineering at                
              Villanova University.                                                          
                   The initial research agenda of Villanova University's                     
              Industry/University Cooperative Research Center for                            
              Microwave/Analog Engineering will address; 1) low profile antennas             
              for communication links, 2) a high power and efficiency amplifier,             
              3) theoretical electromagnetics, and 4) communication satellite                
              architectures.                                                                 
                   There are six company sponsors and five affiliate company                 
              sponsors for the Center committing approximately $300,000.                     
                   The Principal Investigator/Center Director and his colleagues             
              have the knowledge and facilities to run this Center.                          
                   This Industry/University Cooperative Research Center is being             
              coordinated with Dr. Lawrence Goldberg, Program Director, Quantum              
              Electronics Waves and Beams.                                                   
                   The Program Manager recommends Villanova University be awarded            
              $50,000 for the first year of a five-year continuing award.                    
                   Near the end of the first year the Program Director will                  
              review the progress of the Center on a number of criteria,                     
              including the following: 1) the extent to which the university-                
              industry interaction is developing; 2) the extent to which the                 
              support base is developing; 3) the extent to which a robust                    
              research program is developing.  If the review is satisfactory, the            
              Program Director will recommend support for the next period of this            
              continuing award.
