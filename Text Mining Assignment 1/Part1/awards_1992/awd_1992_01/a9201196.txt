Abstract    :
                   This award is to support the Yale Gravitational Physics                   
              Group under the direction of Professor V. Moncrief in their                    
              studies in theoretical general relativity and relativistic                     
              astrophysics.  These studies are directed toward the                           
              application of rigorous mathematical techniques for the                        
              solution of physically significant astrophysical problems.
