Abstract    :
                   This research project will extend the illustrative and                    
              informal models of iteration in engineering design that are                    
              available at present.  Formal methods for guiding the refinement               
              of engineering designs at each iteration will be developed that                
              permit the designer to make better decisions during the design                 
              process.  The set-based representation and manipulation of                     
              uncertainties in engineering design developed previously will be               
              extended to combine the imprecise results from each design step to             
              guide the next step.                                                           
                   Since engineering design informally converges to a solution               
              (in most cases) now, we believe that developing a formalism for                
              guiding the design refinement will also produce an understanding               
              of the conditions under which the iterations are convergent.  This,            
              of course, has profound implications for design, in that very early            
              indications of the possibility of convergence of several different             
              candidate designs may be able to guide the designer to pursue (at              
              least initially) those candidates with the best indications of                 
              convergence.
