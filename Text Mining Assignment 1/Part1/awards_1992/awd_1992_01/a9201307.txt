Abstract    :
              Support is requested for the 36th annual meeting of the Wind River             
              Conference on Genetic Exchange to be held at the Wind River Ranch,             
              Estes Park, Colorado, June 10-14, 1992.  This conference is                    
              primarily concerned with the biology and molecular biology of                  
              genetic exchange systems in a variety of procaryotic and eukaryotic            
              systems, and is the major annually occurring meeting devoted to                
              this subject area internationally.  One significant feature of                 
              these meetings is their accessibility to graduate students and                 
              post-doctoral students, whose travel funds frequently are limited.             
              Specifically to address this problem, we request funds to provide              
              travel support scholarships to facilitate the attendance of                    
              graduate students and post-doctoral students working in various                
              areas of genetic exchange and related subject areas.                           
              %%%                                                                            
              This consistently excellent meeting is the major forum for                     
              discussion of transfer of genetic information between  organisms.
