Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This project consists of a series of laboratory experiments to                 
              study mixing in two-layer exchange flows.  The work includes                   
              quantitative measurements of the hydraulically controlled mean                 
              flow, study of the coherent structures associated with instability             
              and mixing, and the effect of mixing on the mean flow.                         
              Continuously stratified systems will be considered once the two-               
              layer flow experiments are better understood.                                  
                                                                                             
              The study provides an innovative idea in the study of mixing                   
              processes; specifically, the uncoupling mechanism whereby a fluid              
              layer of intermediate density appears between the two                          
              counter-flowing layers and blocks instabilities and mixing.
