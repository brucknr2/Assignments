Abstract    :
                   Solomyak will investigate several topics in operator theory               
              related to ergodic theory.  The first has connections with K-                  
              theory of operator algebras, and centers on the so-called "adic                
              transformations" of Vershik acting on paths of a Bratelli                      
              diagram. These transformations define measure-preserving systems               
              whose ergodic and spectral properties will be studied.  The                    
              proposed approach involves dimension groups, harmonic analysis of              
              measures, and special digit expansions of real numbers.  These                 
              expansions will be considered in the second part of the project.               
              The third topic concerns the problem of determining the invariant              
              subspace structure for Volterra convolution operators.                         
                   This project involves research in ergodic theory.  Ergodic                
              theory in general concerns understanding the average behavior of               
              systems whose dynamics is too complicated or chaotic to be                     
              followed in microscopic detail.  Under the heading "dynamics                   
              can be placed the modern theory of how groups of abstract                      
              transformations act on smooth spaces.  In this way ergodic theory              
              makes contact with geometry in its quest to classify flows on                  
              homogeneous spaces.
