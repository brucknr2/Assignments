Abstract    :
                   This project will support the Conference on Universal                     
              Algebra, Lattice Theory, and Related Areas to be held August 17-               
              21, 1992 at McMaster University in Hamilton, Ontario.  The major               
              purpose of this conference will be to provide an international                 
              forum for a broad exchange of ideas and results in lattice                     
              theory, universal algebra, and related fields.  Support will be                
              provided for the travel of U.S. mathematicians, particularly                   
              recent doctoral recipients and graduate students.
