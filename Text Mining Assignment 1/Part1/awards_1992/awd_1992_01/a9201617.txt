Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  This project is an effort for coordinated study of the coupled            
              upper atmospheric regions, particularly during rapidly varying                 
              geomagnetic storm conditions.  It will be carried out in                       
              collaboration with other workshops organized to focus on specific              
              storm intervals.  The program addresses carrying out multi-station             
              studies of the coupled upper atmospheric regions at different                  
              heights and on a global scale.
