Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  The PIs propose to estimate distributions of electrical                   
              conductivities, neutral wind profiles, and effective electric                  
              fields in the E region through radar experiments.  Secondly, they              
              will infer three energy transfer rates in individual ionospheric               
              flux tubes, i.e. the net Poynting flux entering/leaving the top                
              side of the tube, the Joule heating rate in the flux tube, and the             
              energy carried into the flux tube by auroral particle                          
              precipitation.  Finally, calculations will focus on statistical                
              averages of energy transfer rates and their relative importance                
              with respect to magnetic latitude and local time, season,                      
              geomagnetic activity, solar wind and IMF parameters, and phase of              
              the solar cycle.
