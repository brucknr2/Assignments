Abstract    :
                   A cooperative, international investigation of the lichens                 
              (both micro-and macrolichens) of the greater Sonoran Desert                    
              region (Arizona, southern California, Baja California, Sonora and              
              Northern Sinaloa) is proposed.  The lichen taxa will be revised                
              with near monographic precision for the purpose of writing a                   
              modern Flora (for systematists and other professional botanists -              
               with both English and Spanish editions) and popular manual (for               
              naturalists and conservationists).  Because the Sonoran Desert                 
              includes a significant number of Class I areas (Clean Air Act)                 
              and because lichens are excellent indicators of air pollution, it              
              is anticipated that the flora will have considerable utility to                
              land managers in both the U.S. Forest Service and National Park                
              Services (both U.S. and Mexican).  Liason is established with                  
              four institutions within Mexico and collaboration and with over                
              40 prominent lichen systematists worldwide.  A second purpose of               
              the proposal is to improve the scientific infrastructure of                    
              Mexico so that lichenological studies dealing with lichen                      
              biodiversity and conservation issues (e.g. preservation of                     
              coastal fog zone communities) can be pursued there.
