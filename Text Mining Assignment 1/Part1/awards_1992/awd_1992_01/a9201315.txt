Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The analysis and interpretation of a meridional hydrographic                   
              transect of the Atlantic ocean from Iceland to Georgia Island will             
              be completed.  The study's focusses are (1) the mixing between                 
              Labrador Sea Water and Mediterranean Overflow Water, (2) cross-                
              equatorial deep water exchange in the western basin, (3) the                   
              abyssal circulation of the Brazil and Argentine Basins, (4) a                  
              description of eastward flow of Deep Water from the deep western               
              boundary current eastward near 21 S, and (5) the circulation of                
              Antarctic Intermediate Water in the southwestern South Atlantic.
