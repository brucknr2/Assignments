Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This project is a renewal of prior supported work and it will work             
              on the structural characterization of the complex (polymeric)                  
              natural inducer of larval settlement of  the common Caribbean                  
              coral, Agaricia humilis on the surfaces of the crustose coralline              
              red alga, Hydrolithon boergesenii .  The extent to which larval                
              recognition of this purified natural inducer (when attached to                 
              artificial substrata and deployed in the ocean) contributes to the             
              substratum-specific settlement and metamorphosis of A.humilis                  
              larvae in the natural coral reef environment will be determined.               
              Antibodies to the purified inducer will be used, in high-resolution            
              immunocytochemical studies, to determine whether the inducer is                
              produced by the crustose coralline red algal itself, or by its                 
              associated microbial epibionts.                                                
                                                                                             
              The significance of this project lies in the fact that it will                 
              provide the first complete structural elucidation of a complex,                
              polymeric natural inducer of larval settlement and metamorphosis;              
              the first experimental test of the hypothesis that larval                      
              recognition of a defined natural inducing molecule is responsible,             
              in part, for substratum-specific settlement and larval                         
              metamorphosis in the natural environment; and the first definitive             
              resolution of the source of such a natural inducer.  This study                
              thus will provide the necessary information for later ecological               
              investigations of the hypothesis that changes in larval substratum             
              (chemical) recognition may provide an important axis for the rapid             
              evolution of niche diversification mechanisms and, ultimately,                 
              speciation in coral reef and other benthic marine organisms.
