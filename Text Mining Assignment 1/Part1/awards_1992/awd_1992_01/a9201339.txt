Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  The origin of the Sr-isotope anomaly spotted around 39oN and              
              other shorter wavelength anomalies along the axis of the MAR at                
              46N43N, & 35N is unclear.  The P.I. proposes to analyze glasses                
              that are already in existence for Pb, Nd, & Sr isotopes to                     
              investigate the origin of such geochemical anomalies and generally             
              develop models of mantle heterogeneities and dynamics along MAR and            
              the Azores plume.
