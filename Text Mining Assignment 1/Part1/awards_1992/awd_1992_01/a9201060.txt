Abstract    :
                   Madagascar's land mollusks--remarkable of their taxonomic                 
              breadth, endemism, ancient affinities, often gigantic size, and                
              extensive conchological radiations--are poorly understood in all               
              respects, are inadequately represented in the museums of the                   
              world, and are going extinct at an alarming rate.  An expedition               
              in 1990 revealed that the giant-shelled taxa are overdescribed                 
              and contain polytypic species of astounding morphological                      
              diversity, and that the minute-to-small-sized taxa contain                     
              virtually unexplored major radiations consisting of hundreds to                
              thousands of undescribed species.  Total diversity is predicted                
              to be three to ten times the currently recognized 378 species.                 
              Three expeditions will collect a total of 1,260 sites in regions               
              of known or predicted high diversity, emphasizing uncollected,                 
              unprotected areas undergoing deforestation; year-long sampling at              
              a rain-forest site will provide unprecedented data on seasonal                 
              and micro-geographic patterns of diversity.  The products of this              
              research will be (a) an estimated 9,600 computer-cataloged museum              
              lots of shells and ethanol-preserved specimens, and 2,520 frozen               
              tissue samples, all advertised in a published catalog; (b)                     
              discovery of a predicted 354 new species; and (c) increased                    
              Malagasy awareness of the island's molluscan resources via school              
              lectures, reference collections, and species-identification                    
              catalogs.
