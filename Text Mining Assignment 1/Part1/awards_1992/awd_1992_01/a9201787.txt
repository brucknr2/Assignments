Abstract    :
              The main objective of this project                                             
              is to develop a hybrid control                                                 
              system that requires almost no                                                 
              external energy to control the                                                 
              dynamic response of buildings and                                              
              bridges during earthquakes and/or                                              
              strong wind storms.  This will be                                              
              accomplished through two concurrent                                            
              research activities.  The first is                                             
              directed toward the development of                                             
              an active structural member which                                              
              uses electro-rheological materials                                             
              to control member stiffness and                                                
              damping properties.  The advantage                                             
              of electro-rheological materials is                                            
              that their mechanical properties                                               
              can be changed by over a hundred-                                              
              fold by a low amperage electrical                                              
              field and that these changes can                                               
              occur in milliseconds.  Thus the                                               
              development of active structural                                               
              members whose dynamic properties                                               
              can significantly change almost                                                
              instantaneously on command provides                                            
              a new opportunity for structural                                               
              control.  The second research task                                             
              is to establish a new structural                                               
              control approach which would                                                   
              utilize the unique properties of                                               
              active structural members.  This                                               
              requires a new philosophy for                                                  
              development of control system                                                  
              algorithms, based on directly                                                  
              controlling variable structural                                                
              properties.                                                                    
                                                                                             
              In addition to the research tasks
