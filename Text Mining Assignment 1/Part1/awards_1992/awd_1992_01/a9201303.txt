Abstract    :
              This project will investigate efficient manipulation of finite                 
              groups and estimation of their parameters.  The main focus is                  
              on the design and analysis of efficient algorithms for large                   
              group-theoretic problems.  While interested in improved                        
              asymptotic performance, the project will also emphasize                        
              practicability, demonstrating the relevance of the asymptotic                  
              paradigm to efficient implementation.  Of interest also is the                 
              development of parallel versions of the algorithms.  The                       
              investigation will be extended to matrix groups, the most                      
              frequently occurring representations of finite groups.                         
              Finally, the project will investigate important parameters of                  
              groups, especially the estimation of diameters of various                      
              classes of Cayley graphs.
