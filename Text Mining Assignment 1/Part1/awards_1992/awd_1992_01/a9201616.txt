Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This U.S.-Venezuela award will support a research                              
              collaboration between Professor Richard Hanlin of                              
              the University of Georgia and Professor Omar                                   
              Tortolero of the Universidad Central de Venezuela in                           
              Maracay, Venezuela.  The purpose of the research is                            
              to collect, identify and study Venezuelan                                      
              ascomycetes, with emphasis on plant pathogenic                                 
              species.                                                                       
                                                                                             
              The ascomycetes comprise a major component of the                              
              fungal flora in tropical countries.  Many of them                              
              grow parasitically on plants, and some cause serious                           
              diseases of economically important crops.  Many of                             
              the plant pathogenic ascomycetes in the tropics,                               
              however, are poorly understood biologically, and                               
              even their exact identification is often uncertain.                            
              By combining the expertise of a Venezuelan plant                               
              pathologist acquainted with numerous plant diseases                            
              caused by tropical ascomycetes, with one of the                                
              world's leading ascomycetes researchers, this                                  
              project will increase our understanding of this                                
              important family of fungi.
