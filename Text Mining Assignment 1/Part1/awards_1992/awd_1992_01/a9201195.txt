Abstract    :
                   This project is focused on the development, analysis, and                 
              empirical testing of automated methods for load-balancing parallelized         
              discrete-event simulations that use certain "conservative"                     
              synchronization protocols, on distributed memory parallel                      
              architectures.  Both static and dynamic methods of load balancing will         
              be investigated.  The algorithms will be evaluated by their                    
              performance on large simulation models of queueing networks, Petri             
              nets, and communication networks, executed on an Intel iPSC/2                  
              distributed memory multiprocessor.  Automated techniques for load              
              balancing parallel simulations is essential if parallel simulation is          
              to move out of research labs, and become widely used.
