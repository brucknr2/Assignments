Abstract    :
              This proposal will enable the principal investigator to determine              
              the extent of scientific illustration techniques in                            
              non-illustration courses make a contribution to helping students               
              and researchers develop their  ability to see, record and                      
              understand the world around them.                                              
                                                                                             
              The United States faces a crisis in science and mathematics                    
              education.  Although many causes have been suggested for the                   
              crisis, methods for instruction are high on most lists.  The                   
              University of Arizona has developed highly innovative ways to                  
              helping students visualize scientific and mathematical concepts                
              and to discover things for themselves.  Visual methods are                     
              especially important in the biological sciences where concepts,                
              structures and principles are often inherently visual.  These                  
              changes improve the quality of all instruction and make it more                
              assessable to those at a disadvantage with normal instructional                
              methods.
