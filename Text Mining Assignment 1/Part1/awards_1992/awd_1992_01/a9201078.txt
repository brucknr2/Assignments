Abstract    :
              This research addresses combinatorial and algorithmic problems related         
              to searching and matching of strings.  The main emphasis of the research       
              is on problems that are recurrent in the vast and growing domain of            
              molecular sequence analysis, but the results of this study would benefit       
              various other fields.  Specific issues addressed include :  the                
              efficient (i.e., suitable for very fast serial as well as parallel             
              access) structuring of large sequence databanks; techniques for the            
              identification of various regularities in strings; schemes for the             
              efficient compaction and retrieval of strings and higher structures;           
              variants of string searching and comparison problems; some typical             
              optimization problems in molecular biology; etc.  Such issues are              
              explored within both serial and parallel computational environments,           
              from a deterministic as well as a probabilistic perspective.  It also          
              covers some of the foundational aspects of a larger interdisciplinary          
              effort in cooperation with molecular biologists and biochemists.
