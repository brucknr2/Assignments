Abstract    :
                   Professor Chinburg will work on a theory for a Galois Module              
              Structure for Schemes and the connection between capacity theory               
              and intersection theory on varieties.  In particular, he will                  
              work on generalizing arithmetic intersection theory to limits of               
              arithmetic cycles.                                                             
                   This project falls into the general area of arithmetic                    
              geometry - a subject that blends two of the oldest areas of                    
              mathematics: number theory and geometry.  This combination has                 
              proved extraordinarily fruitful - having recently solved problems              
              that withstood generations.  Among its many consequences are new               
              error correcting codes.  Such codes are essential for both modern              
              computers (hard disks) and compact disks.
