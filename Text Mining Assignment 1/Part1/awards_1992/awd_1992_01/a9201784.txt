Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This project supports the dissertation research of an                          
              anthropology student from UCLA studying how different cultural                 
              backgrounds affect the experiences of abused wives.  Battered                  
              women from three low-income groups: non-Hispanic whites, Mexican-              
              Americans, and Mexican immigrants newly arrived to the US will be              
              interviewed in depth about their experiences. The research will                
              focus on the social, cultural and psychological framework out of               
              which battered women interpret and cope with their violent                     
              relationship.  The student will interview about 75 women, aged                 
              21-35, mothers of at least one child, to elicit their life                     
              stories.  In addition objective scales of acculturation and                    
              conflict will be administered to each woman.                                   
                                                                                             
              This research is important because household violence is a major               
              problem in our society.  Increased understanding of the role of                
              cultural backgrounds in explaining how women cope with violence                
              can help policy makers design programs which are more culturally               
              sensitive and appropriate for diverse sub-cultures in our                      
              society.
