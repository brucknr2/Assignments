Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This study entails processing of Antarctic-Pacific East Pacific                
              Rise (EPR) gravity data with the objective of further developing               
              existing procedures to generate maps of free-air gravity anomalies,            
              Bouguer anomalies and residual gravity anomalies.  A profile of                
              gravity anomalies along the entire Pacific-Antarctic EPR will be               
              generated to investigate their relationship to ridge segmentation              
              processes.  The availability of swath-mapping data will enhance the            
              subsurface interpretation and lead to a better understanding of                
              accretionary plate boundary at the EPR.
