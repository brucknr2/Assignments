Abstract    :
                   The principal investigator will focus on two lines of                     
              research in the theory of functions of several complex variables.              
              He will study the holomorphic symplectic geometry of real                      
              functions and the holomorphic contact geometry of real                         
              submanifolds. He will also study the regularity of a particular                
              solution to the integrability problem for CR structures and for                
              CR vector bundles.                                                             
                   This award will support research in the general area of                   
              differential geometry and global analysis. Differential geometry               
              is the study of the relationship between the geometry of a space               
              and analytic concepts defined on the space. Global analysis is                 
              the study of the overall geometric and topological properties of               
              a space by piecing together local information. Applications of                 
              these areas of mathematics in other sciences include the                       
              structure of complicated molecules, liquid-gas boundaries, and                 
              the large scale structure of the universe.
