Abstract    :
              The Phase I research demonstrated                                              
              the feasibility of formulating a                                               
              novel coating system for wooden                                                
              structures, which through improved                                             
              bonding between the wooden                                                     
              substrate and the coating,                                                     
              effectively protected the wood from                                            
              attack by marine borers, such as                                               
              shipworms.  In addition, it was                                                
              demonstrated that a waterborne                                                 
              system could be formulated which                                               
              also effectively protected the                                                 
              wood, but also contained no                                                    
              hazardous or environmentally                                                   
              suspect components.                                                            
                                                                                             
              The Phase II program continues and                                             
              expands upon this promising early                                              
              work.  This study includes a                                                   
              systematic examination of the many                                             
              formulation variables, and their                                               
              impact upon the coating's physical                                             
              and handling properties,

              series of ocean tests is planned to                                            
              establish the long-term                                                        
              effectiveness of the advanced                                                  
              coatings.
