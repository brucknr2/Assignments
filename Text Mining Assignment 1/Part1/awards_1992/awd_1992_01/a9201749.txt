Abstract    :
                   This research is to explore the feasibility of extracting,                
              amplifying, and sequencing phylogenetically informative nuclear and            
              chloroplast DNA from a broad array of Miocene plant fossils,                   
              amplified and sequenced.  Sequence analysis of chloroplast DNA and             
              nuclear ribosomal DNA has provided the most powerful tool for                  
              rigorous analysis of the phylogeny of green plants.  However, the              
              evidence for inferring phylogenetic pattern is indirect---i.e.,                
              cpDNA and rDNA has been compared only for living members of the                
              Chlorophyta.  If successful, this research would permit the direct             
              incorporation of fossil materials into phylogenetic analyses.  The             
              ability to isolate and analyze DNA from fossil specimens would                 
              therefore provide: (1) a control for phylogenetic inferences based             
              on modern taxa; (2) an opportunity to calibrate the phylogenetic               
              trajectories that have been hypothesized; and (3) the chance that              
              precursors could be fit into the phylogenetic framework.  It is                
              unclear if extraction of fossil DNA can be accomplished routinely,             
              and there is some skepticism based on structural and theoretical               
              grounds that it is not feasible to expect good returns of fossil               
              DNA.  Also, it is unclear whether chloroplast and nuclear DNAs will            
              be equally extractable (there is a possibility that cpDNA is less              
              labile since it is borne within the chlorplast membrane).  This                
              research will focus on a rich and diverse fossil bed in Idaho.
