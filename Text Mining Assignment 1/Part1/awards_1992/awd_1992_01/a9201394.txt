Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The Michigan-Dartmouth-MIT (MDM) Observatory has two fine                      
              telescopes in a good site and some very useful instrumentation.                
              It serves a substantial constituency of astronomers who pursue a               
              wide variety of projects.  However, the observatory computer                   
              systems have become outmoded and overloaded.  New computers are                
              needed to support instrumental developments already in progress.               
              We propose to replace the current observatory computers with                   
              relatively inexpensive RISC-based workstations and modern                      
              peripheral equipment.  This will make it practical to use large-               
              format CCD detectors and to properly reduce and inspect data on                
              site.  The result will be a great enhancement of scientific                    
              productivity of the observatory.
