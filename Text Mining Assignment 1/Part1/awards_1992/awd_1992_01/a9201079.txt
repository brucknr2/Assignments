Abstract    :
              Recently there has been considerable                                           
              interest in rare earth-doped fiber lasers.                                     
              These sources exhibit very low lasing                                          
              thresholds due to strong pump                                                  
              confinement, they are tunable, and they                                        
              have exceptionally large gain bandwidths.                                      
              These properties make them attractive                                          
              sources for optical communications and                                         
              short pulse generation.  Unlike the fiber                                      
              geometry, rare earth-doped waveguide                                           
              lasers in a planar configuration offer the                                     
              potential to integrate multiple components                                     
              on a single glass (or crystal) substrate.                                      
              The excellent transparency of glass, its                                       
              resistance to chemical attack, along with                                      
              its good mechanical properties and low                                         
              cost make it an ideal material for this                                        
              application.  The primary thrust of the                                        
              proposed work is the development of new                                        
              active and passive rare earth-doped,                                           
              channel, waveguide devices on planar                                           
              substrates.  Particular emphasis will be                                       
              placed on the monolithic integration of                                        
              multiple components including lasers,                                          
              directional coupler filters and distributed                                    
              feedback resonators.  Device fabrication                                       
              will proceed predominantly in special melts                                    
              of neodymium and erbium doped,                                                 
              geranium-rich, alkali glass using thermal                                      
              ion exchange techniques.  Single mode                                          
              waveguide lasers operating at 1.06 um, 1.3                                     
              um and 1.5 um, will be demonstrated and                                        
              completely characterized.  Single                                              
              longitudinal mode behavior is to be                                            
              achieved in the lasers using integrated                                        
              distributed feedback structures.                                               
              Fabrication of these structures will proceed                                   
              either by corrugating the waveguide                                            
              surface or by direct photoionization of                                        
              germanium-oxygen defect centers in the                                         
              glass.  Both uniform and tapered DFB                                           
              grating structures are to be considered.                                       
              Second harmonic generation in channel                                          
              waveguides fabricated in rare earth-doped,                                     
              germanium-rich glass will also be                                              
              investigated.
