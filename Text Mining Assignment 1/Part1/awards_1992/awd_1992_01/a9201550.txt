Abstract    :
                   This award in mathematical physics supports the Symposium                 
              on Quantum Nonintegrability; at Drexel University on May 20-                   
              22, 1992.  This meeting will address the current research                      
              efforts which are directed at understanding the issue of                       
              "quantum chaos".
