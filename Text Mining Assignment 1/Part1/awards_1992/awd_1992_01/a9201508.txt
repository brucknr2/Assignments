Abstract    :
                   The principal investigator will study problems in geometric               
              tomography and develop methods to reconstruct the geometry of                  
              convex bodies from projections. In particular he will explore new              
              directions in the algorithmic aspects of reconstructing convex                 
              bodies and polytopes from X-rays, their interactive determination              
              from X-rays, and the classification of intersection bodies. Two                
              undergraduate students will work on parts of the project under                 
              the direction of the principal investigator.                                   
                   This award will support research in the general area of                   
              integral geometry. The geometry of a set may often be analyzed                 
              and described by a decomposition of the set into slices. The                   
              geometry of the slices is often fairly simple and easy to                      
              describe. The main difficulty in the analysis is usually the                   
              reconstruction of the underlying geometric features of the entire              
              set from the geometry of the slices. One well know application of              
              this area of mathematics is the CAT scan.
