Abstract    :
                   This grant covers experimental Elementary Particle                        
              Physics research by a group at Vanderbilt University in                        
              collaboration with other NSF and DOE supported scientists.                     
              The group proposes to study electron-positron interactions                     
              with the CLEO II detector at the Cornell electron-positron                     
              colliding beam accelerator, CESR.  These studies are the most                  
              productive studies in the world on the properties of bottom                    
              quarks.  The properties of the third family of quarks in the                   
              Standard Model of quarks and leptons are almost entirely                       
              determined by the work of the CLEO group at Cornell.
