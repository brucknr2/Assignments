Abstract    :
              Detailed plasma and surface modelling are combined with experiments to         
              understand the fundamental and practical relationships between synthesis       
              and material properties.  Experiments involving 5-15 keV pulsed and/or         
              continuous plasma sheets passing over a substrate at well controlled           
              heights will be conducted to investigate the deposition of Si from             
              silane for improved silicon film formation.  By varying the pulse shape,       
              beam height and process gas, the energy and type of species arriving at        
              the substrate can be controlled, and hence resultant material properties       
              as well.  These studies are combined with modelling of plasma chemistry        
              and surface kinetics to enable the structure and properties of the             
              deposited materials to be predicted from arrival flux characteristics.

              A new approach called pulsed electron beam generated plasma atomic layer       
              deposition(PEGPAD) is proposed as a method to deposit improved                 
              semiconductor films.  This innovative processing technique allows              
              independent control of plasma generated species, their energy, and the         
              substrate temaperature, yet is potentially scalable to industrial              
              production levels.
