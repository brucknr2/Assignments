Abstract    :
                   Professor Tong will work on several problems connected with               
              generalized Riemann-Roch Theorems.  He will study generalizations              
              of the trace algebra of Beilinson and Schectman in higher                      
              dimensions.  The hope is to get a natural connection on                        
              determinant bundles to give Grothendieck Riemann Roch formulas on              
              the level of forms.                                                            
                   This project falls into the general area of arithmetic                    
              geometry - a subject that blends two of the oldest areas of                    
              mathematics:  number theory and geometry.  This combination has                
              proved extraordinarily fruitful - having recently solved problems              
              that withstood generations.  Among its many consequences are new               
              error correcting codes.  Such codes are essential for both modern              
              computers (hard disks) and compact disks.
