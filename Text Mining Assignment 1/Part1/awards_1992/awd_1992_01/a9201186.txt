Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                                                                                             
                                                                                            
              The focus of this research is to quantify transformation rates                 
              between dissolved, colloidal, small particle, and large particle               
              size classes in the surface and deep waters of the Atlantic basin.             
              The approach is to use highly sensitive thermal ionization mass                
              spectrometry and radiochemical procedures to determine 234Th, 228Th,           
              and 230Th in the various size classes.  The colloidal phase,                   
              traditionally collected along with the filtrate, will be sampled               
              in-situ using a cross-flow filtration technique.  Field sampling               
              methods will involve the collection of large particles using                   
              filters (33um) and the direct separation and collection of                     
              colloidal (5,000 NMW-0.2 um) and dissolved (<5,000 NMW) fractions              
              using in-situ cross-flow filtration.  These data will allow for a              
              separation of the processes of sorption onto particle surfaces from            
              the aggregation/disaggregation of colloids and suspended particles.            
              In particular, the mass contribution of colloidal Th and the                   
              potentially important role colloids play as reactive intermediates             
              in oceanic particle cycling and metal scavenging will be assessed.
