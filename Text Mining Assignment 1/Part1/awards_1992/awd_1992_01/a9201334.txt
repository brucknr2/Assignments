Abstract    :
              In this project in the Chemistry Division, Rodriguez will                      
              explore, quantify, and document the effect of a liquid or solid                
              medium on the static and dynamic optical properties of                         
              porphyrins as well as on other comparable large molecules such                 
              as laser dyes.  In this study, the dynamic and static optical                  
              properties of porphyrins in the vapor phase will be compared                   
              with those measured in the condensed phase using static and                    
              time-resolved methods that span the femtosecond- to second-time                
              scales.  Properties of interest include vibrational dynamics,                  
              charge-transfer processes, and van der Waals interactions with                 
              condensed-phase media.

              Much of our present understanding of the behavior of large                     
              molecular systems is based on experimental data acquired on                    
              these molecules in liquid or solid hosts.  However, the                        
              interaction of the molecules with the host can modify their                    
              behavior, and little effort has been devoted to document the                   
              magnitude of these effects.  The results of these                              
              investigations under this Minority Initiation project will                     
              provide a framework for judging the effects of these media on                  
              various systems, including biologically important processes.
