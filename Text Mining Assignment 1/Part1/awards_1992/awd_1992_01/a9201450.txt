Abstract    :
                   CONCUR '92 represents the first conference on concurrency theory          
              to take place in the US since 1984 (an NSF-sponsored workshop at CMU).         
              At this time, there are major research groups in the field at MIT,             
              Stanford, CMU, NC State, Stony Brook, Bell Labs, Boulder, and a number         
              of other places in the US.  CONCUR represents real opportunity since           
              '84 for these researchers to interact with each other, as well as              
              their European Community counterparts, in a conference-like setting.
