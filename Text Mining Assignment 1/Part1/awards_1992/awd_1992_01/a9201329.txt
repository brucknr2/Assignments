Abstract    :
                   This award includes effort in the following areas:  develop               
              and distribute tools for monitoring archive usage, develop                     
              guidelines to determine archive value, experiment with and evaluate            
              several funding models for computer archives, perform several case             
              studies on various archives to evaluate the tools, and provide                 
              archive maintenance support to limit gaps in computer archive                  
              availability during the next several years.  The PI runs wuarchive,            
              the largest archive of its kind on the Internet in the U.S., and               
              possibly in the world.
