Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              A series of turbulence measurements in a stratified estuary, the               
              Hudson River will be conducted over several tidal cycles in order              
              to better understand mixing processes under various shear regimes              
              and test various eddy diffusivity models. The long-term goal of the            
              study is to improve sub-grid scale parameterization of mixing                  
              processes for use in estuarine models.
