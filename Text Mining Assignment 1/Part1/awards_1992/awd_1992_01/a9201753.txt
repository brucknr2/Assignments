Abstract    :
              The general objective of this cooperative project between Donald               
              Anderson, Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, and Qi Yuzao,                  
              Jinan University, Guangzhou, China, is to identify, isolate,                   
              culture, and characterize selected Chinese red tide phytoplankton              
              species with respect to their toxicity, physiology, geographic                 
              distribution, and linkage to specific toxic events.                            
                                                                                             
              During the last decade, the number, magnitude, and economic                    
              impacts of harmful algal blooms (commonly called "red tides")                  
              have increased dramatically in Chinese coastal waters.  A newly                
              established national red tide research program in China includes               
              plans to characterize the taxonomy, physiology, and toxicology of              
              species indigenous to Chinese coastal waters, yet so far only one              
              of the ten important harmful phytoplankton species is in culture,              
              and some of the necessary equipment and expertise for                          
              toxicological and physiological characterization is not available              
              in China.  This project represents one step toward the goal of                 
              establishing a Chinese culture collection of harmful                           
              phytoplankton species and documenting their taxonomy, physiology,              
              toxicology, spatial distribution, and ecology.  This work will                 
              contribute to more general understanding of the field behavior                 
              and characteristics of a toxic bloom species isolated by                       
              geography from populations in US coastal waters.
