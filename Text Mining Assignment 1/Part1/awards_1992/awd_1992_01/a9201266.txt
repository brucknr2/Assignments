Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              We propose to carry out research on the analysis and development               
              of iterative methods that possess good convergence rates when                  
              applied to solving linear and nonlinear systems arising from 3D                
              partial differential equations and that also possess sufficient                
              inherent degree of parallelism for efficient implementation on                 
              advanced parallel computers.  We focus on two representative                   
              types of iterative algorithms, one fine grain (multiscale                      
              preconditioners) and one coarse grain (domain decomposition),                  
              that we feel offer the best hope as a basis for developing                     
              efficient algorithms for their respective architectures.  We                   
              shall pay particular attention to problems with rough and                      
              discontinuous coefficients, convection-diffusion problems and                  
              model Navier-Stokes problems.  In addition, new classes of                     
              parallel machines have also emerged (e.g. CMX and MASPAR), and we              
              propose to investigate the suitability of some of these new                    
              architectures for these two classes of iterative methods.
