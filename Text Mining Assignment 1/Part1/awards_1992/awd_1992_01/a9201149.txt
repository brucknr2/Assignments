Abstract    :
              This research is centered around the preparation of possible                   
              geochemical intermediates which can be used to model the                       
              formation of unusual petroporphyrin structures found in organic                
              sediments.  Compounds including cycloalkanoporphyrins,                         
              deoxophylloerythroetioporphyrin, meso,beta-ethanoporphyrins,                   
              petroporphyrins with fused exocyclic rings and novel porphyrin                 
              dimers are among the proposed synthetic targets.

              With this RUI award, the Synthetic Organic Program is                          
              supporting the research of Dr. Timothy D. Lash of the                          
              Department of Chemistry at Illinois State University.                          
              Professor Lash will focus his research on the synthesis of                     
              porphyrin molecular fossils.  The work will give a better                      
              understanding of the origins of organic sediments and will                     
              involve undergraduates in an exciting area of research.
