Abstract    :
              This award in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic                  
              Program provides continued support for research on catalysis by                
              Dr. George G. Stanley of the Chemistry Department, Louisiana                   
              State University at Baton Rouge.  Bimetallic rhodium complexes                 
              of binucleating linear tetra(tertiaryphosphine) ligands have                   
              been prepared and used as selective catalysts for                              
              hydroformylation reactions.  The catalysts become inactive if                  
              the rhodium centers are separated by long ligand chains,                       
              suggesting that bimetallic cooperativity is an important factor                
              in their activity.  Stanley will study the mechanism and                       
              kinetics of this reaction in order to understand the exact                     
              nature of the bimetallic cooperativity step.  In addition, the                 
              effectiveness of complexes containing other metals and mixed                   
              metals will be tested and the suitability of the system for                    
              asymmetric catalytic reactions will be explored.                               
              &&Hydroformylation is the chemical process of converting alkenes               
              into aldehydes, using hydrogen gas and carbon monoxide as the                  
              other reactants.  The process is widely used commercially to                   
              produce aldehydes as well as alcohols.  Stanley will study the                 
              reactions of new catalyts for this reaction with the goals of                  
              understanding the details of the reaction mechanism and of                     
              testing catalysts which can favor the production of specific                   
              products.
