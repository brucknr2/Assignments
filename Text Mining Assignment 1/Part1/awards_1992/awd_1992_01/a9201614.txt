Abstract    :
              This proposal describes research on confined electron systems using            
              optical measurements in the highest magnetic fields and lowest                 
              temperatures available at the National Magnet Lab.  The research               
              involves a collaboration with crystal growth experts at AT&T Bell              
              Labs.  High-quality GaAs structure with quantum wells and other                
              confined geometries will be investigated in magnetic fields to 69              
              T and temperatures as low as 0.03 K.  Phenomena being investigated             
              include Wigner crystalline solids, the fractional quantum Hall                 
              effect, metal-insulator transition and excitations of coupled                  
              Landau-intersubband levels.  The materials will be investigated                
              with inelastic light scattering and emission spectroscopy.
