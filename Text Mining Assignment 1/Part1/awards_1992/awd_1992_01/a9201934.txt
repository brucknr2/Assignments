Abstract    :
                   During the past two decades there has been considerable                   
              progress in the understanding of the nature of matter through the              
              rigorous mathematical analysis of models which describe different              
              states of matter.  The more notable developments include (1) a                 
              thorough analysis of Thomas-Fermi and related semi-classical                   
              models for atomic and molecular systems, (2) analysis of the                   
              stability of matter, (3) verification of the correct asymptotes                
              of the ground state of energy of atoms up to certain orders, (4)               
              proof of the finiteness of the maximum excess charge of atomic                 
              and molecular systems, estimates on the maximum excess charge,                 
              and proofs of asymptotic neutrality, (5) proofs of the existence               
              of the thermodynamic limit for Coulomb systems, (6) analysis of                
              models in quantum and statistical mechanics, (7) analysis of such              
              quantum phenomena as the quantum Hall effect and the formation of              
              Cooper pairs, and (8) proof of the existence of the hydrodynamic               
              limit of Boltzmann's equation for interacting particle systems.                
                   This project will support a block travel grant to the                     
              Conference on the State of Matter to be held in Copenhagen,                    
              Denmark from July 30 to August 1, 1992.  The conference will                   
              provide an opportunity for newer mathematicians and scientists to              
              learn about developments at the leading edge of this branch of                 
              mathematical physics.
