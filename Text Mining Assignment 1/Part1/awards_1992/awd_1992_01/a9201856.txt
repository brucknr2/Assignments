Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Experimental and theoretical investigations of the                             
              morphological and chemical roughness of interfaces in                          
              multilayer structures, and the evolution of such roughness                     
              with growth and processing conditions, will be conducted.                      
              The evolution of roughness and the effect of interruption                      
              by the introduction of a new layer will be investigated, as                    
              will be the influence of strain on growth front roughness.                     
               X-ray diffraction measurements of buried interfaces will                      
              be compared to STM measurements of growth front correlation                    
              functions.  Statistical mechanical methods will be used to                     
              develop models for growth of multilayer structures in which                    
              kinetic processes change periodically.  Luminescence and                       
              electrical measurements will be correlated where possible.                     
              Studies will initially focus on Si/SiGe and III-V compound                     
              superlattices.                                                                 
              %%%                                                                            
              Interfaces between chemically or structurally                                  
              distinguishable layers are critically important in the                         
              performance of a host of devices, including photonic,                          
              electronic, or optical, whose unique properties depend on                      
              the multiple layering of thin films.  In such structures,                      
              interfaces play a decisive role in performance.  This                          
              research will enhance our understanding of the influence of                    
              interface quality on device performance by providing                           
              quantitative measures of interface morphology and                              
              correlation to electrical and optical properties.  In                          
              particular, the connection with growth and processing                          
              condition will be explored, with the prospect of improved                      
              technology for the fabrication of multilayer-film devices.
