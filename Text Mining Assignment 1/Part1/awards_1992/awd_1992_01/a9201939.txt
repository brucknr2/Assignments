Abstract    :
                   This project extends previous studies in complex function                 
              theory and its generalizations to quasiconformal mappings,                     
              quasiregular mappings and Teichmuller theory.  All are tied by a               
              geometric point of view regarding smooth transformations with                  
              restricted distortion.  The main themes of this particular                     
              activity involve newly developed methods of conformal welding.                 
              One of the primary goals will be to study the uniqueness of                    
              conformally welded domains with complements of zero area.                      
              Preliminary results have also been obtained in the theory of                   
              iteration.  The object of this investigation is to determine the               
              types of Julia sets one can expect to get through welding by                   
              inner functions.  Work will also be done on the question of                    
              whether one can gain insight into the Hilbert transform on                     
              finitely connected domains by maximizing the Fredholm determinant              
              of the transform to obtain an equivalent domain all of whose                   
              boundary components are discs.                                                 
                   Complex function theory encompasses the study of                          
              differentiable functions of a complex variable and related                     
              classes of functions such as harmonic functions and                            
              quasiconformal mappings.  The subject is highly geometric; many                
              of the problems concern the properties of various sets under                   
              transform by functions from one of the above classes.                          
              Applications of the theory to potential theory and fluid dynamics              
              is now standard in engineering circles.
