Abstract    :
                   Support of six Traineeships for five years in the area of                 
              advanced research instrumentation will be supported by this                    
              action.  Cornell has a wide variety of major facilities with                   
              unique equipment for experiments in particle physics and                       
              studies of condensed matter.  Trainees under the program would                 
              use these facilities to learn how to devise new methods for                    
              measuring quantities of fundamental physical interest.  The                    
              technological training would embrace a wide range of modern and                
              complex specialties ranging from accelerator design and very low               
              temperature physics to microfabrication and materials                          
              characterization.  Major emphasis would be placed upon filling                 
              the Traineeships with women and previously underrepresented                    
              minorities.  The Cornell Physics Department has demonstrated its               
              commitment to training women physicists with increasing success                
              over the past 20 years.  The program would permit an enhancement               
              of those efforts.
