Abstract    :
              9256682  Brown       The principal objective of the National Science Foundation 
              Graduate Research Traineeship Program is to increase the numbers  of talented
              U.S. undergraduates enrolling in doctoral programs in  critical and emerging
              areas of science and engineering.   Proposals were solicited from institutions
              whose existing  facilities and staff could accommodate additional graduate 
              students in Ph.D. programs of high quality.  The program is also  intended to
              contribute to strengthening the Nation's human  resource base across all
              geographic sectors and among all under-  represented groups.  Graduate Research
              Traineeship awards are  packages of student support.  The colleges and
              universities that  receive the awards are responsible for the selection of
              trainees,  retention of trainees, and administration of traineeships.      
              Cornell University plans to increase the number of U.S.  Ph.D. statisticians
              through a program of interdisciplinary  training.  The objective of the program
              will be to produce  students with the skills and desire to (a) conduct cross- 
              disciplinary research in science and engineering and (b) foster  undergraduate
              education in the mathematical sciences,  particularly probability and
              statistics, from a broad,  interdisciplinary perspective.  Students will attend
              a weekly  workshop/minicourse program to introduce them to the applications  of
              statistics.  As their study progresses they will attend more  specialized
              courses both in statistics and other fields of  science and proceed to
              interdisciplinary statistical research.
