Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This award to a group of 21 Faculty in the Department of Plant                 
              Biology provides 5 positions graduate students who will                        
              participate in an existing training program in Plant Science.                  
              The program emphasizes fundamental and often unique aspects of                 
              plant processes including photosynthetic mechanisms, aspects of                
              meiosis, and the regulation of growth and development.  Most of                
              these faculty are participants in an existing NSF Biological                   
              Research Center for Plant Development.  The training program also              
              includes a required course in pedagogy and two semesters of                    
              experience as a teaching assistant.  This includes funds to                    
              permit student participation in meetings and summer courses, and               
              purchase of materials and supplies for student research.
