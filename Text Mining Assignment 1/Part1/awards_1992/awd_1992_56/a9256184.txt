Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The Center for American Politics and Public Policy at the                      
              University of California, Los Angeles, has an outstanding group of             
              scholars working on issues of race, ethnicity, and politics.  This             
              Graduate Research Traineeship in Minority Politics will attract and            
              train a cadre of graduate students interested in the study of                  
              minority politics.  The Graduate students will have opportunities              
              to work on projects involving public opinion and political                     
              participation, urban poverty, and the role of minority elected and             
              administative officials in local and national public policy.                   
                                                                                             
              These traineeships will enhance the educational experience of                  
              students by permitting them undistracted time and energy to attend             
              to the rigorous coursework and research required by this                       
              challenging field of inquiry.  The goal of this award is to attract            
              intellectually diverse and multiply-equipped students, with special            
              attention to minorities, women, and others who have been under-                
              represented.
