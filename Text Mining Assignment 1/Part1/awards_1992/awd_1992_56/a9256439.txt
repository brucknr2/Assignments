Abstract    :
              9256439  Kurtz       The principal objective of the National Science Foundation 
              Graduate Research Traineeship Program is to increase the numbers of  talented
              U.S. undergraduates enrolling in doctoral programs in  critical and emerging
              areas of science and engineering.  Proposals  were solicited from institutions
              whose existing facilities and  staff could accommodate additional graduate
              students in Ph.D.  programs of high quality.  The program is also intended to 
              contribute to strengthening the Nation's human resource base across  all
              geographic sectors and among all under-represented groups.   Graduate Research
              Traineeship awards are packages of student  support.  The colleges and
              universities that receive the awards are  responsible for the selection of
              trainees, retention of trainees,  and administration of traineeships.       The
              University of Wisconsin will develop a program to train  doctoral level
              researchers working at the interface between the  mathematical and
              computational sciences and engineering. Trainees  will have the capability to
              employ "state-of-the-art" mathematical  and computational methodology in the
              study of engineering problems  as well as the capability to develop new
              methodology in response to  these problems.  The program will focus on the
              mathematical  modeling process including issues regarding the validity of 
              assumptions and computational feasibility.  Breadth of knowledge  and
              experience will be emphasized through a wide range of course  work and a
              variety of scientific interactions and experiences.
