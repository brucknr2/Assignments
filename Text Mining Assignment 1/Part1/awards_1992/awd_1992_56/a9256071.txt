Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Hampshire College will initiate a six-week, residential,                       
              Young Scholars project in mathematics for 60 students                          
              entering the 11th and 12th grades.                                             
                                                                                             
              This summer program will emphasize research participation in                   
              the study of combinatorics, graph theory, number theory,                       
              geometry, and topology.  Students discover patterns, make                      
              and test conjectures and definitions, create proofs and                        
              counterexamples, build models, write programs, and make oral                   
              and written presentations of their work.  There also will be                   
              opportunities for students to engage in career exploration                     
              activities through interactions with practicing                                
              mathematicians.
