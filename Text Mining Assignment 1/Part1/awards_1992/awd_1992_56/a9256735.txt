Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                                                                                             
                                         ABSTRACT                                            
                                                                                             
                  The objective of the proposed traineeship program is to                   
              develop doctoral professionals in areas that can lead to more                  
              effective utilization of our natural resources and less impact                 
              upon the environment.  The training of doctoral candidates will                
              be accomplished through both research and enhanced educational                 
              activities centered around an integrated approach to addressing                
              the interrelated problems of energy use and its effect upon the                
              environment.  Research will focus on innovative approaches for                 
              improving the energy efficiency and reducing the environmental                 
              impact of systems for a number of applications within the major                
              energy use sectors: energy conversion, industrial, commercial and              
              residential, and transportation.  Specific features of the                     
              training program will include: 1) industrial collaboration and                 
              apprenticeships, 2) establishment of a seminar series for                      
              doctoral students, industrialists, and utility representatives,                
              3) development of a student-driven "research roundtable" for                   
              exchanging ideas between participating students and faculty, and               
              4) the development of new graduate courses.  The research and                  
              educational program will be in interdisciplinary effort involving              
              eight key faculty members from five major areas within the School              
              of Mechanical Engineering and supported by several well-                       
              established state-of-the-art laboratory facilities.  An award of               
              an NSF Graduate Research Traineeship grant would provide support               
              for ten traineeships and would create the basis for a new, long-               
              term program in an area of critical national need.
