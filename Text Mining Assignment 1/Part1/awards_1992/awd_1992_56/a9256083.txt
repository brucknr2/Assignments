Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Gallaudet University will initiate a four-week, residential,                   
              Young Scholars project with an MSTP component in biology,                      
              chemistry, and physics for 30 students entering the 9th,                       
              10th, and 11th grades and 6 high school teachers.                              
                                                                                             
              This summer program for deaf students will emphasize working                   
              in research teams using the theme of the human body.  Each                     
              research team will rotate through each of the three science                    
              areas seeing how each science contributes to the study of                      
              the human body in a different way and at the same time                         
              seeing how the sciences are related to each other.
