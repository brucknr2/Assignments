Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The Research Foundation of the State University of New York                    
              seeks to initiate an eight-week summer commuter Young                          
              Scholars Program for 16 students entering the twelfth grade.                   
              The Program will provide hands-on research experiences in                      
              the biological sciences during the summer with follow-up                       
              activities during the academic year. Students will work                        
              closely with a faculty mentor on a research project and                        
              share the experiences in weekly seminars and with their                        
              classmates during the academic year. Seminars on careers and                   
              field trips to industrial setting are integral parts of the                    
              program.
