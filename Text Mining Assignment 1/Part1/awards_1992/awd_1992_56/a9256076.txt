Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The University of Rochester will initiate an eight-week,                       
              commuter, Young Scholars project in physics, engineering,                      
              and chemistry for 10 students entering the 12th grade.                         
                                                                                             
              This summer program will emphasize research participation in                   
              the study of the physics of direct-drive laser fusion, high-                   
              energy-density physics, optoelectronics, high-power lasers,                    
              plasma physics and nuclear fusion technology.  Students will                   
              conduct investigations and design experiments.  There also                     
              will be opportunities for students to engage in career                         
              exploration activities through interactions with scientists.
