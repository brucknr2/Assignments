Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The Jackson Laboratory will initiate a ten-week,                               
              residential, Young Scholars project in mammalian genetics                      
              for 10 students entering the 12th grade.                                       
                                                                                             
              This summer year program will emphasize the study of                           
              experimental genetics using the mouse.  The creation of                        
              inbred, genetically defined strains of mice, development of                    
              methods for culture of mammalian cells, and techniques for                     
              manipulating genetic material have made the mouse the                          
              preferred mammalian model for this research.  Students                         
              design and carry out an original piece of research,                            
              interpret their data, write and present oral reports on                        
              their findings, and learn complex laboratory procedures.
