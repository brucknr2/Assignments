Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This Graduate Research Traineeship will enable Lehigh                          
              University to support five trainees, initiate two new                          
              research thrusts and expand two existing research areas in                     
              the Materials Science and Engineering (MS&E) Department at                     
              Lehigh University.  Since 1988, four new and experienced                       
              faculty have entered the Department and two more start in                      
              1992-93, thus creating the need for more graduates.  The                       
              trainees will work in materials processing,                                    
              characterization, and theory/modeling, which comprise a 1992                   
              Presidential Initiative:-the Advanced Materials and                            
              Processing Program.                                                            
              %%%                                                                            
              This initiative highlights the importance of MS&E to the                       
              industrial and economic growth of the USA.  To enhance the                     
              trainees' experience, they will participate in an internship                   
              at a major US research laboratory.  Letters of commitment                      
              have been obtained from nine companies and two National                        
              Laboratories.  The trainees will have the opportunity for                      
              research at one of six European Universities and will teach                    
              in an undergraduate laboratory course at Lehigh.  To                           
              overcome barriers that dissuade US undergraduates from                         
              entering Ph. D. programs, the NSF stipends will be increased                   
              and, where possible, the time to complete the Ph. D. will be                   
              reduced through an intensive precursor Master of Science                       
              level program.
