Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Howard University seeks to provide an enrichment experience                    
              for a six week commuter program in mathematics for 36                          
              students. The program will serve 18 ninth grade and 18 tenth                   
              grade students from the metropolitan Washington, D.C. area.                    
              A variety of problem solving and hands-on activities in                        
              mathematics will be provided integrated with research                          
              activities. Students will be introduced to research                            
              methodology and will engage in a research project supervised                   
              by experienced scientists and mathematicians. Career                           
              exploration is an important aspect of the program with                         
              special interest in stimulating student career interest in                     
              mathematics and scientific fields.
