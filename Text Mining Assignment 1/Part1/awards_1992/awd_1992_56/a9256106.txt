Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Dordt College seeks to provide an enrichment experience in                     
              engineering for a three-week residential Young Scholars                        
              Program followed by academic year activities. The program                      
              will serve 45 students entering eighth and ninth grades. The                   
              project activities are designed to introduce students to                       
              various scientific and mathematical principles, particularly                   
              those involved in engineering, and reinforce them through a                    
              series of well-planned experiential activities. Activities                     
              include: lecture-oriented sessions, laboratory exercises,                      
              field trips to local business and industry, and research                       
              experiences which include student design projects.
