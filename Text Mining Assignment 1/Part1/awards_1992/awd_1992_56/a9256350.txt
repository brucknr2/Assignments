Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This Graduate Research Training award provides support to the                  
              University of Wisconsin for a program in Environmental Sociology.              
              This is part of an existing emphasis, at the graduate level, on                
              Science, Technology, Agriculture, Resources, and the Environment               
              (STARE) in the graduate Departments of Rural Sociology and                     
              Sociology at the University.  A unique concentration of (10) STARE-            
              affiliated faculty has been assembled at the University of                     
              Wisconsin, and the STARE program has been in place since 1988.                 
              This concentration of sociologists is located in one of the                    
              strongest graduate departments of sociology in the U.S., one that              
              has frequently been the top-ranked program in the country.                     
                                                                                             
              National Science Foundation support will augment STARE by helping              
              to recruit and retain minority students and those with                         
              undergraduate degrees in the natural sciences, as well as providing            
              funding stability which is lacking in new areas such as                        
              environmental sociology.  There is a pressing national need for                
              environmental sociologists to work on social aspects and                       
              implications of environmental problems.  A secondary benefit from              
              training environmental sociologists would be to broaden                        
              sociological analysis and discourse in general.  The program is                
              highlighted by a weekly training seminar, existing courses, a                  
              research apprenticeship program, a Ph.D. qualifying exam, and a                
              summer practicum.  Doctoral candidates will also be expected to                
              take a natural or environmental science minor.  Building on an                 
              already-strong program and track record of minority recruitment and            
              retention, the STARE Graduate Training Program will place strong               
              emphasis on recruitment, retention, and summer training of Native              
              Americans.
