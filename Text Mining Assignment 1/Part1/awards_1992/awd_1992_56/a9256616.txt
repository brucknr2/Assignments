Abstract    :
              This award to a group of 21 faculty from the Department of                     
              Ecology and Evolutionary Biology and the Department of Molecular               
              and Cell Biology will fund positions for 5 graduate students in a              
              training program that emphasizes the related areas of                          
              conservation biology, organismic and molecular systematics and                 
              evolution, ecology and evolution of functional diversity, and                  
              population dynamics and community ecology.                                     
                                                                                             
              Besides existing activities, the training program will include a               
              new lecture course in Conservation Biology and a new graduate                  
              seminar in Biodiversity.  The faculty's strength lies in areas of              
              tropical biology with emphasis on plants and arthropods.                       
              Training of some students will include a new program of                        
              internships at the Costa Rican National Biodiversity Institute                 
              (INBio).  The award includes some funds to be used for student                 
              recruiting, seminars, and research expenses of NSF-supported                   
              trainees.
