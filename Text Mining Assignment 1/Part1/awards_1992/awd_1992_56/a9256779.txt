Abstract    :
              This award provides funding for 5 graduate student positions in a              
              new training program in the identification, recovery and use of                
              plant genetic resources.  The 18 participating faculty come from               
              two institutions (Washington University, the Missouri Botanical                
              Garden) and the Monsanto Corporation, which is providing                       
              additional funding for the project.  The faculty bring expertise               
              in three main areas (plant and evolutionary biology, conservation              
              and systematic biology, and plant biotechnology) to the program                
              which will emphasize the identification of useful plants, the                  
              analysis of plant compounds and the genetic engineering of useful              
              traits.  Training will include two new courses, one a course in                
              natural products chemistry, the other a seminar series in plant                
              genetics resources and biotechnology.  A new internship program                
              at Monsanto will provide trainees with additional training in an               
              industrial setting.
