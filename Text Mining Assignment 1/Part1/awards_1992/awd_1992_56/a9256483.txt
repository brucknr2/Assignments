Abstract    :
                   This project will support five graduate research traineeships             
              over a five year period in the Scientific Computing and                        
              Computational Mathematics (SCCM) program at Stanford University.               
              The program is to provide training and development of new knowledge            
              in scientific computing.  The focus is on the computer as an                   
              integral part of research into either basic theoretical science and            
              engineering or into significant advances of a practical                        
              technological nature.  The program will provide a perspective which            
              incorporates many aspects of scientific computing through                      
              formulation of a model, including mathematical and numerical                   
              analysis, to practical computational aspects such as appropriate               
              computer architecture.
