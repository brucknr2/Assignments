Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                                                                                             
                                         ABSTRACT                                            
                                                                                             
                  There exists a national need for hybrid scientists trained                
              at the advanced graduate level in both biology and                             
              engineering/mathematics.  This need is created by the increasing               
              difficulty of analyzing, processing, and modeling biological data              
              that are accumulating exponentially and by the difficulty of                   
              modeling increasingly complex, biological systems.  This need is               
              manifested by the extreme difficulty of hiring faculty with the                
              requisite hybrid training.  Fortunately, this need can be met                  
              because appropriate mathematical and engineering techniques have               
              been and are being developed to cope with both the increasing                  
              data and the increasingly complex, biological systems.  For                    
              thirty years, Johns Hopkins has provided in-depth, hybrid                      
              training in biology and engineering/mathematics in its Biomedical              
              Engineering Doctoral Program.  Three new Program initiatives, in               
              Molecular and Cellular Systems Physiology, Systems                             
              Neurophysiology and Biological Imaging continue, and expand this               
              tradition.  All three of these initiatives create a fusion                     
              between the methods of modern biology and the methods of modern                
              engineering and mathematics.  Equally important (and, perhaps,                 
              unusual), each of these programs has a strongly integrative                    
              quality because each examines biological processes at multiple                 
              levels of organization.  We request support for a total of seven               
              additional students in these three areas.
