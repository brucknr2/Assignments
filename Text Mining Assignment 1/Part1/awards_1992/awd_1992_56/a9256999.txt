Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                                                                                             
                                         ABSTRACT                                            
                                                                                             
                                                                                             
                  Fires cost the American economy on the order of $128 billion              
              per year.  In recent decades, the United States has led all                    
              industrialized nations in per capita fire losses.                              
                                                                                             
                   Over the past 30 years, great advancements have been made in              
              the scientific understanding of fire behavior and the performance              
              of fire protection systems.  Indeed, a fire protection engineering             
              discipline is emerging to deal with this problem of national                   
              importance.                                                                    
                                                                                             
                   In the 1970's, Worcester Polytechnic Institute recognized the             
              growing body of knowledge in fire science and the enormous                     
              potential it had to offer for the greater social good.  In 1979, it            
              implemented the firs-of-its-kind master's degree program in fire               
              protection engineering to help the nation move forward in the                  
              development of this discipline and to produce more human resources             
              to apply new technologies to the solution of complex fire problems.            
                                                                                             
                   It was soon recognized that doctoral professionals were sorely            
              needed to write the textbooks of the future, perform leading edge              
              research, to teach and to work in industrial and government                    
              laboratories, worldwide.  Accordingly, in 1991 WPI launched the                
              first-of-its-kind doctoral degree program in fire protection                   
              engineering...building on its successful track record at the                   
              master's level.                                                                
                                                                                             
                   This Graduate Research Traineeship proposal will establish the            
              first critical mass of Ph.D. fire protection engineering scholars.             
              Five candidates will be selected as a result of an intensive                   
              nationwide recruitment campaign focusing on campus engineering                 
              society organizations and other specialty groups networked to                  
              women, minorities and students with disabilities.
