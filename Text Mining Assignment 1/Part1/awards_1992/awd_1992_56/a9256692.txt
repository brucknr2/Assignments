Abstract    :
              Professor David Allara is jointly funded by the Chemistry                      
              Division and the Graduate Education and Research Division of                   
              NSF for a Graduate Research Traineeship Program which will                     
              involve five graduate students in a core area of molecular                     
              surface chemistry.  This program will: 1) match the expertise                  
              of the core faculty in the areas of advanced surface                           
              characterization methods for polymer and biological interfaces,                
              and computational approaches to surfaces; 2) fill a recognized                 
              educational need in an area of demonstrated national                           
              importance; and 3) provide a unique educational environment for                
              graduate training in the core area. An important aspect of the                 
              program includes the creation of a central instrumentation                     
              facility which will enable students to gain familiarity with                   
              state-of-the-art research equipment.  Students will rotate                     
              between labs to gain experience in multiple experimental                       
              approaches to the core area.                                                   
              %%%                                                                            
              Molecular surface chemistry has emerged as a technical area of                 
              national importance which has a wide ranging impact on a                       
              variety of areas from biology to materials science.  It is of                  
              fundamental importance in establishing a molecular level                       
              understanding of catalysis essential to many industrial                        
              processes.  There is clearly a need for scientists who are                     
              trained in this field of science, and the support provided                     
              through this graduate traineeship grant coupled with the                       
              expertise found in the Chemistry Department at Pennsylvania                    
              State University will help to fulfill that need.
