Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              20 faculty from 3 Departments (Cell Biology, Physiology and                    
              Biophysics, Psychology) are collaborating to provide a training                
              program in cellular and molecular neuroscience.  Over its course,              
              this award will provide support for about 12 students.  A major                
              innovation in the training program is an intensive, 12 week                    
              summer laboratory course for students at the end of their first                
              year of graduate school.  The course consists of six 2-week                    
              modules in electrophysiology, developmental neurobiology,                      
              microscopy and imaging, second messengers and neurotransmitters,               
              protein biochemistry, and molecular biology.
