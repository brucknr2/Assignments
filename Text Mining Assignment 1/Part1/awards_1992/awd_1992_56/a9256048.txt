Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology will initiate a                        
              three-week, residential, Young Scholars project in                             
              mathematics for 30 students entering the 9th, 10th, 11th,                      
              and 12th grades.                                                               
                                                                                             
              This summer program will emphasize the study of mathematics                    
              including set theory, graph theory, and operations research.                   
              The project is a combination of a nine month correspondence                    
              problem solving competition and a summer session.  The                         
              program will provide participants with opportunities to                        
              improve problem solving skills, to explore coherent,                           
              axiomatic bodies of mathematics, and to investigate                            
              mathematical, scientific, and engineering disciplines as                       
              potential career choices.
