Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This proposal seeks to provide a six week summer Young                         
              Scholars program in engineering at the University of                           
              Maryland Systems Research Center. The participants will                        
              include 20 top Maryland students entering the twelfth grade.                   
              By providing a balanced exposure to class, laboratory, and                     
              field activities, the goal is to introduce Young Scholars to                   
              a cross-disciplinary spectrum of engineering and scientific                    
              fields. First-hand experiences in research will be provided                    
              to encourage and stimulate students to pursue advanced                         
              education and to discover the vast career opportunities in                     
              science and engineering.
