              sciences and engineering for 20 students entering the 11th                     
              and 12th grades.                                                               
                                                                                             
              This summer and academic year program will emphasize                           
              computer skills applied to research on electronic circuit                      
              design.  Students will conduct research at the Institute                       
              throughout the year.  They will build a digital clock from                     
              schematics, create computer programs to solve equations, and                   
              observe and discuss research methods and ethics.
