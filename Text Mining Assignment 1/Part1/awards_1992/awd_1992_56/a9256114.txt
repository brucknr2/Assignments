Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Tennessee Technology University will initiate a four-week,                     
              residential, Young Scholars project in engineering for 50                      
              students primarily from the southern Appalachian region of                     
              the U.S. entering the 11th and 12th grades.                                    
                                                                                             
              This summer program will emphasize working in design teams                     
              to develop an engineering design of a device or a system by                    
              using the university's Sun SPARCstation 1 workstations.  The                   
              program will consist of lectures in an Introduction to                         
              Engineering series, Introduction to Engineering Design, and                    
              Energy Utilization, as well as individual research projects.                   
              Field trips will be taken to various sites of engineering                      
              significance such as the Arnold Engineering Development                        
              Center (US Air Force), a TVA Power Plant, and the NISSAN                       
              Motor Manufacturing Corporation USA.
