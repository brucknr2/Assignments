Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                                                                                             
                                                                                             
                                         ABSTRACT                                            
                                                                                             
                                                                                             
                                                                                             
                  This award for $444,000 to Duke University is part of the                 
              Graduate Research Traineeship program of the Engineering                       
              Directorate.  The objective of the University's effort is to                   
              provide eight highly qualified trainees with the opportunity to                
              concentrate their doctoral level studies on nonlinear dynamics, a              
              fundamental discipline that promises to illuminate many complex                
              problems of high engineering and societal importance.  The                     
              trainees will be recruited in large part from academically non-                
              traditional backgrounds.  New recruitment activity for the                     
              trainees will be concentrated at basically liberal arts,                       
              predominantly Black schools in the region around the university.               
              The objective for the individual trainees is that they acquire                 
              the expertise to become leaders in university and/or industrial                
              research in this challenging and important discipline.
