Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                                                                                             
                                         ABSTRACT                                            
                                                                                             
                                                                                             
                  A new Molecular Bioengineering Ph.D. program has been                     
              established.  This program provides training at the interface                  
              between the physical and engineering sciences, and the                         
              bimolecular sciences.  Trainees will be uniquely able to                       
              contribute to: a) to apply engineering principles to the                       
              development of new methods for the study of bimolecular systems                
              including the human genome; and b) to create new engineering                   
              technologies based on bimolecules, molecular assemblies, and                   
              bimolecular processes.                                                         
                                                                                             
                   Support from the University and the Whitaker Foundation have              
              been combined with pre-existing faculty strength to launch this                
              program in the Center for Bioengineering.  Four new faculty with               
              expertise in areas of molecular science have been recruited.  In               
              addition, a new department of Molecular Biotechnology, with a                  
              core group of investigators from Cal Tech, is being established.               
              The Molecular Bioengineering faculty has thus grown from 5 to 13.              
              It is proposed that the current Molecular Bioengineering student               
              population of 15 be expanded to 40, using traineeships to support              
              21.  Given the importance of this emerging area, and Molecular                 
              Bioengineering's demonstrated ability to attract highly qualified              
              students (35% of whom are women), it is expected that graduates                
              of the Molecular Bioengineering Program will become leaders in                 
              both academic and industry.
