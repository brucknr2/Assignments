Abstract    :
                   A new Graduate Traineeship Program in Ultrafast Optical                   
              Sciences will be established.  The specific focus of the five                  
              traineeships will be on the University of Michigan's newly                     
              created Center for Ultrafast Optical Science (CUOS), an NSF                    
              Science and Technology Center created to enhance the nation's                  
              competitiveness in high-speed photonics and pulsed laser                       
              optics.  This is a field where a well-documented demand exists                 
              for highly trained personnel who will lead the burgeoning                      
              revolution in optical science and technology.  CUOS is                         
              inherently interdisciplinary in scope and draws on faculty and                 
              resources in several departments:  Applied Physics, Electrical                 
              Engineering, Physics, and Chemistry.  These multidisciplinary                  
              components are integrated via a common emphasis on the                         
              utilization of high peak power lasers for new areas of                         
              fundamental science, and for technological applications that                   
              exploit the special characteristics of ultrafast light pulses.                 
              This comprehensive and innovative program addresses several                    
              crucial needs in graduate education:  it aims to increase the                  
              number of American undergraduates going on to PhD studies in                   
              areas of national importance, it actively engages and nurtures                 
              underrepresented groups in the research of the Center, via a                   
              novel outreach initiative funded by University matching funds,                 
              and it addresses important issues of retention and time-to-                    
              degree by providing pre-enrollment summer research                             
              internships.
