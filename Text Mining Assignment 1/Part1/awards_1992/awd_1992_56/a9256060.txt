Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The New Jersey Institute of Technology will initiate a three-week,             
              commuter Young Scholars project in Engineering for 30 students                 
              entering grades 8,9.                                                           
                                                                                             
              The thirty, high-potential/high-ability (predominately minority)               
              students will work with faculty of NJIT and will be instructed in              
              the scientific method and research projects in engineering science             
              associated with environmental waste management.  The program will              
              include classroom and laboratory activities, seminars, and field               
              trips.  A major goal of the program will be to increase the                    
              interest and motivation of students to pursue careers in science               
              and engineering.
