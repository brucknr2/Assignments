Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Hampton University will initiate a three-week, residential Young               
              Scholars Early Alert project in Mathematics and Physics for 24                 
              minority students entering grade 7.                                            
                                                                                             
              The program will focus on student involvement in mathematics and               
              physics projects with Hampton University physics and mathematics               
              professors, scientists from a Department of Energy site, the                   
              Continuous Electron Beam Accelerator Facility (CEBAF) and NASA.                
              Project goals are to enhance mathematics and physics skills and to             
              stimulate career interest in science-related fields among young                
              minority students.
