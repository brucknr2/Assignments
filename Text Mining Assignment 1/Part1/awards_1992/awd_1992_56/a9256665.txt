Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                                                                                             
                                         ABSTRACT                                            
                                                                                             
                                                                                             
                  An innovative educational program for doctoral study in                   
              design and manufacturing is proposed.  Besides the current depth               
              in graduate programs, this program would provide cultural breadth              
              in competitive manufacturing.  Students will spend four summers                
              working in manufacturing companies: three domestic and one                     
              foreign.  Students will also be required to complete a minor in a              
              foreign language.  The research program will emphasize a unified               
              strategy to design synthesis methods, new approaches to quality                
              assurance, and advanced control methods will be the focus of the               
              doctoral research.  With these new technologies, the current                   
              separation between design, manufacturing, and quality engineering              
              disappears; instead the design and manufacturing process is                    
              unified into single, rapidly modifiable approach.  This                        
              educational and research agenda is imperative for the future                   
              competitiveness of American industries.
