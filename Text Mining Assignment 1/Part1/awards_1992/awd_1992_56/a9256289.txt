Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                                                                                             
                                         ABSTRACT                                            
                                                                                             
                  Considerable economic loss is suffered at the hands of                    
              mechanical designs that do not incorporate sufficient knowledge                
              about tribological processes.  Yet because only a handful of                   
              academic departments offer study in tribology, there remains a                 
              critical national need to produce experts in this rapidly                      
              emerging field.                                                                
                   Funds are requested from the National Science Foundation to               
              sponsor five (5) students for graduate study leading to the Ph.D.              
              in the field of tribology.  With five faculty in the tribology                 
              area, a selection of courses covering tribological topics as well              
              as extensive laboratory facilities for tribological                            
              experimentation, the George W. Woodruff School of Mechanical                   
              Engineering, is well equipped to provide academic training for                 
              sponsored GRTP students.                                                       
                   The School will aggressively recruit outstanding students                 
              will seek to promote awareness and interest in the tribology                   
              field among undergraduates.  The School will also take advantage               
              of a number of special programs to identify and attract talented               
              students from underrepresented groups.                                         
                   The GRTP students will receive a comprehensive educational                
              experience, including: (1) quality mentoring from a faculty                    
              advisor; (2) formal training in tribology fundamentals; (3)                    
              access to high quality laboratory facilities; (4) participation                
              in a graduate seminar series; (5) travel to and presentation at                
              national conferences; and (6) involvement in tribology                         
              instruction to undergraduates.
