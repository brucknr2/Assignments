Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                                                                                             
                                                                                             
                                         ABSTRACT                                            
                                                                                             
                  The national need for civil and environmental engineers to                
              address the engineering aspects of the deterioration of                        
              infrastructure facilities and the remediation of environmentally               
              damaged sites is becoming more eminent as awareness levels rise                
              and priorities change.  To meet this need the faculty in the                   
              Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering at the                       
              University of Michigan is dedicated to recruiting and training                 
              high-quality engineering professionals to serve as educators,                  
              researchers, and practitioners.  Two conditions limit our                      
              capacity to be successful:  our ability to fund quality students,              
              and our ability to attract a diverse group of American students.               
              It is well recognized that the traditional pool of candidates for              
              graduate school is dwindling, and that the talents of persons                  
              historically underrepresented in engineering must be tapped.                   
              This includes both minorities and women.  This proposal outlines               
              our intention to aggressively pursue qualified students to                     
              encourage them to join our educational program, and to prepare                 
              them for a professional career in one or more of the multi-                    
              faceted phases of Infrastructure Facilities.
