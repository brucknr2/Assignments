Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Old Dominion University will initiate a six-week,                              
              residential, Young Scholars project in applied physics and                     
              engineering for 22 students entering the 9th, 10th, and 11th                   
              grades.                                                                        
                                                                                             
              This summer year program will provide enrichment and hands-                    
              on experiences to enhance participants' knowledge of applied                   
              physics and engineering, involve students in group research                    
              projects, offer participants the opportunity to explore                        
              careers in several disciplines involving substantial                           
              applications of physics, and foster meaningful interactions                    
              between participants and scientists/engineers working in                       
              these fields.  The project will provide support and                            
              understanding to participants, offer general guidance in                       
              career planning, and help participants assess their                            
              potential for success in applied physics, engineering, and                     
              related fields.
