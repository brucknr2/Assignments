Abstract    :
                   This project will support five graduate research traineeships             
              over a five year period in the School of Electrical Engineering and            
              Computer Science at the Center for Advanced Technology in                      
              Telecommunications (CATT) of the Polytechnic University.  The                  
              specific areas to be addressed are as follows; high speed networks,            
              signal processing, and software producibility.  The traineeships               
              will be used to attract more women and underrepresented minorities             
              into doctoral studies in this field.
