Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This award to a group including 10 faculty in 4 departments                    
              (Applied Mathematics, Botany, Statistics, Zoology) provides 6                  
              positions for graduate students enrolled in an interdisciplinary               
              training program in applied mathematics and biology.  The                      
              students are to be divided among three areas of biological                     
              research: cell and developmental biology, physiology and                       
              morphology, and ecology and evolution.  The progrm will emphasize              
              the role of mathematics in understanding and guiding experimental              
              observations.  As part of its training activities, the program                 
              will offer a new "super-course" that will bring in distinguished               
              outside faculty to give series of lectures on specialized topics.
