Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The Pennsylvania State University establishes a multidisciplinary              
              program that provides training in demography and statistics as well            
              as sociology with the specific objective of preparing sociology                
              graduate students for basic research careers in family and the life            
              course.  Thematically, the program emphasizes the life course                  
              perspective and innovative methodological and statistical                      
              procedures employed by the investigators in their work on such                 
              topics as marriage, fertility, divorce, single and adolescent                  
              parenthood, child poverty, and intergenerational relations.                    
              Trainees undertake a five-year plan of study that requires                     
              completion of extensive coursework, candidacy and comprehensive                
              examinations, a research apprenticeship, and a master's thesis and             
              doctoral dissertation.  Graduate Research Trainees also gain                   
              experience giving professional presentations and teaching.  Program            
              success is ensured through active recruitment measures, faculty and            
              peer mentoring, and material support of the trainees.
