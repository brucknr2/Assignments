Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Occidental College will initiate a four-week, residential,                     
              Young Scholars project in and mathematics for 32 students                      
              entering the 9th and 10th grades.                                              
                                                                                             
              This summer and academic year program will emphasize working                   
              in small groups which focus on the processes of mathematical                   
              development:  seeking patterns, formulating conjectures,                       
              reasoning accurately, and writing and speaking clearly.                        
              Problems will be chosen from areas of discrete mathematics                     
              to illustrate basic themes of modern mathematics:  pattern,                    
              dimension, quantity, uncertainty, shape, and change.                           
              Follow-up activities include classes, lectures, career and                     
              college admission workshops, field trips, publication of                       
              student works, and required Science Fair participation.
