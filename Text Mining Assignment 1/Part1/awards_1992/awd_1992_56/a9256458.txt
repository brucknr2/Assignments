Abstract    :
              9256458  Silbey  The MIT Chemistry Department has been awarded a three year 
              Graduate Research Traineeship Grant by the Chemistry Education  Program to
              develop a traineeship program in Chemistry of the  Environment.  A group of 9
              faculty in physical, inorganic, and  chemical toxicology, will join in a
              coordinated study of the  production, dispersion, and removal of chemical
              species in the  natural environment, and their interactions with biological 
              systems.  Among the topics to be addressed are chemical  processes in the
              stratosphere; detection of trace atomospheric  pollutants; spectroscopy of
              hydrocarbon free radicals found in  combustion; synthesis of improved materials
              for fuel cells and  catalytic converters; biochemical studies of methanotrophic
               bacteria; molecular biology of environmental carcinogens; and  theoretical
              analyses of pollutant diffusion in the atmosphere.  New classroom subjects and
              seminars on the relations between  chemistry, technology, and environmental
              policy will be offered  as part of the program.  %%%  Chemical processes
              involving trace gases in the atmosphere,  such as catalytic ozone destruction,
              gobal warming due to  methane and carbon dioxide, and tropospheric pollution by
               nitrogen and sulfur oxides are now widely recognized as  critical
              environmental threats.  A principal focus of the MIT  graduate traineeship
              program will be on the kinetics and  spectroscopy of atmospheric molecules and
              radicals.  The goal  of this effort is to train a new generation of chemists
              better  equipped to understand and deal with these important  environmental
              issues.  ***
