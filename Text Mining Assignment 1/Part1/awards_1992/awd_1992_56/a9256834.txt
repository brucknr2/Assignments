Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The Cognitive Science Department at UCSD is developing a new                   
              program of training with the goal of unifying research in brain                
              science, behavioral studies, and computational theories and models.            
              Although still in the early stages of development, the program                 
              already shows real promise.  The advanced graduate students are                
              producing insightful and publishable papers that cut across these              
              disciplines.  The program's three years of experience leads to                 
              confidence that the multidisciplinary approach to the study of                 
              cognition will significantly enrich our understanding of the                   
              biological and computational bases of cognition.  These                        
              traineeships will enhance the educational experience of students by            
              permitting them undistracted time and energy to attend to the                  
              rigorous coursework and experimental research required by this new             
              discipline.  The goal of this grant is to attract intellectually               
              diverse and multiply-equipped students, with special attention to              
              minorities, women, and others who have been under-represented.
