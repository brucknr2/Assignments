Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This award to a group of 13 Faculty from 3 departments                         
              (Biological Sciences, Chemistry, and Computer Science) provides 5              
              slots for an interdisciplinary training program in biophysical                 
              approaches to cellular and developmental biology.  All faculty                 
              are members of the STC for Light Microscope Imaging and                        
              Biotechnology.  The training program will consist of six required              
              courses, four of them new interdisciplinary courses (fluorescence              
              spectroscopy, biological imaging, quantitative light microscopy                
              and computational biology.) and two of them existing advanced                  
              courses in cell biology and developmental biology that are being               
              modified to fit the program's biophysical aims.  The training                  
              will equip students with the intellectual and experimental skills              
              to pursue both basic and applied research in a multidisciplinary               
              area of great excitement.
