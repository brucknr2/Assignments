Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The Ohio State University will initiate an eight-week,                         
              residential, Young Scholars project in mathematics for 65                      
              students entering the 9th through 12th grades.                                 
                                                                                             
              This summer program will provide a vivid apprenticeship to a                   
              life of exploration for mathematically talented students.                      
              Students are exposed to higher mathematics:  definition,                       
              theorem, and proof in the spirit of "discovery" through the                    
              power of intensive involvement.  Daily problem sets are                        
              directed by lectures, seminar, and student counselors giving                   
              the students countless hours of tutorial time.  Visits by                      
              mathematicians and scientists working "in the field" and a                     
              program library help outline existing career choices and the                   
              academic backgrounds necessary to make intelligent choices.
