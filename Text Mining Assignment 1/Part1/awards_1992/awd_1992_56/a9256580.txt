Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This award to a group of 27 Faculty will provide positions for 5               
              graduate students in a new computational biology training program              
              at the Center for Computational Biology established jointly by                 
              three institutions (Rice University, Baylor College of Medicine                
              and the University of Houston).  The faculty come from                         
              Departments of Cell Biology, Biochemistry, Chemistry, Computer                 
              Science, Statistics and Electrical Engineering.  A few also                    
              participate in the STC for Research on Parallel Computation at                 
              Rice University.                                                               
                                                                                             
              The training program will emphasize visualization, algorithm                   
              development and advanced computation in biology, biochemistry and              
              biophysics.  Also included are courses offered by the individual               
              institutions, a course taught jointly by faculty from all three,               
              and a Center-sponsored seminar series.  The award includes funds               
              to be used to aid in recruiting and to promote student                         
              participation in meetings & workshops.
