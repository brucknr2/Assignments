Abstract    :
                   The principal objective of the National Science Foundation                
              Graduate Research Traineeship Program is to increase the numbers of            
              talented U.S. undergraduates enrolling in doctoral programs in                 
              critical and emerging areas of science and engineering.  Proposals             
              were solicited from institutions whose existing facilities and                 
              staff could accommodate additional graduate students in Ph.D.                  
              programs of high quality.  The program is also intended to                     
              contribute to strengthening the Nation's human resource base across            
              all geographic sectors and among all under-represented groups.                 
              Graduate Research Traineeship awards are packages of student                   
              support.  The colleges and universities that receive the awards are            
              responsible for the selection of trainees, retention of trainees,              
              and administration of traineeships.                                            
                   The University of Colorado at Boulder will initiate a focused             
              traineeship program in the areas that couple applied, nonlinear,               
              and computational mathematics.  The initiative will integrate the              
              tools of high-performance computing into the educational program               
              with supercomputer facilities at Los Alamos National Laboratories              
              (LANL) and the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR),                
              provide for summer internships at national research laboratories               
              (LANL and NCAR), and fund an industrial laboratory seminar series.             
              The department will continue to make strong efforts to recruit and             
              retain students from under-represented groups.
