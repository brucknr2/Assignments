Abstract    :
                   A new Ph.D. graduate program in Atmospheric Chemistry is in               
              the process of being developed in the Department of Chemistry and              
              Biochemistry at the University of Colorado and will be implemented             
              beginning in the Fall Semester, 1992.  The department is already               
              strong in the field of atmospheric chemistry, and with recent new              
              faculty hires and enhanced collaboration with the National Center              
              for Atmospheric Research (NCAR), the NOAA Aeronomy Laboratory and              
              the world center for the training of atmospheric chemists.                     
              Problems in the atmosphere arising from human influences include               
              stratospheric ozone depletion, acid precipitation, photochemical               
              smog, and a possible global warming.  Solutions to these problems              
              will require a new generation of scientists trained in the newly               
              emerging, interdisciplinary field of atmospheric chemistry.  The               
              traditional disciplinary approach is inadequate for training these             
              scientists needed for critical input to decision and policy making             
              for the future.  A graduate program, which includes new graduate               
              courses, has been designed by the department faculty with the help             
              of six leading atmospheric chemists as external advisors.  This                
              program will provide course work and research opportunities in such            
              areas as biogeochemical cycles, biosphere-atmosphere interactions,             
              laboratory kinetics and photochemistry, atmospheric modeling, and              
              the development of new remote sensing and field analytical                     
              techniques.
