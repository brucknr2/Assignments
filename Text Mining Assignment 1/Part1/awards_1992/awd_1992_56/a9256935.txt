Abstract    :
                   This project will support five graduate research traineeships             
              over a seven year period in the Computation and Neural Systems                 
              (CNS) Option at the California Institute of Technology.  The CNS               
              option brings together biologists, engineers, computer scientists,             
              and physicists with an interest in learning how computation is done            
              by the nervous system, and applying that knowledge to the design of            
              computers.  Work in this area is expected to lead to significant               
              advances in many engineering applications as well as neurobiology.
