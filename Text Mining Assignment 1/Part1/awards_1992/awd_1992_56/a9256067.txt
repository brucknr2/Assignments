Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This proposal seeks to initiate a four-week summer program                     
              with follow-up academic year activates for 20 students                         
              entering their senior year in high school. The program is a                    
              residential Young Scholars program in several environmental                    
              sciences. One of the major activities of the project                           
              involves each student designing an environmental based                         
              research project and pursuing active field and laboratory                      
              research in Yellowstone National Park.  Faculty members from                   
              Northwest College will serve as research scientists and                        
              mentors to the students.
