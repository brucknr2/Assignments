Abstract    :
                   The principal investigator will study weakly nonlinear                    
              waves.  The main objective will be to understand the resonance                 
              effects of small nonlinearities.  Mathematical equations                       
              modelling physical phenomena such as acoustic or water waves or                
              elastic bending of beam like structures oftentimes ignore small                
              nonlinear terms which may have accumulative effects over long                  
              time scales due to internal resonances.                                        
                   The qualitative and numerical analysis of nonlinear waves is              
              of significant scientific interest in view of the wide spread                  
              occurrence of such phenomena in real world situations.
