Abstract    :
              This proposal is to conduct:  1) an in depth study of the isotopic             
              geochemistry of the Re-Os, Sm-Nd and Rb-Sr systems and of platinum             
              group elements in basic and ultramafic rocks for the purpose of                
              studying mantle sources, their differentiation products,and their              
              evolution over the Phanerozoic; and 2) the application of 230Th and            
              other intermediate daughters of the U and Th decay series to the               
              dating of Holocene and late Pleistocene volcanics and the                      
              relationship of these volcanics to magma sources and the times of              
              formation of phenocrysts.  In addition to samples at hand, filed               
              work will be conducted to obtain very fresh materials at key                   
              localities.  These problems will be attacked over a three-year                 
              period, using newly developed mass spectrometric techniques of                 
              negative thermal ion mass spectrometry of the platinum group                   
              elements and a new generation high abundance sensitivity mass                  
              spectrometer (abundance sensitivity better than 5 x 10-10 for 2                
              amu) with high transmission.  Recently developed analytical                    
              chemical procedures will be used to separate elements at ultra low             
              level concentrations efficiently and with negligible contamination.            
              This work should result in new scientific understanding on the                 
              origins of the rocks to be studied, as well as the development of              
              improved analytical techniques.
