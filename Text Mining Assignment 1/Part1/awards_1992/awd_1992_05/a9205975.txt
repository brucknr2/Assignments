Abstract    :
                   Recent discovery of shatter cones and fluidal breccias                    
              resembling impactites in Precambrian rock of southwestern Montana              
              signal the possible presence of a large impact structure.  The                 
              shatter cones are in rocks of the Cabin thrust sheet at the                    
              culmination of the southwestern Montana recess in the boundary                 
              between the Cordilleran thrust belt and the Rocky Mountain                     
              foreland.  This study will test the validity of the "impact                    
              structure" interpretation by field documentation of shatter cone               
              distribution and orientation and by laboratory analysis of the                 
              fluidal breccias.  The results of this study will increase our                 
              understanding of impact structures and of their possible influence             
              on subsequent orogenic processes.
