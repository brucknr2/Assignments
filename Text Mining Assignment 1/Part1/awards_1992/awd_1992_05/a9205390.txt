Abstract    :
                   Until now, seismic Modelling of three dimensional Earth                   
              structure and the study of mantle convection have been performed               
              separately, with the latter occasionally employing, a posteriori,              
              the results of the former.  One objective of this project is to                
              further advance understanding of mantle dynamics by performing                 
              simultaneous inversions of long-period seismic waveform data and               
              geodynamic data consisting of the observed plate velocities and                
              nonhydrostatic geoid.  The second objective is to further refine               
              previous treatments of viscous flow in the mantle.  The                        
              simultaneous consideration of seismic and geodynamic data will help            
              to stabilize the seismic inverions in those geographical areas that            
              are poorly resolved and it will also allow one to address important            
              issues in solid-Earth physics and geodyamics.
