Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              In contrast to the sex chromosome systems of mammals and birds, the            
              sex of many reptiles is determined by the incubation temperature               
              of the egg (temperature-dependent sex-determination, or TSD). Sex              
              determination under TSD can also be controlled by the artificial               
              application of specific steroid hormones, whereby the effects of               
              temperature are overridden. The proposed work pursues this                     
              interplay in a turtle with TSD. The study has two specific aims.               
                                                                                             
              The first aim is to study further the physiological bases of TSD               
              by (i) localizing key enzymes during the temperature-sensitive                 
              window, and (ii) capitalize on a recent discovery that exogenous               
              androgen can cause male development. The second aim extends our                
              line of research into the molecular biology of TSD/HSD to identify,            
              map, and quantify steroid hormone receptors in the developing                  
              embryo. Together these studies will serve to generalize and unite              
              anatomical, physiological, and molecular observations. The basic               
              research proposed here has applications to the conservation of                 
              endangered reptiles.
