Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Description:  This project supports living expenses for four                   
              Indian scientists and graduate students to participate in a                    
              multi-institution experiment at Fermi Laboratory.   The                        
              experiment E706 is designed to study interactions of protons,                  
              pions and kaons in a variety of targets, triggering on high                    
              transverse momentum (>5 GeV/C) electromagnetic showers.  It is a               
              second generation fixed target experiment using high energy beams              
              (800 GeV protons from Fermilab Tevatron) and with a wide                       
              acceptance spectrometer, it is intended to reach approximately 10              
              GeV/C.  A goal of the experiment is to obtain information on                   
              quark and gluon interactions in collisions of positive pions,                  
              negative pions and protons with nucleons.  The Indian scientists               
              participation includes building detectors, data acquisition and                
              data analysis.                                                                 
                                                                                             
              Scope:  This is a renewal of work currently under the leadership               
              of Dr. Peoples at Fermilab, Dr. Paul Slattery of the University                
              of Rochester, and of Dr. R. Shivpuri of the University of Delhi.               
              The collaboration is considered quite successful, and a number of              
              joint publications have resulted.  The project fits the U.S.-                  
              India Cooperative Science Program objectives.
