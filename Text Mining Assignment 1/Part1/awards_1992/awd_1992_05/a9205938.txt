Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The widespread existence of teleplanic or "long distance" larvae               
              of sublittoral invertebrates in the tropical epipelagic waters of              
              the central Pacific, Atlantic and Indian Oceans supports the                   
              hypothesis that larvae contribute importantly not only to initial              
              colonization of oceanic islands and, more generally, to the                    
              present continuous or disjunct ranges of such species, but also                
              to the continuing genetic exchange among islands or even between               
              islands and far distant continental populations.  However, no one              
              has yet demonstrated in any systematic way that teleplanic larvae              
              are capable of metamorphosing at the time of their collection in               
              the open sea.  We do not yet know whether teleplanic larvae are                
              physiologically adapted for remaining planktonic over long                     
              periods of time or whether the lack of further growth already                  
              documented instead is due to low phytoplankton concentrations in               
              the open ocean. The future research will address these two                     
              questions 1) by obtaining larvae in the open ocean and ascertain               
              experimentally whether or not these larvae are competent to                    
              metamorphose, (2) by maintaining larvae in the laboratory to                   
              determine whether individuals that would not metamorphose in the               
              sea eventually become competent to metamorphose, and 3) by                     
              determining whether or not teleplanic larvae are physiologically               
              capable of further growth given adequate phytoplankton                         
              concentrations or alternatively whether growth stasis, i.e., a                 
              quasi-holoplanktonic state, is achieved.
