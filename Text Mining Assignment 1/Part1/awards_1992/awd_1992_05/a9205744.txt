Abstract    :
                   The primary goal of this proposal is to reconstruct                       
              continuous, quantitative biogenic and terrigenous deposition                   
              records from downhole logs and core data at ODP Site 798 on the                
              Oki Ridge, Sea of Japan.  We employ an innovative and efficient                
              research strategy whereby continuous, multivariable log data are               
              calibrated using "ground-truth" sediment lithological information              
              obtained from cores.  Site 798 was the Leg 128 target for a                    
              complete late Neogene paleoceanographic "reference" section for                
              this climatically-important region; however, sporatic core                     
              recovery precludes a solely core-based reconstruction of these                 
              records below ca. 1 Myr.                                                       
                   We describe separate core-based and log-based lines of                    
              research whose products will be merged to reconstruct sediment                 
              component percentage and flux records for the last 3 Myr.                      
              Discrete core sections are analyzed for biogenic opal, carbonate,              
              organic carbon, and terrigenous percent using contiguous 30-cm                 
              "channel" samples which mimic log resolution.  Ash layers provide              
              accurate core-log depth correlations, and oxygen isotopic data                 
              are used to define glacial-interglacial stratigraphy,                          
              sedimentation rates, and phasing relationships.  New                           
              computational techniques developed by Schlumberger-Doll Research               
              are used to enhance the log resolution and sensitivity.  These                 
              and other statistical techniques are used to quantitatively                    
              relate specific electrical, chemical, and physical log responses               
              to the measured core lithological variations.  The continuous                  
              percentage and flux records developed from this research provide               
              us with an unique opportunity to: 1) Evaluate the utility of                   
              downhole logging methods to paleoclimate research, and 2)                      
              Understand the Pliocene-Pleistocene evolution of Japan Sea                     
              paleoceanography and paleoclimate within the context of other                  
              global climate records.
