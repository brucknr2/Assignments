Abstract    :
                   The time interval represented by the Vendian period and its               
              transition into the Cambrian is one of the most significant in the             
              evolution of the earth.  Major tectonic, biologic and geochemical              
              events occurred on a global scale and include the growth and                   
              reorganization of supercontinent, significant fluctuations in sea              
              level and climate, the advent of soft-bodied and small shelly                  
              metazoans, the isotopic and trace element composition of seawater,             
              and the composition of the atmosphere.  Most of these events are               
              represented in the record of sediments that spans the Vendian-                 
              Cambrian transition, and which is preserved on all continents.                 
                   The research will be a detailed investigation of the                      
              stratigraphy, sedimentology, and geochronology of the Nama basin               
              (Namibia) developed during Vendian and early Cambrian time.  This              
              work will test specific hypotheses concerning, for example, the                
              mechanisms(s) of basin subsidence, origin of stratigraphic                     
              sequences and boundaries, and the absolute ages of critical fossil             
              and trace fossil assemblages (e.g. Ediacaran fauna, Cloudina,                  
              Phycodes pedum, the Precambrian-Cambrian boundary, and carbon                  
              isotopic and strontium isotopic curves.  The work will be                      
              supplemented by high resolution U-Pb zircon dating of numerous                 
              volcanic ash beds intercalated throughout the sequence, thereby                
              providing one of the best calibrated sections in the world through             
              this critical time interval.
