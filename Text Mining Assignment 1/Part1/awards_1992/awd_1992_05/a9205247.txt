Abstract    :
              "Freeze" is a displacement pile/soil interaction that happens                  
              over time and often results in a major increase in pile capacity.              
              This improvement in capacity, which for the most part is due to                
              side friction increase, is well known to practicing engineers,                 
              but poorly understood and therefore underutilized.  The proposed               
              research will study the pore pressure and aging phenomena                      
              involved with side friction freeze using the time-accelerating                 
              advantages of centrifuge modeling.  Model insitu testing in the                
              centrifuge and full scale tests insitu will be used to evaluate                
              their potential as predictor tests for pile freeze.
