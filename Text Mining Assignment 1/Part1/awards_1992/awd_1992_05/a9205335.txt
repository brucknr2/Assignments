Abstract    :
              This U.S.-Mexico award supports Professor Janos                                
              Fendler of Syracuse University in a research                                   
              collaboration with Professor Luz Alicia Focugauchi                             
              of the Instituto Nacional de Investigaciones                                   
              Nucleares in Mexico.  The researchers intend to                                
              prepare and characterize surfactant-vesicle-                                   
              entrapped semiconductors, liquid crystals, and                                 
              polymerized liquid crystals.                                                   
                                                                                             
              Molecules that contain hydrophilic and hydrophobic                             
              regions are called surfactants (surface active                                 
              agents), amphiphiles, or simple detergents.  They                              
              are the building blocks for aqueous and reverse                                
              micelles, microemulsions, liquid crystals,                                     
              polymerized liquid crystals, vesicles, and                                     
              polymerized vesicles.  All of these systems have a                             
              common theme in that they mimic the functions of                               
              biological membranes.  For this research, the U.S.                             
              investigator will contribute his expertise in many                             
              facets of membrane mimetic chemistry, while the                                
              Mexican investigator will bring to bear her                                    
              expertise in the application of positron                                       
              annihilation techniques to the study of surfactant                             
              based organized media.
