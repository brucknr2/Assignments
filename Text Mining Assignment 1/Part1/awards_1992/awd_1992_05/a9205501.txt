Abstract    :
                   The ongoing collision of the Indian subcontinent with southern            
              Asia has produced the Himalayan Range and the Tibetan Plateau; the             
              highest present-day topography on the earth's surface.  Decades of             
              structural studies have documented large amounts of shortening                 
              within the Himalaya, and more recent isotopic studies have begun               
              to delineate the history of uplift during this shortening.  Large              
              amounts of erosional and tectonic denudation are required to                   
              reconcile the calculated crustal uplift with the present                       
              topography.  This denudation has caused a massive sediment flux                
              from the hinterland into the basins bounding the Himalaya:  the                
              Indo-Gangetic foreland, the Tarim basin, the Indus Cone, and the               
              Bengal Fan.  The research proposed here will attempt to examine                
              this sediment flux to the south of the Himalaya in order to                    
              determine: 1) how much and at what rates sediment has been stored              
              in the past within the potential sediment sinks bounding the                   
              southern margin of the Himalaya; 2) the presence or absence of                 
              synchronous changes in the rates of sediment storage between the               
              foreland and the marine fan systems and within different parts of              
              the foreland (partitioning of the sediment load); 3) modern rates              
              of sediment delivery out of the hinterland for a major and minor               
              river that debouch into the Himalayan foreland in northern                     
              Pakistan; 4) an estimate of the amount of sediment storage that                
              occurs within the hinterland itself and a comparison of the                    
              relative storage in monsoonal dominated versus semi-arid,                      
              nonmonsoonal drainages; and 5) volumetric approximations based on              
              digital elevation data of erosional losses within selected parts               
              of the uplifted hinterland.
