Abstract    :
              The principal investigator will measure infrared spectra of                    
              important minerals at high temperature and pressure.  From these               
              data she will extract both thermodynamic and elastic information               
              on these substances.  The ultimate goal is to deduce the                       
              composition and thermal character of the Earth's interior by                   
              relating the data to seismic models.
