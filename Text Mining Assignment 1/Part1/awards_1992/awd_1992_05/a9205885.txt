Abstract    :
                   Many of the really exciting advances in sciences are now                  
              being made in highly interdisciplinary environments; and many of               
              the important aspects revolve around statistical issues. This                  
              conference will provide a forum in which to examine three broad                
              directions of expansion of multivariate analysis.  These include               
              new directions in graphics, robust estimation, multiple time                   
              series, bootstrapping and meta analysis.  The impact of                        
              multivariate environmental statistics on environmental research,               
              policy and management is a second focus of the conference which                
              will also address contemporary statistical issues relating to the              
              environment, to ecology and to environmental health.  Technical                
              sessions are planned on multidimensional signal processing with                
              participation of specialists in this area with expertise in                    
              statistics and probability and from engineering.
