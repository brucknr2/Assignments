Abstract    :
                          9205668  Maes        This is the third year funding of a three-year
              continuing grant.  Intelligent interface  agents are computer programs that
              employ artificial intelligence and other techniques  in order to provide
              expert, autonomous assistance to a user dealing with particular  computer
              applications.   This research addresses the question of learning as a method 
              by which an agent can acquire sufficient amounts of information about the user,
              the  application, and the communication and collaboration strategies to be able
              to empower  the user.   The goal of this project is to find the necessary and
              sufficient conditions  for the hypothesis to hold that an interface agent can
              be given access to the  information it needs to program itself.  The agent is
              given a minimum of background  knowledge and learns appropriate
              situation-action rules by observing the user's  interaction with the
              application, by receiving feedback from the user about certain  rules, and by
              copying the situation-action rules employed by agents assisting other  users in
              the same application.  The project will first develop a generic architecture
              for  building learning interface agents.  This will then be used in concrete
              examples to test  the main hypothesis.
