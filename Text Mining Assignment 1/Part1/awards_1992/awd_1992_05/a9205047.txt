Abstract    :
               This project deals with volume synthesis, its theoretical  framework, its
              underlying voxelization algorithms for  synthesizing volumetric (voxel-based)
              objects from their  geometric description, and its discrete rendering
              algorithms  for visualizing these objects.  The three main objectives of this
              research are:  (1) to study the theoretical framework in 3D discrete topology 
              for the voxelization and discrete rendering algorithms in  order to guarantee
              the generation of a `well-behaved` discrete  representation in terms of
              connectivity, thickness,  separability, minimization, coverage, and accuracy; 
              (2) to develop and implement efficient voxelization algorithms  for 3D lines,
              3D circles, surfaces, and solids, using a  variety of connectivities,
              thicknesses, and spatial  occupancies, with a specific focus on both binary and
              non-  binary (`fuzzy`) voxelization; and  (3) to develop and implement discrete
              algorithms that  capitalize on the discrete representation of the volume buffer
               for fast viewing of the scene, using approaches such as  volumetric ray
              tracing and template-based projection.
