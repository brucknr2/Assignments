Abstract    :
                   The Department of Mathematics at Rice University will                     
              purchase the following equipment: one file server, one compute                 
              server, two hard disks, one compact disk reader (CDROM), six X-                
              window terminals (one with color monitor), hardware to connect                 
              terminals to system, one printer, and the software Mathematica.                
                                                                                             
                   This equipment will be dedicated to support research in the               
              mathematical sciences.  The equipment will be used for projects                
              in Differential Geometry and Analysis by Robert Hardt, Michael                 
              Wolf and Robin Forman, Linking Phenomena in Three-Dimensions by                
              Tim Cochran, and in Ergodic Theory and Combinatorial Number                    
              Theory by Michael Boshernitzan.                                                
                   The methods employed will stress symbolic, algebraic and                  
              graphical computation applied to problems of inherent scientific               
              interest by researchers well-established in their fields.
