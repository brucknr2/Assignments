Abstract    :
              This project will provide insight into the molecular mechanism of              
              ionic conduction in ion channels.  The work will be theoretical                
              and will attempt to model the interaction of the permeating ion                
              with different side groups while it travels along the tunnel of                
              the ion channel, driven by an electrochemical gradient.  Since                 
              the detailed three-dimensional structure of biological ion                     
              channels has not yet been determined, the investigator proposes                
              to tackle this problem by using a well studied ion channel with a              
              known 3-D structure (gramicidin A).  The proposed studies focus                
              on utilizing a hierarchy of models that will gradually                         
              reconstruct permeation up to the ms time range.  The modelling                 
              attempts will cover: (i) molecular dynamics simulations to                     
              generate the paths and energy profiles for the permeating ions,                
              (ii) computation of the Langevin equation using the results of                 
              the molecular dynamics simulation, and (iii) to use the theory of              
              renewal processes, to predict measurable parameters such as the                
              probability of occupancy, current/voltage relationships, open                  
              channel noise and other measurable single ion channel phenomena.               
              The goal of (i) and (ii) is to evaluate how the structure of the               
              tunnel of a channel changes when it is occupied by ions, and the               
              goal of (iii) is to predict the properties of single ion channels              
              like the rate of transport, selectivity and open channel noise.
