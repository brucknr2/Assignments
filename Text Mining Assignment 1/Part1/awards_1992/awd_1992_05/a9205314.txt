Abstract    :
              The principal investigator will develop a new method for                       
              determining D/H fractionation factors for systems of geologic                  
              interest. The primary goal of the study is to determine partition              
              function ratios of common hydrous minerals as a function of                    
              temperature and thereby establish a self-consistent set of                     
              fractionation factors for application to geochemical problems. This            
              will help resolve major discrepancies in the literature. The                   
              information will also be of considerable theoretical and physical              
              chemical interest.
