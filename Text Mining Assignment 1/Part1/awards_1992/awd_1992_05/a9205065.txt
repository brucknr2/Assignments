Abstract    :
                     Continental basins resulting from extension are complex, being          
              influenced by the style of normal faulting, reactivation of older              
              features and local climatic conditions.  This project will examine             
              in some detail the depositional and structural evolution of the                
              Great Salt Late Basin at the eastern edge of the Basin and Range               
              Province.  The work will integrate seismic, stratigraphic and                  
              paleoecologic data with three-dimensional basin depositional                   
              modeling in order to produce a detailed interpretation of how this             
              basin developed through the Neogene.  Results will add to the                  
              understanding of the interaction of tectonics, climate and                     
              deposition in a continental extensional environment.
