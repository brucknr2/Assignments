Abstract    :
              This is for continued support of three separate programs of                    
              research in radiogenic isotope geochemistry as applied to                      
              hydrothermal processes, silicic magma systems and mantle                       
              geochemistry.  1. The research in hydrothermal processes will                  
              emphasize the further development of techniques for determining the            
              timing and scales of fluid movement.  These techniques may include             
              dating of fluid inclusions, dating of sulfides, dating of                      
              carbonates, phosphates and accessory mineral overgrowths, and REE              
              analysis of a variety of hydrothermal phases including sulfides and            
              fluorite.  Research will be concentrated on MIssissippi Valley Type            
              (MVT) deposits and pluton-related mineralization in the U.S. and               
              U.K.  2. Studies of silicic magma systems will focus on dating of              
              magma differentiation using Rb-Sr techniques, the longevity of                 
              magma chamber residence by resolving differentiation ages from                 
              eruption ages, and the study of mass transfer within silicic                   
              systems.  A number of systems in the U.S. and elsewhere have been              
              chosen for study.  3. Current research on the geochemistry of the              
              mantle under the Cameroon line is to be expanded to study trace                
              element enrichment processes as a function of lithospheric age                 
              using lavas and/or ultramafic xenoliths from various volcanic                  
              centers.  In addition, techniques for dating young MORB using                  
              40Ar-39Ar are being developed.
