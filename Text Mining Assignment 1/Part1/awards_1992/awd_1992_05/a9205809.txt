Abstract    :
                   Plasmodium falciparum unexpectedly has two organelle-like                 
              genomes.  One has characteristics reminiscent of chloroplast DNAs              
              while the other appears to be a highly unusual mitochondrial                   
              genome.  The putative mitochondrial genome is very small and                   
              encodes small regions with homology to ribosomal RNA in a                      
              discontinuous and scrambled manner.  Conserved core regions are                
              retained but variable regions are largely absent.  The                         
              characteristics of the rRNA fragments suggest that they may be                 
              functional in ribosomes.  This proposal is designed to determine if            
              the fragments are in fact in ribosomes and to assess some of the               
              characteristics of those ribosomes.  The discontinuous rRNA                    
              fragments will be mapped and compared to other rRNAs, looking for              
              conserved structure-function correlations.  The presence of the                
              discontinuous fragments in particles will be evaluated and the                 
              general characteristics of such particles determined.  The                     
              subcellular location of the putative mitochondrial genome will be              
              evaluated and investigations of ribosome function will be                      
              initiated.                                                                     
              %%%                                                                            
              The unusual nature of the discontinuous rRNAs suggests that                    
              understanding their role in ribosomes will increase understanding              
              of fundamental ribosomal functions.
