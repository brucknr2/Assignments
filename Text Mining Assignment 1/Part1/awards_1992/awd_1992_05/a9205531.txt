Abstract    :
                   The basic goal in this proposed research is to consider                   
              iterative methods for large sparse nonsymmetric nonsingular                    
              systems of equations  Gx = b.  Iterative methods for such                      
              equations have received much attention in recent years.  Many of               
              the new iterative schemes are modifications of the conjugate                   
              gradient method.                                                               
                   Such studies are of considerable importance in numeric and                
              computational areas.  Applications arise in a large number of                  
              scientific and engineering areas.
