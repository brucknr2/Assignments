Abstract    :
                   The objective of this project is to measure several important             
              products of atmospheric photolysis including the hydroxyl radical,             
              and gas phase sulfuric and methanesulfonic acids using a mass                  
              spectrometric technique.  In addition , the instrument used to                 
              perform these measurements will be modified to make possible                   
              shipboard and aircraft studies.                                                
                   A recent informal intercomparison between the mass                        
              spectrometric measurement technique and a NOAA long path laser                 
              absorption technique resulted in similar concentrations of OH being            
              measured by both instruments.  The measured hydroxyl radical                   
              concentrations were however, consistently well below model                     
              predictions.  In order to investigate these discrepancies these                
              scientists will participate in an additional  hydroxyl radical                 
              intercompaion and photochemistry experiment in Colorado during the             
              summer of 1993.  A second study to isolate possible effects of                 
              vegetation and other near-ground loss mechanisms on hydroxyl                   
              radical concentration will also be undertaken.  Modifications to               
              the present system would also be undertaken to make possible                   
              measurements on a mobile platform for future studies.
