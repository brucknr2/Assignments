Abstract    :
                   This award supports work on motives and algebraic cycles.                 
              One of the principal investigators will work on motivic                        
              cohomology; a non-archimedean generalization of the Riemann-Roch               
              type theorem proved by Gillet and Soule; and a generalization of               
              Iwasawa theory to cycles and motives.  The other principal                     
              investigator will work on the existence of higher logarithms                   
              using families of certain linear configurations over the                       
              Grassmannians, as well as explore the relationship between the                 
              Grassmannian complex and the K-groups of the ground field.                     
                   This is research in the field of algebraic geometry, one of               
              the oldest parts of modern mathematics, but one which has had a                
              revolutionary flowering in the past quarter-century.  In its                   
              origins, it treated figures that could be defined in the plane by              
              the simplest equations, namely polynomials.  Nowadays, the field               
              makes use of methods not only from algebra, but from analysis and              
              topology, and conversely is finding application in those fields                
              as well as in theoretical computer science and robotics.
