Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              We have developed an assay that permits the in vivo monitoring of              
              steroid receptor protein nuclear export. In this assay co-cultured             
              heterologous cells are fused using polyethylene glycol to generate             
              multi-nucleated heterokaryon with shared cytoplasm. Since only one             
              of the two cell types used to generate a heterokaryon will contain             
              receptor protein within its nucleus (i.e. the donor cell), any                 
              receptor detected within the heterologous nucleus of the original              
              receptor cell type (i.e. recipient cell) must derive from protein              
              that exported from the donor cell nucleus. This assay will be used             
              to determine whether the glucocorticoid, progesterone, and thyroid             
              hormone receptors possess the capacity to export in isolation when             
              fused to heterologous proteins that do not normally have this                  
              capacity. We anticipate that this system of analysis will provide              
              novel insights into the mechanisms that regulate bi-directional                
              movement of proteins across the nuclear envelope.
