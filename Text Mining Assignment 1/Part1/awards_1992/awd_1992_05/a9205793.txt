Abstract    :
              The principal investigator will experimentally study the high                  
              pressure/temperature equilibrium and kinetic properties of crustal-            
              rock accessory minerals, especially zircon. Natural samples of                 
              these minerals will then be used as recorders of crustal processes.            
              The goal is to be able to interpret the geologic record in as much             
              detail as possible.
