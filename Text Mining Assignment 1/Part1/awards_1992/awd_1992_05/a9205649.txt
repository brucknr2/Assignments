Abstract    :
                   Exhumation processes of deep crustal rocks are still poorly               
              understood.  Exceptionally deep exposures of Caledonian continental            
              crust within the Bergen Arcs of western Norway regionally expose               
              granulite to eclogite transition rocks, thus offering a window into            
              the roots of a continent-continent collisional orogenic system that            
              subsequently was unroofed.  This project will derive P-T-t paths               
              from metamorphic relationships, thermobarometry and geochronology.             
              Systematic observations of the structural relationships combined               
              with the petrologic and geochronologic results should provide                  
              significant insights into both the tectonic evolution of this deep             
              crustal portion of the Caledonides and the understanding of                    
              orogenic processes in continent-continent collisional belts.
