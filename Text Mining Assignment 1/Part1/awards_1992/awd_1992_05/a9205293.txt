Abstract    :
                   The principal investigator will continue his study of                     
              minimal surfaces in spaces of constant mean curvature. In                      
              particular he will study surfaces of higher genus such as the                  
              torus embedded in the sphere. The techniques to be used involve                
              integrable systems in infinite dimensional spaces. This technique              
              is very different from the standard methods used to study these                
              problems thus far.                                                             
                   This award will support research in the general area of                   
              differential geometry and global analysis. Differential geometry               
              is the study of the relationship between the geometry of a space               
              and analytic concepts defined on the space. Global analysis is                 
              the study of the overall geometric and topological properties of               
              a space by piecing together local information. Applications of                 
              these areas of mathematics in other sciences include the                       
              structure of complicated molecules, liquid-gas boundaries, and                 
              the large scale structure of the universe.
