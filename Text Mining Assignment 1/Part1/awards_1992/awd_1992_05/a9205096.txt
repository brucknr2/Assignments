Abstract    :
                   This collaborative investigation with G. Dunne of California              
              State University at Northridge will study structural and                       
              geochronological events on the eastern side of the Sierra Nevada               
              in east-central California.  The research will address the                     
              chronology of formation of the Sierran Arc during the Mesozoic and             
              the timing of major deformation episodes in the eastern Sierran                
              thrust system.  U/Pb dating of zircons from selected volcanic and              
              intrusive rocks in the region will provide the time constraints.               
              The results of this study will have broad implication for the                  
              evaluation of continental margin magmatic arcs in this and other               
              tectonic settings.
