Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              During its growth the maize shoot progresses through distinct                  
              juvenile and adult phases of vegetative growth and then enters a               
              reproductive phase.  Previous work has suggested that these three              
              phases are regulated by independent, but interacting developmental             
              programs.  The extent of coordination between these programs will              
              be tested by studying the effect of "early flowering" genes on                 
              phase-specific vegetative traits, and by examining the interaction             
              between these genes and several mutations that cause the                       
              constitutive expression of a juvenile vegetative program (Tp1, Tp2             
              and Tp3).  To obtain a more complete picture of the genetic                    
              regulation of phase change, several recently identified mutations              
              that affect the expression of phase specific vegetative traits will            
              be characterized at a cellular and molecular level.  Other genes               
              that regulate phase change will be identified by screening for                 
              suppressors of Tp2, and by screening for mutations that cause the              
              precocious expression of adult vegetative traits.  Finally, g115,              
              a gene that regulates several juvenile traits, will be cloned by               
              transposon-tagging.
