Abstract    :
                    A detailed field and experimental investigation of the                   
              mechanisms responsible for fault zone weakness will be conducted               
              by collaborators with expertise in the natural and experimental                
              deformation of rocks.  The study will concentrate on fault gauge               
              from the San Andreas, Punchbowl and San Gabriel faults as these                
              faults are thought to have slipped under small resolved shear                  
              stresses.  The results of this study will provide an independent               
              estimate of the mechanisms responsible for slip localization along             
              faults of the San Andreas system, and will be of considerable                  
              importance to studies of major shallow-level fault zones worldwide.
