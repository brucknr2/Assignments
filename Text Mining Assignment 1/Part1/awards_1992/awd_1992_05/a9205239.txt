Abstract    :
              The Department of Mathematics of the University of Illinois at                 
              Urbana-Champaign will purchase a compute server, workstations,                 
              and other supporting equipment, which will be dedicated to the                 
              support of research in the mathematical sciences.  The equipment               
              will be used for several research projects, including in                       
              particular: unproved claims left by Ramanujan in his notebooks;                
              implementing computational abstract mathematics, extending work                
              on finite category theory and the lambda calculus; graphs and                  
              associated simple Lie algebras via an embedding of graphs into                 
              inner product spaces over GF(2); quasisolutions for finding                    
              explicit solutions of some nonlinear PDE's; and connections                    
              between groups and finite state automata.
