Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Dr. Schooley will study an enzyme, called JH-specific epoxide                  
              hydrolase (JHEH), thought to be important in regulating juvenile               
              hormone (JH) levels in insects. JH levels in insects are believed              
              to be controlled partly by the rate of hormone degradation. A dogma            
              has developed that the drop in JH level required for pupation of               
              insects including moths and butterflies is due mainly to the JH-               
              specific esterase. He has preliminary evidence that JHEH is at                 
              least as important as the esterase enzyme, if not more so. He will             
              characterize the enzyme in live insects and in insect extracts to              
              gain an understanding of its importance in controlling JH level.               
              He will do this by studying JH metabolism as a function of                     
              development and by studying the rate of metabolism of different                
              kinds of JH. He will determine portions of the protein sequence of             
              the pure, isolated enzyme, and then isolate a molecular clone of               
              the gene encoding the enzyme in order to determine the complete                
              sequence of the enzyme. He will also test how enzyme levels are                
              controlled by studying the levels of messenger RNA coding for the              
              enzyme.
