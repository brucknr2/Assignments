Abstract    :
              The Institute for Scientific Computing and Applied Mathematics at              
              Indiana University will upgrade its set of workstations and                    
              acquire graphic workstations, a laser color printer and some                   
              video material.  This equipment will be dedicated to support                   
              research projects concerning the approximation and bifurcation of              
              attractors, the numerical study of collisionless plasmas, the                  
              development of new algorithms related to the incremental unknowns              
              methods, and their application to fluid mechanics.
