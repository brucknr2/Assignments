Abstract    :
                   Although considerable progress has been made in understanding             
              of the mechanics of thin-skinned contractional belts, it has been              
              difficult to rigorously test theoretical models due mainly to the              
              lack of adequate data, particularly from tectonically active                   
              examples.  This project will refine theoretical models of the                  
              effects of basement obstructions on this thin-skinned tectonics and            
              other issues and test them using examples from the Salt Range,                 
              Sulaiman fold belt and the Chaman fault of Pakistan.   Results                 
              should result in more vigorously tested models of the mechanics of             
              fold-thrust belts.
