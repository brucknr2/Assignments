Abstract    :
              A new family of Ca2+-dependent protein kinases, called CDPKs, has              
              recently been discovered.  CDPKs are unique because they have a                
              novel structure with a kinase domain joined to a Ca2+-binding                  
              domain similar to calmodulin.  An important long term goal is to               
              understand the function of CDPKs in Ca2+-mediated signal                       
              transduction pathways.  The model plant system Arabidopsis has been            
              chosen for this purpose.  The foundation of the proposal is to                 
              determine how Ca2+ regulates CDPK activity.  A biochemical and                 
              molecular genetic approach will be used to test a model referred               
              to as a "stream-lined version of CaMK II".  An E. coli. expression             
              system has been developed to provide functional enzyme for this                
              purpose.  Two approaches will be pursued to investigate the                    
              biological functions of a specific CDPK isoform:  1) Isoform AK1               
              and a mutant "unregulated" version of AK1, will be over-expressed              
              in transgenic plants to examine the effects of altering the balance            
              of its activity in vivo.  2) AK1's intracellular location will be              
              determined to provide information on its potential in vivo                     
              substrates.
