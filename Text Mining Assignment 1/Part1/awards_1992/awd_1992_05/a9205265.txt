Abstract    :
                   This project addresses several problems form the area of                  
              information theory and coding.  In the area of channel coding,                 
              the work will address error correction and modulation codes for                
              storage channels, techniques for burst error correction coding,                
              codes which detect unidirectional error patterns and correct                   
              random error patterns , and multi-user channel coding from a                   
              unified information theory and network theory point of view.  In               
              the source coding area, the research will consider the problems                
              of estimation through compressed information, Huffman codes with               
              reservations, and some adaptive lossy data compression                         
              algorithms.
