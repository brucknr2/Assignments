Abstract    :
              This fifth annual "Mouse Molecular Genetics" meeting will be held              
              at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratories in Long Island, N.Y., on                    
              August 26-30.  The emphasis of the meeting will be on the mouse as             
              an organism and will cover such areas as:  regulation of gene                  
              expression in development, pattern formation in development, roles             
              of receptors and their signals, and molecular analysis of                      
              mutations.                                                                     
                                                                                             
              This has been an increasingly successful meeting over the last four            
              years, fulfilling a very important role in facilitation of                     
              communication between various disciplines in the use of mice to                
              study fundamental problems in biology.
