Abstract    :
              Controlled - environment chambers will be obtained for use                     
              in botanical studies.  Research by A.J. Shaw will                              
              investigate mechanisms of sex ratio determination in natural                   
              populations of bryophytes.  Single spore cultures will be                      
              isolated from a population and differences between male and                    
              female gametophytes in ecologically important traits will be                   
              assessed.  J.M. Bernard will investigate the effects of                        
              temperature on life history characteristics, including                         
              inorganic nutrition and carbon allocation, in wetland                          
              plants, Growth chambers will allow Dr. Bernard and                             
              collaborating undergraduate students to expand previous                        
              field studies by testing hypotheses under controlled                           
              conditions.  I.A. Tamas will investigate mechanisms                            
              underlying the effects of indoleacetic acid (IAA) on plant                     
              morphogenesis using transgenic tobacco plants.  Dr. Tamas'                     
              work requires tissue culture under axenic conditions as well                   
              as the growth of transgenic whole tobacco plants.  B.P.                        
              Smith will investigate interactions between environmental                      
              factors, such as humidity and parasitism by mites, in                          
              determining mortality in populations of mosquitoes.  Dr.                       
              Smith's research requires close control of temperature,                        
              photoperiod, and humidity.
