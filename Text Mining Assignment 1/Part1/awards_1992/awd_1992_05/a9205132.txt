Abstract    :
              The 1991 eruption of Mt. Pinatubo is estimated to have produced                
              about 1 km3 of ashfall and 7 km3 of pyroclastic flows.  Much of                
              this volcaniclastic material remains metastably perched on the                 
              flanks of the edifice.  Massive lahars are expected to be generated            
              during the wet seasons of the next several years, and possibly of              
              the next decade.  Owing to the extraordinary thickness of                      
              accumulated pyroclastic debris, hot lahars are expected to occur               
              for the next one or two years.  This presents an invaluable                    
              opportunity to study how both hot and cold rain lahars are                     
              generated and how they behave, especially how they are different               
              from one another.  This project, therefore, is intended to:  (1)               
              closely coordinate scientific observation and documentation of                 
              lahars on the west side of the volcano; (2) update lahar-hazard                
              maps and transmit warnings when lahars are imminent; (3) train                 
              Filipino scientists to study lahars and their deposits; and (4)                
              develop educational materials to instruct scientists,                          
              decision-makers, and laymen in the Philippines and elsewhere.
