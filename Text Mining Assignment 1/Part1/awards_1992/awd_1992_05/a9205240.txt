Abstract    :
                   This project has four main objectives:  i) to identify                    
              efficient multiplier update implementations for large scale                    
              discrete-time control problems with state and control variable                 
              constraints, and for finite-difference approximations to                       
              analogous continuous-time problems;  ii) to extend existing                    
              convergence analyses to problems with inequality constraints that              
              have infinite-dimensional range spaces;  iii) to develop                       
              infinite-dimensional extensions of the Kuhn-Tucker sufficient                  
              conditions needed in convergence analyses for the subject                      
              algorithms and other constrained minimization methods as well;                 
              iv) to investigate quasi-Newton recursions that produce scaling                
              operators which automatically possess well-behaved global and                  
              asymptotic properties.                                                         
                   The algorithms investigated in this project are related to                
              significant applications in the operation of aircraft and                      
              spacecraft, electrical power networks, chemical and nuclear                    
              reactors, robot manipulators, and ecosystems.
