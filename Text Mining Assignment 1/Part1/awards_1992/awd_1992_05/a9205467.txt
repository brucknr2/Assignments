Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  The Fallen Leaf Lake Conferences initiated in 1985 is a                   
              bienneal event devoted to the molecular biology and genetics of                
              plant bacteria, fastidious prokaryotes, and related areas dealing              
              with these and other microorganisms.  The 1992 conference will be              
              on the molecular biology of bacterial virulence mechanisms.  The               
              Fallen Leaf Lake Conferences offer the special opportuity for                  
              participants to interact with experts in a particular field.  Only             
              the latest unpublished information is exchanged at the Fallen Leaf             
              Lake conference and ample opportunity for scientific interactions              
              is provided druing the course of the conference.  The conference is            
              attended by members representing most of the major laboratories                
              from many different countries (e.g., Europe, Asia, Africa,                     
              Australia, India) and therefore provides excellent opportunity for             
              graduate and postdoctoral students to interact with                            
              internationally recognized experts in a specific field.                        
              %%%                                                                            
                                                                                             
                   This Conference will provide a format for the exchange of                 
              ideas about pathogenic bacteria from a wide variety of systems.
