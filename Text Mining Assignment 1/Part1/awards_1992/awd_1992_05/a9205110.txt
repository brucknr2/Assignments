Abstract    :
                   Professor Efrat will work on several problems connected with              
              automorphic forms.  In particular, he will study the interplay                 
              between dynamical systems on the unit interval and zeta functions              
              attached to Riemann surfaces.  In particular, to explore                       
              consequences of the connection between zeta functions of modular               
              surfaces and the determinant of the transfer operator for the                  
              corresponding dynamical system.                                                
                   Automorphic forms arose out of Non-Euclidean geometry in the              
              middle of the nineteenth century.  Both mathematicians and                     
              physicists have thus long realized that many objects of                        
              fundamental importance are non-Euclidean in their basic nature.                
              This field is principally concerned with questions about the                   
              whole numbers, but in its use of geometry and analysis, it                     
              retains connection to its historical roots and thus to problems                
              in areas as diverse as gauge theory in theoretical physics and                 
              coding theory in information theory.
