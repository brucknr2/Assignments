Abstract    :
                     Theoretical models of mass transport to metamorphic terranes            
              present petrologic and stable isotopic criteria for recognizing the            
              passage of fluids through metamorphic rocks and may provide                    
              techniques for quantifying the pattern and extent of fluid flow.               
              This project will attempt to determine the scale and extent of                 
              fluid infiltration responsible for quartz veining and 18O depletions           
              in the Chugach metamorphic complex, Alaska.  This work will take               
              advantage of the recent mapping and structural work on these rocks             
              done by workers at Rice University.  Results should provide a more             
              realistic evaluation of the role of fluid flow in the thermal                  
              evolution of the Chugach terrane and by analogy to other similar               
              convergent arc-margins.
