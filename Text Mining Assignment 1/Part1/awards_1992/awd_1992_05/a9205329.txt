Abstract    :
              The Department of Chemistry at Mississippi State University                    
              will use this award from the Chemical Research Instrumentation                 
              Program to help acquire a medium-range computing facility.  The                
              areas of chemical research that will be enhanced by the                        
              acquisition include the following:  1. Theoretical Studies of                  
              Molecular Structure and Reactivity.  The proposed research                     
              includes software development, accurate ab initio studies of                   
              conformational problems and weak interactions, and                             
              semiempirical studies of solvation effects and large                           
              organometallic systems.  2. Surface Analysis.  Spectroscopic                   
              studies of chromatographic of surfaces will be augumented with                 
              molecular modeling calculations.  3. Conformational Analysis                   
              using NMR.  Molecular modeling calculations will be used to                    
              generate three-dimensional structures of vitamin B12                           
              derivatives and neuropeptides from NMR-data.                                   
              %%%                                                                            
              The computational demands of modern chemical research require                  
              the proper computing system that would avoid wasteful                          
              bottlenecks by balancing a variety of computational                            
              capabilities with individual workstations, networks, hardware                  
              and software maintenance, support personnel and training in all                
              areas of computational chemistry.  Many new insights into                      
              kinetics of chemical reactions can be developed through                        
              theoretical studies with use of mini supercomputers when the                   
              experimental data are inaccessible.
