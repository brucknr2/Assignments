Abstract    :
              In this project the principal investigator will measure and                    
              interpret distributions of chlorofluorocarbons (CFC's or Freons),              
              F-11 and F-12, in the Pacific Ocean on hydrographic sections along             
              179|E and 149|E, designated by the World Ocean Circulation                     
              Experiment (WOCE) as P-14N and P-10, respectively.  A principal                
              focus would be on the ventilation and circulation of North Pacific             
              Intermediate Water and Subtropical Mode Water.  Also to be                     
              addressed are inter-gyre exchange and cross-equatorial exchange.               
              CFC measurements have not been made in these regions before, and               
              are integral to WOCE Hydrographic planning.
