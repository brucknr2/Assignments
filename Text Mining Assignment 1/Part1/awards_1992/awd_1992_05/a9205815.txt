Abstract    :
                   The reconstruction of Precambrian cratons and supercontinents             
              and their breakup relies on well-constrained paleomagnetic data.               
              Africa has an extensive and complex Precambrian shield, and                    
              considerable data exists.  This project will obtain a number of key            
              paleomagnetic poles from the Tanzanian Craton of east Africa that              
              will allow testing of several conflicting hypotheses regarding                 
              tectonic processes during the Proterozoic, including the make up               
              and timing of assembly of a  Proterozoic supercontinent and whether            
              the mobile belts surrounding cratons originated by ensialic or                 
              ensimatic sources.  Results should provide comparative data useful             
              in other Precambrian shields.
