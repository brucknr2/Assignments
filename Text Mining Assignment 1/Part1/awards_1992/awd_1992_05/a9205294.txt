Abstract    :
                   The Department of Mathematics at the Florida State                        
              University will purchase a Silicon Graphics IRIS 4D/310VGX                     
              graphics supercomputer, which will be dedicated to the                         
              support of research in fluid dynamics, dynamical systems, and                  
              applications of geometry by members of the department.  The                    
              equipment will support high end graphics software needed                       
              for research on dynamics of galaxies, time dependent shock layer               
              flows, dynamics and structure of the earth's magnetic field, and               
              simulation of jet noise generation.  This research is being                    
              conducted by four mathematicians; Christopher Hunter, McKenizie                
              Professor of Mathematics; David Kopriva, David E. Loper, and                   
              Christopher K. W. Tam.
