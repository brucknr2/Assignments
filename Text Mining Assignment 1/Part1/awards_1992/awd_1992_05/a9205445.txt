Abstract    :
                   This award provides 73% of the costs of an instrument                     
              development project to design and build a high-pressure                        
              experimental system capable of exerting simultaneous conditions up             
              to 20 GPa and 1600K on cubic centimeter sized samples and measuring            
              their physical properties such as electrical conductivity,                     
              viscosity, and density. The University is committed to providing               
              the remaining funds necessary for this project. The high-pressure              
              system will be developed and installed in the Department of Geology            
              at Arizona State University and will be used in research                       
              investigating the geophysical properties of the Earth's mantle.
