Abstract    :
                   The nature of the deep pre-Mesozoic crust is unknown in a                 
              large part of the western U.S., yet knowledge of the buried crustal            
              rocks is critical to evaluating many of the existing tectonic                  
              models of the region.  This project will attempt to determine if               
              the pre-Mesozoic basement is a single, extensive arc terrane of                
              continental chemistry or is a collage of smaller terranes of more              
              oceanic composition by examination of volcanic and volicaniclastic             
              rocks of upper Paleozoic age that were derived form the basement.              
              Field relationships, ages and structures will be the focus of the              
              University of Nevada researchers; extensive geochemical analyses               
              will be the focus of the French collaborators, funded by the French            
              CNRS.  Results are expected to help resolve the nature of the pre-             
              Mesozoic basement and therefore clarify the starting material for              
              the major Mesozoic and Cenozoic tectonic events that affected the              
              area.
