Abstract    :
              The principal investigator will develop experimental methods for               
              the measurement of photoconductivity of selected insulating and                
              semiconducting minerals. The PI will then relate photoconductivity             
              spectra to energy level structure, and extract information on                  
              transport properties such as carrier densities and degree of                   
              delocalization of excited states. Ultimately he wishes to                      
              demonstrate the value of these spectra for interpretation of                   
              electronic and transport properties of minerals.
