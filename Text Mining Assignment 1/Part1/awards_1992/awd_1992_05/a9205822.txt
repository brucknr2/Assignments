Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Selected shape memory alloys are synthesized using electrochemical             
              deposition.  Three alloy systems are selected for the initial                  
              research, In-Ti, In-Cd, and In-Pb.  The structure and shape memory             
              transformation behavior are compared to conventionally-processed               
              alloys.  Layered shape memory Fe-Ni alloys are to be produced in a             
              modulated, nanolayer form using pulse plating.  Characterization               
              methods include X-ray diffraction, internal stress measurement,                
              scanning and transmission electron microscopy, and Auger                       
              spectroscopy.                                                                  
              %%%                                                                            
              Electrolysis offers potentially valuable synthesis capability,                 
              which has been improved with recent advances in technology.  Direct            
              deposition in the form of thin films or multilayer configurations              
              can be used to produce unique materials.
