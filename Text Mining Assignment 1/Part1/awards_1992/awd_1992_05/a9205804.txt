Abstract    :
              In order to understand the recycling behavior of subduction-related            
              fluids through forearc regions at convergent margins, and to better            
              understand the origins of volcanic rock types unique to forearc                
              regions, a study of B, Li, and 10/9Be systematics will be                      
              undertaken on suites of forearc lavas from Mexico, the Woodlark                
              Basin and from Panama, and on serpentinites emplaced diapirically              
              in the Marianas and Izu forearcs.  Analyses for B, Be, and Li will             
              be conducted by IC plasma spectrometry at Florida International                
              University, while 10Be measurements will be made at the Department             
              of Terrestrial Magnetism.  Measurements of B and 10Be, unquivocal              
              indicators of a subducted origin, will aid in identifying the                  
              sources of serpentinizing fluids in the Izu and Marianas and the               
              magnitude of these fluid fluxes through the forearc.  As in island             
              arc volcanic rocks, measurements of light elements in forearc                  
              volcanics will allow us to identify and quantify the effects of                
              subducted components, as well as to define the method by which                 
              trace elements are transported from the slab into lavas.  Light                
              element data from forearcs will be compared and combined with the              
              existent database on arc volcanic rock in order to create a                    
              detailed model for the chemical cycle of fluids in subduction                  
              zones.
