Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This study considers the impact of beaver on the behavior of the               
              element phosphorus in streams.  Historical records indicate that               
              beaver probably inhabited most of the small streams in North                   
              America prior to settlement by Europeans.  The river flow on these             
              streams was likely impeded by a series of beaver dams, resulting               
              in ponds separated by the stream channels.  Harvesting of beaver               
              led to their near extinction around 1900, but laws protecting them             
              have led to their rapid recovery.  It is therefore important to                
              understand the influence of beaver on streams because their                    
              presence characterizes the past and perhaps future status of                   
              streams.  The influence of beaver activity on phosphorus dynamics              
              in streams has not been fully studied.  It is important that these             
              studies be done because phosphorus is an element which often                   
              limits the growth and metabolism of aquatic organisms.  If the                 
              concentration of this element in water is changed by the presence              
              of beaver dams, then downstream reaches will be altered.  This                 
              study will determine if beaver dams change the phosphorus                      
              concentration in downstream water and what factors (particularly               
              those associated with sediments) influence the behavior of                     
              phosphorus and its relation to decomposition processes.
