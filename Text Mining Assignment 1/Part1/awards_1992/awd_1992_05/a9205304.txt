Abstract    :
              The Department of Mathematics and the Center for Applied                       
              Mathematics and Statistics at the New Jersey Institute of                      
              Technology will purchase a graphics workstation with a memory                  
              upgrade, mass storage devices, and a printer which will be                     
              dedicated to support faculty and students research in the                      
              mathematical and engineering sciences.  The equipment will be                  
              used in support of several projects, including in particular:                  
              1. Chaotic behavior of infinite-dimensional dynamical systems.                 
              2. Simulation of Stokes flow with moving boundaries.                           
              3. Discrete element modeling of vibrating granular beds.                       
              4. Automated cluster tracking in granular shear flows.
