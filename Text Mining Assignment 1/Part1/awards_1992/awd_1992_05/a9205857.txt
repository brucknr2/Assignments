Abstract    :
                   Most of what we know about the Earth's interior is based on               
              inferences from seismological observations.  Seismology places                 
              direct constraints on the isotropic elastic properties of the                  
              Earth's mantle.  The comparison of laboratory data with seismic                
              models of the Earth has led to much conjecture about the                       
              composition of the mantle.  Typically, the laboratory data on                  
              minerals is constrained to the bulk modulus and the density, while             
              measurements of the shear modulus remain very sparse, particularly             
              at high pressures.  The PI will measure the compressional wave                 
              velocities of several silicates in polycrystalline form, using                 
              Brillouin scattering and the diamond anvil cell.  From this data               
              and a knowledge of the bulk modulus and density of the material the            
              shear moduli at high pressures can be calculated using elementary              
              thermodynamics.  These data will allow us to take advantage of the             
              seismological information that is currently under-utilized, and                
              hopefully will place tighter constraints on the composition of the             
              Earth's mantle.
