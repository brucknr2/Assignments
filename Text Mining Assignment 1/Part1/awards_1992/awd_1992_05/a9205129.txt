Abstract    :
                   Professor Morales will study invariants associated to                     
              integral trace forms in normal tame finite extensions of number                
              fields.  He wants to see whether there are Stickelberger like                  
              conditions for classes associated to trace forms in fields of                  
              even degree.                                                                   
                   This project falls into the general area of arithmetic                    
              geometry - a subject that blends two of the oldest areas of                    
              mathematics:  number theory and geometry.  This combination has                
              proved extraordinarily fruitful - having recently solved problems              
              that withstood generations.  Among its many consequences are new               
              error correcting codes.  Such codes are essential for both modern              
              computers (hard disks) and compact disks.
