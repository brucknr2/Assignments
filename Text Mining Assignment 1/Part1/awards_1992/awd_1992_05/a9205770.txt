Abstract    :
                   This research addresses the integration of source coding,                 
              channel coding, and modulation.  The first part of the problem is              
              to map the samples of the source into a code that minimizes the                
              distortion and tries to maximize the minimum distance between                  
              code words.  The second part of the problem is to find a suitable              
              modulation scheme that is matched to the code and uses the                     
              bandwidth efficiently.  Performance measures that reflect the                  
              performance of an overall system are developed.  The performance               
              of combined source and channel code using permutation codes,                   
              which have been used independently for source coding and for                   
              channel coding, will be considered.  Initially permutation                     
              modulation is considered in the design and analysis of the                     
              combined system.  Next two approaches are considered for coded                 
              modulation: signal sets derived from generalized (optimal                      
              constant weight codes), and the use of combinatorial and                       
              geometric structures to generate signal sets enabling the                      
              realization of multi-dimensional modulation schemes through                    
              frequency, phase, and amplitude shift keying, or combinations.
