Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The regulation of maternal RNAs is critical to early development.              
              Dr. Kimble proposes to take a combined genetic and molecular                   
              approach to analyze maternal RNA controls in the nematode C.                   
              elegans. The fem-3 and glp-1 genes express maternal RNAs that                  
              regulate sex determination and inductive cell interactions in                  
              early embryos. Preliminary evidence suggests that the 3'                       
              untranslated regions of these RNAs regulate their activity at the              
              level of translation. Dr. Kimble proposes to address the                       
              mechanisms by which the fem-3 and glp-1 maternal RNAs are                      
              controlled in three ways. First, she will ask whether the fem-3                
              and glp-1 maternal RNAs are translationally controlled. To this                
              end, she will examine the distribution of their endogenous RNAs                
              and proteins and assess their association with polysomes. Second,              
              she will identify sequence elements necessary for regulation. To               
              this  end, she will inject reporter RNAs carrying wild-type and                
              mutant sequences from fem-3 or glp-1 into the germ line and assay              
              their translational capacity in oocytes and early embryos. Third,              
              she will begin to analyze factors that regulate maternal RNAs. To              
              this end, she will rely on gel shift assays and analysis of mog-1              
              mutants. An understanding of how maternal RNAs are regulated in                
              C. elegans will provide insight into this fundamental control of               
              early development and also will allow expression of specific                   
              proteins to be manipulated in early embryos.
