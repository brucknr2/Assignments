Abstract    :
                   The goal of the proposed research is to recover a detailed                
              record of Laurentide Ice Sheet fluctuations in southern Ohio during            
              the last glacial cycle to test climate-change hypotheses.  Multiple            
              (~150) radiocarbon ages from organic materials associated with                 
              glacial deposits of the Miami and Scioto sublobes will delineate               
              a high-resolution chronology (e.g. glacial phases dated to within              
              30014C years) and architecture of these ice marginal changes                   
              through the last glacial maximum.  This record by itself will                  
              clarify the behavior of southern sector of the huge Laurentide Ice             
              Sheet (a key component of the ice-age climate system).  It may also            
              be an important repository of climatic change.  If so, this basic              
              stratigraphic record will be the basis for tests between at least              
              two current hypotheses of ice-age climate.  The first suggest that             
              orbital changes drive ice sheets which in turn drive climate, thus             
              predicting specific leads and lags between ice sheet growth and                
              climate change.  The second view suggests that ice-age climate                 
              changes result from abrupt ocean-atmospheric reorganizations, thus             
              predicting widespread, synchronous changes across the global                   
              cryosphere-atmosphere-hydrosphere system.  For example, the second             
              hypothesis requires that glacial fluctuations in various parts of              
              the Northern Hemisphere will be in phase and that these in turn,               
              will be concurrent with glacial fluctuations in the Southern                   
              Hemisphere.  Present stratigraphic interpretations of southern                 
              Laurentide fluctuations in Ohio are inadequate to delineate ice-               
              sheet dynamics or test any climate theories because they have not              
              fully considered the genesis of glacial deposits and have only weak            
              (+2,00014C years) chronologic control.
