Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This research is concerned with developing inorganic monolayer by              
              incorporating arrays of inorganic ions and complexes into monolayer            
              assemblies formed by Langmuir-Blodgett and self-assembly                       
              techniques.  Organized organic monolayers will be used as templates            
              for forming inorganic layers.  Three classes of inorganic layers               
              are explored:  layered alkylammonium metal halides, metal halides              
              prepared on organic host, and layered metal phosphonates and                   
              phosphates.  The new materials will be characterized structurally,             
              and an investigation of their magnetic properties in two dimensions            
              will be conducted.  The proposed work has an ultimate potential for            
              developing high-density, reversible magnetic recording media.
