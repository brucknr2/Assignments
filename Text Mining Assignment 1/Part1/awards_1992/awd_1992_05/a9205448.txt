Abstract    :
                This research is to study the Andean foreland of northwestern                
              Argentina by means of reprocessing and interpretation of                       
              reflection seismic data collected by the State Oil Company (YPF)               
              of Argentina.  The reprocessing will improve the quality of the                
              reflection data at depths below those of primary interest in                   
              routine industry work.  These results will be combined with                    
              earthquake studies done using a portable seismic network                       
              installed for 9 months by Memphis State University.  The study is              
              currently in a compressional regime that has reactivated                       
              preexisting faults formed in extension.  The combination of the                
              two data sets will bear on the understanding of tectonics of the               
              Andean foreland, mountain building and earthquake hazard of the                
              region.  This research is a component of the National Earthquake               
              Hazard Reduction Program.
