Abstract    :
              The principal investigator will experimentally study aspects of                
              fluids and melts in a reduced mantle. In particular, he will work              
              on application of the sulfide oxybarometer to mantle phase                     
              assemblages, the determination of moissanite stability, the                    
              determination of CO solubility and speciation in sodium silicate               
              melt, and the determination of the solubility of certain mineral               
              assemblages in methane-bearing fluid at mantle pressures. All these            
              studies have bearing on the redox state of the mantle at present               
              and in the past, and on the development of the Earth as a whole                
              over time.
