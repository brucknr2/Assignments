Abstract    :
              The principal investigator will study crystal-melt reaction                    
              products common in many hybrid rocks, and he will apply the results            
              to two volcanic systems in an attempt to explain where-how-when                
              magma mixing occurred. In general, this work will be useful in                 
              unraveling the mixing histories of both plutonic and volcanic                  
              igneous rocks.
