Abstract    :
              This project is to continue study of ultramafic xenoliths from the             
              Samoan hotspot chain.  Previous work has demonstrated very high                
              noble gas concentrations in the xenoliths, and at least some of                
              them have highly elevated 3He/4He ratios (to 22 RA) and non-                   
              atmospheric heavy rare gases.  Continued studies of xenoliths from             
              throughout Samoa will provide an important test of the tentative               
              conclusions reached, based on analyses of xenoliths from just two              
              localities.  In addition, individual crystals will be analyzed by              
              laser fusion to characterize small-scale noble gas heterogeneity               
              within the xenoliths.  To more fully understand the significance               
              of the rare gas results the PIs plan to study the gross chemical               
              composition and the filling pressures of the fluid inclusions in               
              which rare gases reside.
