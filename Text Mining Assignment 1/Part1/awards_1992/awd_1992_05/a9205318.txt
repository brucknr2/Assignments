Abstract    :
              The principal investigator will study the Galeras Volcanic Complex,            
              Columbia, utilizing geologic/petrologic/isotopic techniques. He                
              will attempt to understand this volcanic complex in the context of             
              other volcanoes in the region. He will attempt to understand the               
              functioning of the present volcanic center; this will have import-             
              ant scientific consequences, as well as important consequences for             
              residents threatened by the volcano. The PI will investigate                   
              degassing and associated seismicity, the amount and source of                  
              released volatiles, and he will address eruption forecasting for               
              this region.
