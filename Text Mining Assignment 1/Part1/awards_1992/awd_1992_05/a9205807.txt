Abstract    :
              This proposal is for geologic and geochemical investigations into              
              the origin of alkaline and peralkaline magmatism.  The PIs propose             
              to extend their chemical investigations of volcanic rocks from the             
              islands and from submarine topographic highs in the region to                  
              include detailed trace element analyses by INAA and isotopic                   
              analyses of O and Pb.  The PIs will also continue Ar geochronology             
              of the Socorro Island in order to quantify thermochemical fluxes               
              to the island.  By establishing the eruptive history and effects               
              of contamination, it will be possible to more quantitatively                   
              document the nature and thermal evolution of magmatic processes                
              that lead to the production of salic peralkaline magmas.
