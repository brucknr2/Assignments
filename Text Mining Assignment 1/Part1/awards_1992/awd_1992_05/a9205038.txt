Abstract    :
                   This project deals with three related problems in the                     
              general area of image processing.  The first is a dramatic                     
              increase in the efficiency of the Gibbs Sampler and Metropolis                 
              Dynamic algorithms from restricting the algorithms to a locally                
              bounded image space.  The second develops a special estimation                 
              method for astronomical image data of a faint disk, where the                  
              data has significant blur (e.g., Hubble telescope data).  Here                 
              the use of a suitable lower dimensional linear function improves               
              efficiency. The third addresses data compression using a Markov                
              random field model and subdividing the original large image and                
              forming optimal representative subimages.                                      
                   Statistical image analysis uses statistical principles to                 
              "guess" the real image when only poor quality image data is                    
              available.  The quality of a particular algorithm is depends upon              
              how good the chosen "guess" is and how quickly it is achieved.                 
              This project focusses on increasing the speed of the algorithms                
              by trying to get the most pertinent information rather than                    
              working on the whole image at once.
