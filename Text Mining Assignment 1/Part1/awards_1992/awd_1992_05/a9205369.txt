Abstract    :
                This research is to extend the study of earthquake fault                     
              rupture surfaces to higher frequency radiation, above 3 hertz.                 
              In this range, waveform inversion has proven impractical due to                
              earth's complexities and a procedure has been developed using                  
              seismic wave energy envelopes.  The technique locates high                     
              frequency energy sources on extended faults by means of strong                 
              motion seismograms.  Preliminary results indicate that the high                
              frequency energy sources are located along or near the boundaries              
              of large slip zones.  This supports the hypothesis that high                   
              frequencies are most strongly generated from rupture stopping                  
              areas or areas with large slip variation, which has implications               
              for earthquake hazard estimates.  The current work will extend                 
              the analysis to more earthquakes.  This research is a component                
              of the National Earthquake Hazard Reduction Program.
