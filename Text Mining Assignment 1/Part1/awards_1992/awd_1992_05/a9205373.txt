Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This project involves the study of a sample of children in                     
              Dominica.  The project builds on long-term research on variations              
              in corticosteroid stress response and socio-cultural variables.                
              Using randomized scan sampling techniques as well as standard                  
              participant observation and interviews with family members, the                
              project will assess the behavioral correlates to biochemical                   
              variation in hormonal assays related to stress in a sample of 126              
              children.                                                                      
                                                                                             
              This sort of research is important because the many studies of                 
              the causes of children's stress have not examined biochemical                  
              variables as they vary with micro-level differences in family                  
              composition and interaction styles.  This project will generate                
              data that will be useful in advancing our understanding of the                 
              causes of childhood stress.
