Abstract    :
              This project is to study how pyroclastic flows cross high mountains            
              (>1000m):  whether (1) they are expanded flows and segregate into              
              different parts, or (2) non-expanded flows with high momentum that             
              move over mountains as they do on flat ground.  Understanding how              
              flow mechanisms influence runout length and elevations a flow can              
              surmount has major consequences for hazard assessments.  The Ito               
              ignimbrite is ideal to study:  it (1) crosses high mountains, (2)              
              is well exposed and extensive, and (3) access is easy.  Flow                   
              direction differences, critical for recognition of the different               
              flow models, will be measured by standard geologic methods (facies             
              analysis, distribution of maximum fragment sizes, fabric analysis)             
              and by anisotropy of magnetic susceptibility.  Results should not              
              only provide a better scientific understanding of pyroclastic flow             
              movement, but could also trigger administrative action directly                
              related to saving human lives.
