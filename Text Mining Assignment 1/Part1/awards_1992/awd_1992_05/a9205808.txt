Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This proposal is intended to initiate a research program to study              
              cell signalling during Drosophila development. The wealth of                   
              genetic information and the ease of molecular manipulation in                  
              Drosophila make it an ideal system for the dissection of                       
              processes involving many components, such as signal transduction               
              pathways. Here Dr. Wharton proposes to elucidate the function of               
              the newly identified TGF-beta like gene, 60A, through genetical                
              and developmental analyses. Mutations in the gene will be                      
              generated in an F2 lethal screen and a male sterile screen. The                
              developmental consequences of these mutants will be determined by              
              direct observation of their development, cuticular preparations,               
              histology and in situ hybridizations. Potential genetic                        
              interactions involving 60A, and other genes which code for                     
              putative components of a TGF-beta signal transduction pathway,                 
              such as, a second Drosophila TGF-beta like gene, dpp, will be                  
              examined. The results of these experiments will allow us to                    
              better understand the roles of TGF-beta like proteins in                       
              communication between cells during development.
