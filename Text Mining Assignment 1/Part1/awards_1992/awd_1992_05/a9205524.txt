Abstract    :
              This research is an investigation of the petrologic, major and                 
              trace element characteristics of recent volcanic rocks, basement               
              rocks and xenoliths from the region of Osorno and Calbuco                      
              volcanoes, 41o-41o45' S, Chile.  The objective of the research is              
              to determine the role of the continental crust in influencing the              
              composition of magmas erupted at the two stratovolcanoes and a                 
              chain of small monogenetic eruptive centers (MEC) that are aligned             
              along the Liquine-Ofqui Fault Zone, a major crustal fracture.  A               
              specific goal is to distinguish the importance of contrast in                  
              crustal composition versus the absolute extent of assimilation in              
              influencing magma composition.  Individual projects to be carried              
              out are:  1) the analysis of volcanic rocks for major and trace                
              elements by ICPES, 2) collection and analysis of Paleozoic basement            
              rocks, including mineral analysis by electron microprobe, and 3)               
              mineral analysis of granulite crustal xenoliths collected                      
              previously.  These data will help to develop quantitative models               
              for the evolution of magma in this region.
