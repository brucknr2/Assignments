Abstract    :
                     This study will combine stratigraphic and structural mapping            
              and palynological analyses to obtain the detailed movement history             
              of individual thrusts in the Sevier orogenic belt of central Utah.             
              Timing of the inception of the Sevier thrusts is presently                     
              unconstrained.  Conglomeratic sediments were deformed                          
              syndespostionally by thrusts, and these conglomeratic rocks can be             
              traced laterally into pollen-bearing fine-grained sedimentary                  
              rocks.  Thus the timing of thrust inception can be obtained.  The              
              results of this study will improve our understanding of the early              
              stages of thrust belt development in the Sevier orogen, and also               
              in other tectonic environments.
