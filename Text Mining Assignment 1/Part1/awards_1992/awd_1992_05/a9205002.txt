Abstract    :
                   How is morphospace filled during a radiation and are there                
              rules for diversification?  We compare patterns of morphospace                 
              occupation and species longevity between three radiations of                   
              planktonic foraminifera to determine the predictability of these               
              patterns.  First we ask whether shape groups are discrete entities             
              in foraminifera.  Then we examine the extent to which shape                    
              membership predicts species longevity in each of the major                     
              radiations of this group.  Finally, we investigate how morphospace             
              is filled during the radiations and compare each cycle of                      
              diversification with the others to detect common patterns.  The                
              strengths of this study lie in our ability to compare                          
              macroevolutionary patterns between radiations to determine the                 
              stability and objectivity of these patterns.  In so doing, we can              
              determine whether bauplan diversity is regulated more by events                
              particular to each radiation or by long-term processes that change             
              little between evolutionary cycles.
