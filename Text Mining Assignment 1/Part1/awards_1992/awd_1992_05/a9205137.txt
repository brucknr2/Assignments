Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Since the beginning of the industrial revolution the CO2                       
              concentration in the atmosphere has risen by approximately 25%,                
              from 280 ppmv to 350 ppmv.  Current climate models estimate that               
              even if man-made emissions of CO2 could be kept at present rates,              
              atmospheric CO2 would increase to about 450 ppmv by the year 2050,             
              and to about 520 ppmv by the year 2100 (IPCC 1990).  These                     
              increases in atmospheric CO2 concentration, combined with                      
              increases in the concentrations of other greenhouse gases such as              
              methane and nitrous oxide, are predicted to lead to global climate             
              change comprised of higher temperatures and changes in the                     
              hydrological cycle.  How will simultaneous changes of CO2                      
              concentration and climate affect linked plant and soil processes?              
              This is one of today's critical environmental questions.                       
                                                                                             
              The U.S. National Committee of SCOPE (Scientific Committee on                  
              Problems of the Environment) will hold a workshop on linked                    
              vegetation and soil responses to increasing CO2 and climate                    
              change.  The goals of the Workshop are:                                        
                                                                                             
              1)    To coalesce current understanding of CO2 and climate change              
                    effects on linked vegetation and soil systems, both natural              
                    and managed.                                                             
                                                                                             
              2)    To evaluate our ability to predict responses of both natural             
                    ecosystems and agroecosystems to simultaneous changes in CO2             
                    and climate.                                                             
                                                                                             
              Contributions from agronomists, ecologists, plant physiologists,               
              and soil scientists will be needed to accomplish these goals.                  
              Both experimentalists and modeler will be invited because a                    
              crucial aim of the workshop is to improve communication between                
              those scientists conducting laboratory and field research on                   
              increasing CO2 and land use and those scientists who are                       
              projecting the potential effects of changing atmosphere and                    
              climate on ecosystems through the use of models.
