Abstract    :
                   A multi-institutional effort is proposed to obtain space-time             
              series of regional hydrological quantities reflecting climatic                 
              change scenarios.  The geographical areas to be investigated cover             
              central Arizona and the lower Platte river basin of Nebraska.  The             
              approach is based on an analysis of the occurrence, persistence and            
              transition probabilities of atmospheric circulation patterns.                  
              These patterns are defined daily as pressure surfaces using                    
              available and reliable data.  The proposed research consists of                
              three phases.  In the first phase, a classification of circulation             
              patterns will be sought; each type of pattern is then related in               
              a conditional framework to local space-time precipitation, runoff,             
              temperature, and wind.  Temperature and wind are used to define                
              regional drought indices.  Precipitation will be transformed into              
              runoff using relatively simple watershed models.  In the second                
              phase of the research, available GCM outputs are used to define                
              scenarios of possible daily time series of circulation                         
              precipitation, runoff, temperature, and regional droughts.                     
              Finally, the historical series of regional hydrologic events can               
              be compared to the various scenario predictions.  In the third                 
              phase of the research, the consequence of climatic change will be              
              analyzed by taking the example of the Great Salt Lake in Utah.
