Abstract    :
              A number of research projects in the Department of                             
              Biochemistry and Biophysics, Oregon State University, depend                   
              on the use of  analytical sedimentation methods.  These                        
              include studies of the structure, stability, and assembly of                   
              chromatin (K.E. van Holde): studies of the structure,                          
              evolution, and function of hemocyanins (K.I. Miller, K.E.                      
              van Holde): investigators of association between enzymes                       
              involved in protein phosphorylation (S.R. Anderson); and                       
              multi-enzyme complexes involved in biosynthesis of DNA                         
              precursors (C.K. Mathews).  The laboratory of Dr. van Holde                    
              has maintained, and steadily used for many years a Beckman                     
              Model E. analytical ultracentrifuge.  This instrument is                       
              both obsolete and decrepit.  Fortunately for our future                        
              research,  the Beckman Instrument Company has just come out                    
              with a radically new analytical ultracentrifuge design.                        
              This instrument will not only meet the present needs of our                    
              department, but will allow kinds of experiments hitherto                       
              impossible.  This proposal requests funds for such an                          
              instrument.  As a group that has been a leader in the                          
              utilization and development of ultracentrifuge techniques,                     
              we are in a position to make maximum use of such a facility.
