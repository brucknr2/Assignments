Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This project supports the continuation of the dissertation                     
              research of an anthropology student from Yale University in                    
              Tanzania, Africa.  The project studies the interrelations between              
              pastoralists, foragers, and the local fauna.  The student will                 
              study subsistence strategies in a marginal environment by                      
              analyzing how local people perceive shortages in resources and                 
              how these perceptions affect their decisions and behavior.  Using              
              a combination of methods including participant observation,                    
              intensive interviewing, surveys of human and non-human behavior                
              and data from remote sensing, the project will test the                        
              hypotheses that risk avoidance is the primary cognitive factor                 
              affecting decisions, while labor shortage is the primary socio-                
              economic factor constraining production.                                       
                                                                                             
              This research is important because human responses to harsh                    
              environmental constraints must be understood if policies to                    
              ameliorate human suffering and develop local economic and                      
              ecological systems are to be successful.
