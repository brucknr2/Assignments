Abstract    :
              The principal investigator will experimentally study phase                     
              equilibria involving volatiles under conditions relavant to the                
              Earth's mantle. The results will be used to model the development              
              of the oxidation state of the mantle during melting events. It will            
              also lead to a greatly improved understanding of the state of                  
              volatiles in the mantle.
