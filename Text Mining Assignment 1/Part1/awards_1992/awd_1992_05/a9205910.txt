Abstract    :
              In this project, the PI will collaborate with PI's from two other              
              institutions to carry out measurements of Chlorofluorocarbons                  
              (CFC's), F-11 and F-12, from water samples collected on three                  
              separate legs of a hydrographic cruise along 32|S in the Pacific               
              from Chile to Australia as part of the World Ocean Circulation                 
              Experiment (WOCE) Hydrographic Program (WHP).  This line is                    
              referred as WOCE line P-6.  This particular project will focus                 
              specifically on the central portion between Easter Island and New              
              Zealand.  Data will be used to study ventilation and circulation               
              of the upper water column, especially the Antarctic Intermediate               
              Water.  This work will also provide calibration of gas phase F-11              
              and F-12 standards used by all CFC laboratories for the WHP.
