Abstract    :
              Theoretical research will be undertaken on preroughening and                   
              reconstruction transitions in crystal surfaces, and the connection             
              between this and valence bond phases in quantum spin systems.  The             
              emergence of the first experimental evidence for preroughening                 
              opens up an array of important theoretical questions.  For                     
              instance, what is the influence of the interplay between                       
              preroughening and reconstruction in certain facets of face centered            
              cubic crystals; what about the roughness of disordered flat phases             
              during growth.  Roughening induced deconstruction transitions have             
              a chiral character and are governed by a new discrete invariance               
              related to super symmetry.                                                     
              %%%                                                                            
              The study of surfaces, and the transitions which take place on                 
              them, is of fundamental importance and has many technological                  
              applications.  The proposed research deals with studies of novel               
              phase transitions on surfaces and their relationship to more exotic            
              types of interacting systems.
