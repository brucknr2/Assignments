Abstract    :
                   This research will examine the global extinction of the                   
              Inoceramidae.  The work will focus on the stratigraphic                        
              distribution of both clam fragments in deep sea cores and body                 
              fossils from land based sections.  In addition, sedimentological               
              observations will be used to try to constrain possible forcing                 
              mechanisms for the extinction.  The major pulse of the Inoceramidae            
              extinction seems to have occurred at least two million years prior             
              to the K/T boundary event.  This work, thus, should provide                    
              information regarding ecological conditions prior to an event which            
              resulted in the extinction of over 50% of all species on earth.
