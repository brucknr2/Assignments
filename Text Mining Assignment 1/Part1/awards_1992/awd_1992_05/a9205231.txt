Abstract    :
                   This award supports the research of Professor N. Bergeron to              
              work in combinatorics.  He intends to investigate descent algebras             
              of finite Coxeter groups with a view to results about cyclic                   
              homology, Schubert polynomials with a view to proving Stanley's                
              conjecture and graded modules of harmonic polynomials to see how               
              they are related to the Macdonald polynomials.                                 
                   The research is in the general area of combinatorics.                     
              Combinatorics attempts to find efficient methods to study how                  
              discrete collections of objects can be organized.  And, so it is               
              extremely important to modern communications, for example the                  
              design of large networks as in telephone systems and the design of             
              algorithms in computer science.
