Abstract    :
                   The principal cause of the severe limitations of                          
              paleointensity data sets is the extreme difficulty of obtaining                
              reliable results.  Not only are the measurements time consuming,               
              but the success rate is relatively low, despite great care in                  
              sample selection.  One requires, a material possessing a thermal               
              remanence, that has not altered since its acquisition and does not             
              alter during the experiments.  Furthermore, the material should                
              have cooled at a rate reproducible in the laboratory, and should               
              be datable with a relative precision of a few percent.  Basaltic               
              glass has been recovered from hundreds of Deep Sea Drilling Program            
              holes from anomalies of known age.  Glass is quenched at formation             
              and the rate of cooling can be well approximated in the laboratory.            
              It can be inspected for alteration and shown that it does not                  
              readily alter during the Thellier experiment.  Finally, basaltic               
              glass derived from MORB appears to contain single domain low-Ti                
              magnetite.  Shards can be found that have sufficient moments to be             
              readily measured with our equipment; such shards obtained from 0               
              and 2640 year eruptions of the East Pacific Rise have yielded                  
              excellent paleointensity data and similar quality data can be                  
              obtained from other basaltic glass regardless of age.  The PI will             
              carry out a paleointensity study of basaltic glasses.
