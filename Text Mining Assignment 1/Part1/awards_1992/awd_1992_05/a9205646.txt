Abstract    :
              9205646  Kesler  This is a study of several important features of greenstone 
              gold deposits, the largest hypogene gold deposits in the  world.  Research will
              be on the Porcupine district, Ontario,  where high-grade gold ore is well
              developed and where we  have collected over 400 barren veins from an area of
              2000  km2 surrounding the deposits.  Work will involve study of  the structural
              setting of high-grade ore, fluid inclusion  petrography and microthermometry of
              ore and barren veins,  and inclusion gas, stable isotope and radiogenic isotope
               analyses of barren and high-grade veins.  The research will  include analysis
              of inclusions in gold and related minerals,  and an attempt to obtain isotopic
              ages on minerals from  different pasts of sheeted veins to determine the period
               over which the deposits formed.  The results are expected to  provide insights
              into the source of the gold-forming fluid  and its relation to the evolution of
              Archean greenstone  terrains, as well as structural and geochemical parameters 
              that could guide exploration for these deposits.
