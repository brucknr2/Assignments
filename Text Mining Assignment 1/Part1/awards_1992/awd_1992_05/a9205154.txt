Abstract    :
                   The principal investigator will continue his investigation                
              of deformation problems in geometry and algebra by developing a                
              principle of Deligne. The methods include techniques from                      
              differential geometry and rational homotopy theory.                            
                   This award will support research in the general area of                   
              differential geometry and global analysis. Differential geometry               
              is the study of the relationship between the geometry of a space               
              and analytic concepts defined on the space. Global analysis is                 
              the study of the overall geometric and topological properties of               
              a space by piecing together local information. Applications of                 
              these areas of mathematics in other sciences include the                       
              structure of complicated molecules, liquid-gas boundaries, and                 
              the large scale structure of the universe.
