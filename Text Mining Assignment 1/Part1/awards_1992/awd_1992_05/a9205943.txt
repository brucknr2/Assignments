Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              In early development in the frog Xenopus laevis depends entirely               
              on materials stored in the full grown oocyte. Embryonic gap                    
              junctions channels, or connexins, are oligomers of one or more of              
              the oocyte connexin proteins. Dr. Gimlich proposes to                          
              specifically eliminate each connexin by ablating its mRNA in the               
              oocyte to determine its functional contribution to embryonic                   
              channels. The consequences of connexin deficiency will be                      
              assessed by electrophysiological methods, with a major goal being              
              to eliminate gap junction channels between embryonic cells.                    
              Several treatments, including improper expression of certain                   
              growth factors and proto-oncogene products, result in development              
              of enhanced or duplicated dorsal, axial structures. These                      
              perturbations also lead to region specific increase in the number              
              of functional gap junctions. The meaning of this correlation will              
              be tested by experimental manipulation of the number of gap                    
              junction channels. The experiments will yield information on the               
              physiological role of junctional channels during blastula stages               
              of development, when the pattern of cell fates is laid out in the              
              embryo through a series of cellular interactions involving                     
              signals that may be transduced by gap junction permeable second                
              messengers.
