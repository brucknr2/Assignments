Abstract    :
              Diurnal carbohydrate reserves provide leaves with carbon for export            
              at night and during times of low photosynthesis, thereby                       
              maintaining an uninterrupted supply of carbon to non-                          
              photosynthesizing plant structures for growth, storage and                     
              metabolism.  In some plants, like sugar beet and soybean, the                  
              diurnal reserve takes the form of starch, while in other plants,               
              like fava bean and spinach, sucrose accumulates.  The objectives of            
              our program are to identify systematically (1) how carbon                      
              apportionment to sucrose and starch and of export together are                 
              regulated in a way that furnishes a diurnal carbohydrate reserve to            
              leaves and regulates the current rate of export throughout the day-            
              night cycle and (2) how photosynthetic carbon assimilation, carbon             
              allocation and export interact when export is restricted or                    
              photosynthesis is increased, both in plants that accumulate sucrose            
              and those that do not.  We will measure changes in export rates,               
              enzyme activities and metabolite levels in leaves of the two types             
              of plants when carbon allocation is changed by extending the day or            
              shortening the previous night.  The ways in which restricting                  
              export by chilling-induced slowing of metabolism in the receiving              
              organs or of increasing photosynthesis by raising CO2 affects                  
              photosynthesis and carbohydrate accumulation will be compared in               
              sucrose-storing and starch storing plants.
