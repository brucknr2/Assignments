Abstract    :
                     The Cheyenne belt of southeastern Wyoming separates the                 
              Archean Wyoming Province from accreted island-arc rocks of the                 
              Proterozoic Colorado Province.  Along the suture, several parallel             
              mylonite zones separate high grade, reactivated Archean crust north            
              of the main fault zone.  This project will focus on the development            
              of this reactivated crust and will involve mapping, age dating and             
              geochemical analysis.  Results will help understand the details of             
              the collision zone between the Archean Wyoming Province and the                
              Proterozoic Colorado Province and may also provide insight into                
              the deep-seated structural character of the root zone of a basement            
              uplift in the external zone of a major collisional belt.
