Abstract    :
              Informational suppression can be central to genetic analysis and               
              gene manipulation.  Suppressor-tRNA mutations may be used to define            
              selectable markers for transformation experiments.  Suppression of             
              chloroplast gene was first observed in Chlamydamons reinhardtii by             
              this laboratory.  The photosynthetic mutants which were suppressed             
              were found to be heteroplastic and it was proposed that a balanced             
              polymorphism of suppressor and wild type alleles of a tRNA gene                
              resulted in the heteroplasmicity.  The hypothesized mechanism is               
              unique and this study continues the characterization of the system.            
              The objectives are to determine the nature of the tRNAs involved               
              and determine the frequency and diversity of heteroplastic                     
              suppression.                                                                   
              %%%                                                                            
              Much has been learned of the physical structure of the chloroplast             
              genome but little is know of the basic genetic mechanisms utilized             
              by this organelle.  C. reinhardtii is still the only green                     
              organisms in which routine genetic analysis of this chloroplast is             
              possible and the information resulting from this study could have              
              important economic ramifications.
