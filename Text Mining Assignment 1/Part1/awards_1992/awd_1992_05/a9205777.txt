Abstract    :
                This research is to continue analysis of seismic data from a                 
              digital network that has been operating around the Sumatran fault              
              in northern Sumatra (near Lake Toba) since November, 1990.  These              
              data offer the first detailed look at the Sumatran fault.  The                 
              study will use the arrival time data, waveforms, earthquake                    
              locations, and fault plane solutions to answer questions about                 
              earthquake distribution and focal mechanisms in relation to the                
              geological structures in the region.  This work is being done in               
              cooperation with the Indonesian Meteorological and Geophysical                 
              Agency (Jakarta) who operate the seismographic networks in                     
              Indonesia.  This research is a component of the National                       
              Earthquake Hazard Reduction Program.
