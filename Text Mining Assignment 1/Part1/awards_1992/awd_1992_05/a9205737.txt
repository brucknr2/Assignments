Abstract    :
              Massively parallel computers show promise in several computational             
              areas.  In this project a commercial massively parallel computer               
              is being used for several large-scale computational problems,                  
              including the architectural simulation of the P3, a proposed                   
              experimental massively parallel computer.  Other applications of               
              the commercial machine come from physics, chemistry, and discrete              
              mathematics.
