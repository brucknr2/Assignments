Abstract    :
              With the support of the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and                            
              Organometallic Chemistry Program, Dr. D. Michael Heinekey of                   
              the University of Washington will continue his investigations                  
              of a new quantum mechanical process involving pairwise                         
              tunnelling of protons at high temperatures in certain                          
              transition metal polyhydride complexes.  This proceess leads to                
              exceptionally large proton-proton coupling constants in the                    
              nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra of these complexes.                   
              The scope of this novel phenomenon will be defined by the                      
              synthesis of additional polyhydride complexes with different                   
              transition metals and a variety of ligands in addition to                      
              hydrogen.  The detailed mechanism of the tunnelling process                    
              will be investigated using inelastic neutron scattering,                       
              structure determination by neutron diffraction, and NMR                        
              spectroscopy, with particular emphasis on tritium NMR                          
              spectroscopy.                                                                  
              %%%                                                                            
              Pairs of hydrogen atoms in certain organometallic hydrides                     
              exchange positions without breaking the metal-hydrogen bonds.                  
              Organometallic hydrides constitute an important class of                       
              industrial catalysts, and this project is expected to help                     
              provide a better understanding of the mechanism of catalytic                   
              action.
