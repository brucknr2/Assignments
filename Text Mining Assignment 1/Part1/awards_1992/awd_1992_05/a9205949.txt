Abstract    :
              Professor William Jorgensen is supported by a grant from the                   
              Theoretical and Computational Chemistry Program to study                       
              organic reactions and host/guest chemistry in solution.  Ab                    
              initio quantum mechanical calculations will be performed to                    
              obtain minimum energy reaction paths in the gas phase as                       
              well as energetic and structural data on gas-phase complexes                   
              that contribute to the development of solute-solvent                           
              intermolecular potential functions.  Solvent effects will be                   
              examined through Monte Carlo statistical mechanics                             
              simulations for the reactions in solution.  Diels-Alder                        
              reactions with various dienophiles and under high pressure                     
              conditions as well as Claisen rearrangement reactions will                     
              be studied.  Host/guest interactions will also be studied in                   
              an effort to compute the relative and absolute free energies                   
              of binding in solution.                                                        
              %%%                                                                            
              Most important chemical reactions take place in solution,                      
              yet most of the theoretical knowledge regarding the                            
              molecular details of chemical reactions has been obtained                      
              for reactions in the gas phase.  Professor Jorgensen's                         
              theoretical research deals with the effects of solvation on                    
              important synthetic organic reactions.  He is using                            
              statistical mechanics and computer simulations to study the                    
              effects which various solvents have on the rates of these                      
              reactions.
