Abstract    :
              This research will further characterize essential genes that are               
              required for bacterial nucleoid partitioning.  Partitioning                    
              defective mutants within the S. typhimurium temperature sensitive              
              lethal collection have been identified, and preliminary data                   
              documents the "Par" phenotype.  Genetic data show's that most of               
              these new par mutations lie in genes other than parA-through-parF,             
              the known Par genes.  Experiments are genetically and molecularly              
              characterizing, these new par genes.  The genes will be mapped,                
              complementing clones will be isolated, and to the extent necessary             
              to provide new information, the genes sequenced.  Interactions                 
              between the Par proteins will be sought by suppressor analysis.                
              %%%                                                                            
              Faithful partitioning ensures that bacteria contain single copies              
              of their genes.  The process works without microtubules or any                 
              apparent analog, suggesting that an entirely novel mechanism                   
              accomplishes faithful bacterial DNA segregation.  As such, this                
              process may provide new targets for antibacterial drug design.  The            
              comparison of prokaryotic, eukaryotic and archebacterial DNA                   
              partitioning, will suggest whether these fundamental processes                 
              arose after the separation of the primary kingdoms.
