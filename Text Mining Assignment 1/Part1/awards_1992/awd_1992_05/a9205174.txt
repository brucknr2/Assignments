Abstract    :
              Heme is a cofactor, present in many compartments of the plant call.            
              While the plastid contains all of the enzymes requried for its own             
              heme synthesis, the role of other compartments, such as the                    
              mitochondrion and cytoplasm, in heme synthesis is unknown.  In this            
              project we will determine the location of four heme-synthetic                  
              enzymes (uroporphyrinogen decarboxylase, coproporphyrinogen                    
              oxidase, protoporphyrinogen oxidase and ferrochelatase) within the             
              cell and within the organelle.  Enzyme activities will be measured             
              in chloroplasts, mitochondria, and cytoplasmic fractions that have             
              been carefully isolated and assayed for integrity and                          
              contamination.  We will further explore the possibility that intact            
              plastids have the capacity to export porphyrinogens for                        
              mitochondrial heme synthesis.  Recent findings suggest that plants             
              treated with protoporphyrinogen oxidase inhibitors accumulate                  
              extraplastidic protoporphyrinogen.  Experiments to discover if any             
              of the enzymes which convert 5-aminolevulinic acid to                          
              protoporphyrinogen form a multienzyme complex within the plastid               
              are planned.  Substrate channeling between protoporphyrinogen                  
              oxidase and ferrochelatase will also be examined.  Two of the heme             
              and chlorophyll synthetic enzymes that have not been well studied              
              previously (coproporphyrinogen oxidase and ferrochelatase) will be             
              purified.  The purified proteins will be used to raise antibodies              
              in rabbits for use in studies on complex formation and localization            
              of these enzymes.
