Abstract    :
                     This study will continue geochronological and petrological              
              analyses of deformational and metamorphic fabrics in the southern              
              New England Appalachians.  A recently developed microtextural/                 
              geochronologic technique will be used to evaluate ages of                      
              deformational fabrics and will permit direct dating of shear zones.            
              A related study in the Scandinavian Caledonides will be integrated             
              with the New England study to evaluate and constrain tectonic                  
              models of the Appalachian-Caledonidian orogen.  The results will               
              be relevant to a broad range of tectonic problems in orogenic belts            
              and will also further refine the techniques of direct dating of                
              deformation.
