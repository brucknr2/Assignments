Abstract    :
              Indirect interactions among organisms are emerging as widespread,               
                                                                                            
              important factors in many ecological communities.  This research               
                                                                                             
              tests the general hypothesis that phytophagous insects interact                
              indirectly through strong effects on the spatial dynamics of                   
              natural enemy activity.  In particular, it assesses whether                    
              aphids (typically among the most abundant and widespread of all                
              phytophagous insects in temperate ecosystems) influence spatial                
              variation in the intensity of parasitism of other insects;                     
              parasitoids may accumulate in local areas, and increase their                  
              longevity and fecundity, by consuming aphid honeydew.  Insect                  
              communities of alfalfa provide an excellent test system.  Field                
              experiments in alfalfa will test for indirect effects of pea                   
              aphids on the alfalfa weevil, as mediated by a parasite wasp                   
              specific to the weevil, and as influenced by natural enemies of                
              the pea aphid (ladybeetles).  Investigating the web of indirect                
              as well as direct interactions in alfalfa insect communities                   
              provides opportunity not only to test for processes of general                 
              ecological interest, but also to contribute to more effective                  
              management of alfalfa insect pests.
