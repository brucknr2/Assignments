Abstract    :
                   This is a renewal of a 2-year project whose overall goal is               
              to study downstream fining by aggradation and selective deposition             
              in gravels.  The main results so far have produced downstream                  
              fining by a factor of two in a channel 50 m long and 0.3 m wide at             
              the St. Anthony Falls Hydraulic Laboratory (SAFHL), demonstrating              
              unequivocally that selective deposition is an effective fining                 
              mechanism and that it can be studied in laboratory experiments.                
              In parallel experiments at Johns Hopkins University (JHU), a novel             
              colored-grain system is providing the fractional-transport data                
              base needed to perdict the fining observed at SAFHL.  This phrase              
              now involves a series of runs a SAFHL with a channel width of 2.0              
              m; this will produce braided topography, enabling invesitgation of             
              the effect of lateral sorting and topography on downstream fining.             
              The present fractional-transport program at JHU, will continue                 
              adding components on the effect of sediment feed versus                        
              recirculation and the influence of small-scale sedimentary                     
              features.  Finally, a concurrent set of runs at MIT to examine                 
              local lateral sorting in a 1.0 m wide channel as well as the                   
              effects of varying deposit geometry and percent extraction is                  
              planned.  This research seems as the first real connection between             
              engineering hydraulics and fluvial sedimentology and represents                
              fundamental research related to sediment transport mechanics.
