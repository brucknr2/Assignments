Abstract    :
                   This research is a study of synoptic-scale evolution and                  
              vertical structure of intense convective events and westerly wind              
              bursts in the equatorial western Pacific.  the main objectives are             
              to : 1) complete a trial case study of such an event that occurred             
              during November, 1989, with pre-TOGA COARE data, 2) monitor the                
              synoptic situation during TOGA COARE to identify candidates for                
              subsequent case studies, and 3) analyze case studies drawn from the            
              TOGA COARE period in a similar way to the pre- TOGA COARE study to             
              gain a more complete understanding of how these events evolve and              
              interact with the ocean in that region.  Objective 3 includes the              
              analysis of data from four Integrated Sounding Systems, consisting             
              of surface meteorological instruments, a boundary layer wind                   
              profiler, and a portable omegasonde for vertical soundings of                  
              temperature, wind and moisture.  These observations will be                    
              supplemented with operational gridded analysis products from NMC               
              and ECMWF, OLR satellite data (as a proxy for convection), and                 
              oceanographic data from moorings in the TOGA TAO array.  The                   
              collective analysis of these data will provide insights into the               
              structure and evolution of synoptic-scale convective events and                
              atmospheric circulations thought to be associated with coupled air-            
              sea processes in the region.                                                   
                   This research is important because it is one of the TOGA COARE            
              studies examining the relationship between the convective-scale                
              physical processes and the larger scales of atmospheric circulation            
              in an especially climate sensitive region of the world, the western            
              Pacific Ocean, the field site of TOGA COARE.
