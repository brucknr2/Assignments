Abstract    :
                   This study will conduct paleomagnetic analyses of lower                   
              Paleozoic-aged rocks in Britain in order to define the movement of             
              Eastern Avalonia and closure history of the Iapetus Ocean during               
              the Silurian and Ordovician.  A broad picture of the                           
              paleogeographic setting of Eastern Avalonia has been recently                  
              developed and this work will provide much needed constraints.  The             
              results will be of broad significance to plate tectonic                        
              reconstructions of the Appalachian - Caleonide orogen.  They will              
              also provide additional criteria for the recognition of                        
              remagnetization phenomena, which is of considerable importance to              
              geophysicists interested in tectonic problems.
