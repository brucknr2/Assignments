Abstract    :
              The Department of Mathematics and Computer Science at the                      
              University of Kansas will purchase network display stations and                
              printers which will be dedicated to the support of research in                 
              the mathematical sciences.  The equipment will be used for                     
              several research projects in both computer science and                         
              mathematics, including in particular:
