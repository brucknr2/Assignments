Abstract    :
              The principal investigator will study the development of fracture-             
              controlled percolation networks through which dynamic fluids move.             
              The long-term objective is to more thoroughly understand the                   
              mineralogical development of metamorphic terranes, and the feedback            
              among thermal-chemical-mechanical processes during metamorphism,               
              as well as the spatial and temporal evolution of a dynamically                 
              changing system.
