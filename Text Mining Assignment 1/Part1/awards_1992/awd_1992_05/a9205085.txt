Abstract    :
              The principal investigators will study the role of fluids in                   
              contact metamorphic environments by continuing their investigation             
              of the Alta stock aureole, using integrated petrologic, isotopic,              
              and numerical modeling techniques. They will attempt to answer                 
              questions concerning the processes of flow and mass transport, the             
              physical/chemical properties of the metamorphic aquifer, and the               
              effects on patterns of flow and extent of fluid-rock interaction.              
              This investigation will be an important contribution to our                    
              understanding of the physical and chemical dynamics of rocks around            
              a cooling pluton.
