Abstract    :
                   This research is concerned with representation theory of                  
              infinite-dimensional Lie algebras with applications to quantum                 
              field theory.  A new approach to the study of integrals of motion              
              in deformations of two-dimensional conformal field theories will               
              be developed.  The modular functor for affine Kac-Moody algebras               
              at the rational level will be pursued, using geometrical                       
              properties of the corresponding representations.  The                          
              Langlands-Drinfeld correspondence for complex algebraic curves                 
              will be investigated.  Topological field theories, associated to               
              affine algebras, will be studied from the cohomological point of               
              view.  The quantum deformation of the Lie algebra of differential              
              operators on the circle will be studied in connection with the                 
              W-algebras.  Finally, the formulas for singular vectors in Verma               
              modules over the Virasoro algebra will be applied to the                       
              computation of the cohomologies of Lie algebras of vector fields.              
                   This research is concerned with a mathematical object called              
              a Lie algebra.  Lie algebras arise from another object called a                
              Lie group.  An example of a Lie group is the rotations of a                    
              sphere where one rotation is followed by another.  Lie groups and              
              Lie algebras are important in areas involving analysis of                      
              spherical motion.
