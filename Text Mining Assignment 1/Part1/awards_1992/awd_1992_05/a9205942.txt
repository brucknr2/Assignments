Abstract    :
              In this project, the PI will continue development of a theoretical             
              capability for global synthesis of the large ocean data sets to be             
              obtained during the World Ocean Circulation Experiment (WOCE).                 
              This capability consists of a series of inverse models, ranging in             
              scale from the North Atlantic to global that will eventually be                
              able to assimilate and synthesize data of many different types,                
              and to predict the state of the ocean described by the data,                   
              producing estimates of fluxes of heat, water, mass, momentum, and              
              energy.
