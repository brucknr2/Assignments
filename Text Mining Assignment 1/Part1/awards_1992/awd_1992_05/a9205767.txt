Abstract    :
                   The proposed research will utilize Pb and Sr isotope                      
              systematics to investigate weathering rates and mechanisms in areas            
              of granitoid bedrock.  Waters, soils and bedrock will be                       
              investigated from drainages with variable glacial histories in                 
              arctic, temperate and tropical regions.  Pb and Sr are well suited             
              for this study because each has highly variable isotope ratios in              
              granitic minerals, the two elements are concentrated into different            
              minerals, and they have complementary aquatic behavior.  Pb is                 
              relatively immobile in the hydrocycle (adsorbed by O-donor surface             
              groups), whereas Sr is mobile in the hydrocycle (remains in                    
              solution).  Pb and Sr isotopes studied in conjunction with other               
              trace metals, major cations and anions can be used to look through             
              secondary geochemical and biochemical processes and directly                   
              determine the relative rates of weathering of the various bedrock              
              minerals.  This study will have applications to estimations of                 
              modern weathering rates and mechanism in areas of variable climate             
              and glacial history.  We will also investigate the effects of                  
              global climate change of weathering by studying the fluvial and                
              lacustrine record of changes in the isotopic composition of Pb (in             
              Fe-Mn oxide coatings on sediment particles) and Sr (in calcareous              
              shells) released by weathering back through the stratigraphic                  
              record of glacial and interglacial cycles.
