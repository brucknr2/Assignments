Abstract    :
                   The principal investigator will study several weak                        
              formulations of the motion of a singular surface by its mean                   
              curvature. Such motion arises in the theory of phase transitions.              
              The work is part of an ongoing project to reconcile the various                
              mathematical models for the motion of phase boundaries. The                    
              principal investigator will study the existence of unit density                
              flows, the convergence of systems of phase-field equations, and                
              the existence and properties of self-similar solutions.                        
                   This award will support research in the general area of                   
              differential geometry and global analysis. Differential geometry               
              is the study of the relationship between the geometry of a space               
              and analytic concepts defined on the space. Global analysis is                 
              the study of the overall geometric and topological properties of               
              a space by piecing together local information. Applications of                 
              these areas of mathematics in other sciences include the                       
              structure of complicated molecules, liquid-gas boundaries, and                 
              the large scale structure of the universe.
