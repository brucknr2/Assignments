Abstract    :
                   There is growing evidence that borehole temperature profiles              
              in the upper 300 m of the earth contain recoverable and valuable               
              information on surface temperature histories over the last three               
              centuries, a time period critical for climate change studies.  The             
              PI will (1) develop a capability for routine 1 mK (0.001 K)                    
              temperature logging of drillholes, (2) evaluate the thermal                    
              stability of drillholes (ultimate noise level) in relation to                  
              existing theory, (3) partition curvature in borehole temperature               
              profiles into transient and steady-state components through repeat             
              logging, and (4) instrument a test borehole to be used in                      
              "observatory mode" with a weather station at the surface and fixed             
              thermistor string down hole.  The study will help define procedures            
              for placing error bounds on surface temperature histories and                  
              extracting maximum information on climate change out of borehole               
              temperature profiles.
