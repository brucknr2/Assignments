Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The PI proposes that a major consequence of the calcium rise at                
              fertilization in the sea urchin isthe activation of the                        
              calmodulin dependend enzyme, NAD kinase, which produces NADP. The              
              calcium rise also activates Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase,                 
              with the result that the NADP is rapidly reduced to NADPH. The                 
              resultant increase in the NADPH/NADP ratio then shifts the redox               
              poise of the cell to favor reduction which has consequences for                
              protein synthesis activation. Other regulatory changes emanate                 
              from the calcuim rise. The specific goals of the proposed                      
              research are to 1) affirm or negate the role of the NADPH change               
              in regulating protein synthesis in vivo and 2) determine whether               
              the NADPH/NADP ratio change is, in addition, acting through                    
              alteration of protein disulphide groups, as through a thioredoxin              
              or other protein oxidoreductase system.
