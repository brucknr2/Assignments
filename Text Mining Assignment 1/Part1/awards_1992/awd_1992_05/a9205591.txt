Abstract    :
                This research is to conduct geological studies of the two                    
              principal fault zones of Sumatra, Indonesia, in concert with                   
              ongoing geodetic studies of the region.  Dating of uplifted coral              
              reefs to document the timing, geographical extent and uplift of two            
              great historical subduction-zone earthquakes and their prehistoric             
              predecessors should provide a precise and complete record of great             
              subduction zone earthquakes in the region.  The right-lateral                  
              Sumatran fault will be dated by offset channels of datable                     
              pyroclastic deposits from the Sumatran volcanic arc.  The research             
              will address fundamental issues in earthquake mechanics and                    
              neotectonics and provide a firmer basis for seismic hazard                     
              evaluation in Sumatra.  This research is a component of the                    
              National Earthquake Hazard Reduction Program.
