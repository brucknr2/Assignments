Abstract    :
                This research is to extend a newly developed statistical                     
              tomography method to study velocity heterogeneities of different               
              tectonic units of the crust and upper mantle under California.                 
              This method, developed by the Principal Investigator and                       
              collaborators, is termed Stochastic Tomography and leads to a                  
              better depth resolution of heterogeneity of seismic velocities.                
              The method will be applied to seismic data of the CALNET in                    
              northern California and the SCARLET in southern California.  By                
              means of this method, study of the crust and upper mantle beneath              
              the seismically active regions should refine knowledge of the                  
              tectonic structures at levels below what has been possible in the              
              past.  This research is a component of the National Earthquake                 
              Hazard Reduction Program.
