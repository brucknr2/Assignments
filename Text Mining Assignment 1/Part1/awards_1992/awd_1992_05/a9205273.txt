Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The project designs storage and retrieval methods for multimedia               
              databases, in collaboration with Dr. Christodoulakis, head of the              
              MUSIC-FORTH Center, Chanea, Greece. Specifically, it focuses on                
              high-performance similarity retrieval of multimedia objects by                 
              content.  For text, it uses signature file methods, inversion and              
              combinations (hybrid methods). For images and other media (voice,              
              etc.), it examines indexing methods for high-dimensionality spaces,            
              treating objects as multi-dimensional points in feature space. Such            
              features could be, e.g., the Fourier-transform coefficients of an              
              image. Parallelism further improves the response time for large                
              objects, using declustering methods, e.g., based on fractals or                
              error correcting codes. The results of this work will be retrieval             
              and declustering methods for several types of media.  These methods            
              will serve as building blocks for the multimedia and object-                   
              oriented DBMSs of the near future.  This project, which is co-                 
              sponsored by the European Community Esprit program, will foster                
              collaboration between researchers in the United States and Europe,             
              enhance exchange of research results, and speed up development of              
              a new generation of DBMSs.
