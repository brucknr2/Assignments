Abstract    :
              The principal investigator will continue his study of the granite-             
              diorite-gabbro complex on the Isle au Haut, Maine, utilizing field,            
              petrographic, geochemical, and isotopic techniques. Results will               
              be used to understand a variety of processes that operate during               
              the development of igneous plutons and to test models of magmatic              
              evolution.
