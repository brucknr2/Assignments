Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The 1992 Northeast Regional Conference on Developmental Biology                
              will be held at the Marine Biological Laboratory, Woods Hole, MA               
              on the weekend of May 1-3. This proposal is for funds to support               
              graduate student attendance and participation at the meeting. The              
              Conference is organized with the intent of bringing  together a                
              broad range of developmental biologists, at various stages of                  
              their careers, to present and discuss their research in formal                 
              and informal settings. Further, the organizers continue to                     
              integrate research in both plant and animal developmental biology              
              in an effort to enhance the communication between groups that                  
              have traditionally been separated. The Conference will include                 
              four formal platform sessions and two poster presentation                      
              sessions, as well as a keynote address and a second featured                   
              presentation by prominent developmental biologists. The                        
              established investigators chairing the platform sessions are                   
              encouraged to solicit presentation from graduate students,                     
              postdoctorals, and junior faculty, and all graduate students                   
              attending the meeting are encouraged to present their work in the              
              poster sessions.
