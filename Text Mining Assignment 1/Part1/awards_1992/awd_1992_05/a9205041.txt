Abstract    :
              This proposed research is a continuation of the previous                       
              investigations on excitation cross section measurement of molecular            
              oxygen by electron impact for Pseudo-continuum region (4 - 7 eV                
              energy loss) and an extensive data analysis of Schumann-Runge                  
              region ( 7 - 10 eV energy -loss).                                              
              This experimental and theoretical joint research program will                  
              determine absolute electron impact cross sections for all the                  
              important electronic transitions of molecular oxygen in the 4 - 10             
              eV energy loss region.  Differential cross sections of                         
              identifiabled electronic states and vibrational excitations of                 
              electronic states will be measured by a crossed-beam method over               
              angles ranging from 12 to 160o with impact energies ranging from               
              near threshold to 200 eV.  From the observed electron impact                   
              process, the dissociation products will be identified by a detailed            
              analysis of the combined photoabsorption and electron energy-loss              
              data for the dissociation of O2 into ground and excited stated                 
              atomic fragments ( O(1D), O(1S)).  These results will be analyzed              
              by an extensive configuration interaction calculation, performed at            
              Los Alamos National Laboratory in order to obtain potential energy             
              curves and dipole electronic transition moments from the ground                
              state to the excited states.
