Abstract    :
                   This project will focus on mathematical problems of complex               
              analysis and geometry.  Specifically, work will be done on                     
              questions in complex manifold theory and Kahler geometry.                      
              Several major areas are mapped out in the proposal, including                  
              that of superrigidity of compact quotients of irreducible                      
              Riemannian symmetric manifolds.  By this one understands                       
              manifolds with the property that any smooth transformation to a                
              nonpositively curved manifold must be homotopic to an isometry.                
              The goal of this work is to prove superrigidity of quotients of                
              symmetric manifolds other than balls.  Another direction will                  
              involve the global nondeformability of compact Hermitian                       
              symmetric manifolds.  This work will build on a recent proof of                
              the nondeformability of complex projective space using a                       
              technique which counts the number of zeros of holomorphic vector               
              fields.  Additionally, work will be done on the Hartshorne                     
              conjecture concerning the nonempty intersection of two complex                 
              submanifolds with positive normal bundle in a projective                       
              algebraic manifold.  Current research suggests such intersections              
              must always be nonempty if the sum of their dimensions is at                   
              least the dimension of the ambient manifold.  At least three                   
              different approaches are planned.
