Abstract    :
                   Statistical methodology provides important quantitative                   
              tools in numerous areas of research including meeting national                 
              goals for improved quality and productivity, the evaluation of                 
              environmental hazards and technological progress coming from                   
              research in chemistry and chemical engineering.  This conference               
              will involve leading statisticians, chemists and chemical                      
              engineers from industry, government and universities to examine                
              the ways in which the most meaningful data can be obtained and                 
              transformed into useful information for research and new                       
              developments in chemistry and chemical engineering.  Important                 
              problems of high priority in these areas will be presented to                  
              research statisticians; and in their turn, applied chemists and                
              statisticians can learn firsthand about new statistical research               
              results to apply in their work.  Together these groups may                     
              formulate priorities for future statistical research directions                
              in this interface.
