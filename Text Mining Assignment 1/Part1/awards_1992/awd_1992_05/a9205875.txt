Abstract    :
                   This award will fill a critical gap in Pacific apparent polar             
              wander through analysis of the skewness of profiles recording Vine-            
              Matthews magnetic anomalies.  The PI will combine together skewness            
              data using a new method that has developed to solve simultaneously             
              for the paleomagnetic pale latitude, longitude and their 95%                   
              confidence limits, and anomalous skewness and its 95% confidence               
              limits that best fit the data in a maximum-likelihood, least-                  
              squares sense.  She will analyze the skewness of Pacific anomalies             
              12r-24r (32-57 Ma).  These data will fill a large gap in                       
              paleomagnetic data for the critical interval preceding the elbow               
              in the Hawaiian-Emperor chain and spanning the major plate                     
              reorganization during chrons 21-25.  She will use the results to               
              further constrain the timing and rate of southward motion of the               
              Hawaiian hotspot relative to the paleomagnetic axis, to construct              
              a detailed chronology of anomalous skewness, to test alternative               
              plate reconstructions, and to investigate the geocentric axial                 
              dipole hypothesis.
