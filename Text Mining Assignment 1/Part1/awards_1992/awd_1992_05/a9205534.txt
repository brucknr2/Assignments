Abstract    :
                    The Department of Mathematics and Center for Applied                     
              Mathematics and Statistics at the New Jersey Institute of                      
              Technology will purchase a graphics workstation environment at                 
              an estimated discounted cost of $23,000 a Silicon Graphics Indigo              
              with mass storage devices, and a color printer/plotter which will              
              be dedicated to the support of research in the mathematical                    
              sciences.  The equipment will be used for several projects,                    
              including in particular:
