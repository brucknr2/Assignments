Abstract    :
              This project is to determine the timing, genesis, and evolution of             
              the Karoo continental flood basalt province in Southern Africa.                
              Particular emphasis will be placed on the flow-by-flow stratigraphy            
              of the basalt flows using field mapping and chemical techniques,               
              and their relative and absolute ages.  These data will be used to              
              constrain both the physical nature and the duration of this                    
              exceptionally large volcanic event, to correlate the numerous                  
              eroded remnants of Karoo basalt now scattered over large areas of              
              southern Namibia, Botswana, Lesotho, and South Africa, and to                  
              correlate the flows with the numerous Karoo dikes found across                 
              southern Africa.  The increased knowledge of the physical evolution            
              of the province will then be used in conjunction with the                      
              compositional data to model mantle melting, fractionation and                  
              crustal assimilation in the production of the basaltic magmas and              
              to constrain the composition of their source.
