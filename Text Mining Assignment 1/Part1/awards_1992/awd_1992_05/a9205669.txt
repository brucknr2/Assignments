Abstract    :
                This research is to determine the Quaternary slip rate at two                
              sites along the Garlock fault and at one site along the Owl Lake               
              fault, in southern California.  At all three sites, channel walls              
              on alluvial fans are left-laterally offset several tens of meters.             
              Photogrammetry and trench excavation techniques will be used.                  
              Dating of events will be done by a number of techniques depending              
              on material uncovered in the excavations.  The results of these                
              projects will provide information useful for evaluating the seismic            
              hazard posed by the Garlock fault, as well as for constraining                 
              tectonic models of the region surrounding the Garlock fault.  This             
              research is a component of the National Earthquake Hazard Reduction            
              Program.
