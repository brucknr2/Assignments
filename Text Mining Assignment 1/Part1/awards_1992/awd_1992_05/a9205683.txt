Abstract    :
              The Department of Mathematics at the University of Michigan will               
              purchase 20 Sparc workstations, two printers and needed                        
              networking which will be dedicated to support of research in the               
              mathematical sciences.  The equipment will be used for several                 
              research projects in algebra, combinatorics, scientific                        
              computation, analysis and computational geometry/topology.                     
              Primarily the equipment being purchased will be used by graduate               
              students and junior faculty working in these areas in                          
              collaboration with senior faculty and additionally by three                    
              senior faculty.
