Abstract    :
                   Nistor will continue his work in that part of the theory of               
              operator algebras relating to noncommutative geometry, and                     
              particularly index theory and cyclic cohomology.  His immediate                
              goals include a formula for the bivariant Chern-Connes character               
              and the identification of the Atiyah-Singer integrand,                         
              computation of the cyclic cohomology of foliation algebras using               
              Bott's simplicial methods, and a combination of these two into an              
              index theorem for foliations.                                                  
                   The general area of mathematics of this project has its                   
              basis in the theory of algebras of Hilbert space operators.                    
              Operators can be thought of as finite or infinite matrices of                  
              complex numbers.  Special types of operators are often put                     
              together in an algebra, naturally called an operator algebra.                  
              These abstract objects have a surprising variety of applications.              
              For example, they play a key role in knot theory, which in turn                
              is  currently being used to study the structure of DNA, and they               
              are of fundamental importance in noncommutative geometry, which                
              is becoming increasingly important in physics.
