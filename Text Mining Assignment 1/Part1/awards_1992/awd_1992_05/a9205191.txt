Abstract    :
                   Sequences of paleosols and loess units throughout the world               
              have been interpreted as geologic records of terrestrial climate               
              change.  Of particular significance has been the discovery of a                
              correlation between variations in the magnetic susceptibility in               
              the Chinese loess sequence and the oxygen isotope record of the                
              deep sea.  Using an approach that combines rock magnetic                       
              measurements with a soil chemistry extraction procedure, we have               
              obtained new data that challenges previous interpretations about               
              the origin and nature of the magnetic susceptibility signal.  In               
              this proposal we request support for a comprehensive,                          
              interdisciplinary study of the rock magnetism and soil chemistry of            
              paleosol/loess sequences in China and elsewhere.  The goals of our             
              study are 1) to complete our determination of the general                      
              characteristics of the magnetic susceptibility signal using a                  
              combination of rock magnetic and soil chemistry techniques, 2) to              
              compare our rock magnetic analyses of the Chinese loess/paleosol               
              sequence with similar analyses of loess/paleosols sequences in                 
              Alaska and New Zealand, and 3) to obtain complete soil descriptions            
              and detailed profiles of soil chemistry and rock magnetic                      
              properties from selected loess and paleosols units.  The work for              
              this last objective will be done in close collaboration with                   
              Chinese colleagues.
