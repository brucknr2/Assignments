Abstract    :
              The principal investigator will utilize sulfur isotopes and the                
              laser microprobe to evaluate the effect of metamorphism on the                 
              degree of re-equilibration of sulfur isotope thermometers. By                  
              studying sixteen different volcanogenic massive sulfide deposits               
              ranging in metamorphic grade from zeolite to amphibolite facies,               
              he will also determine whether temperature information is preserved            
              in such deposits.
