Abstract    :
              The local structure in thin films of YBa2Cu3O7 (YBCO) and (La                  
              Sr)2CuO4 superconductors will be investigated using a series of                
              EXAFS experiments. The behavior of the c-axis Cu(1)-O(4) and the               
              Cu(2)-O(4) bonds as O is removed and reintroduced in the same                  
              sample via anneals will be measured to determine how the                       
              anharmonicity changes with Tc. Substituted samples will be studied             
              to understand how the local structure and site, Jc, and                        
              quasiparticle lifetimes depend on different dopants. This will be              
              clarified with c-axis and a-axis films. More dilute concentrations             
              of Fe, Cu, Ni and Zn in bulk YBCO will be investigated as the low              
              concentration regime may be important for controlling or limiting              
              the quasiparticle lifetime.
