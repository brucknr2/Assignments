Abstract    :
                 This project is focused toward increasing our understanding of              
              the role(s) played by virally-encoded movement proteins (MP) in                
              facilitating the transport of viral RNA between cells of the                   
              infected host plant.  The research plan calls for the generation of            
              a series of chimeric MPs, produced by genetic recombination of                 
              distantly-related tobamoviruses, in an effort to determine which               
              protein motifs affect virulence, host specificity, and                         
              intercellular transport.  The plan will also involve the expression            
              and study of MP from sunn-hemp mosaic virus (SHMV) in transgenic               
              plants to determine its effects on plasmodesmatal structure and                
              sieving properties.  Finally, photochemical crosslinking studies               
              will be performed on inoculated protoplasts, to assess MP binding              
              to RNA during infection and/or transport.

                 A major facet of the viral infection of host plants involves the            
              intercellular movement of viral nucleic acids through                          
              plasmodesmata.  This transport is facilitated by a series of viral             
              proteins known collectively as the movement proteins.  The                     
              generation of chimeric movement proteins is a creative approach to             
              assess their specificity and function.  This work will provide                 
              significant, new information on an important problem in plant                  
              pathology.
