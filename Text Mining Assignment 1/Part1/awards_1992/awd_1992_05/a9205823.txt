Abstract    :
              The principal investigator will do fundamental analytical research             
              on the nature of chemical zoning                                               
              in metamorphic porphyroblasts, and will develop detailed models for            
              the processes that produce both                                                
              prograde and retrograde zoning. The data will be used to constrain             
              theoretical models for garnet                                                  
              zoning as a kinetic monitor of metamorphic heating and cooling                 
              rates.
