Abstract    :
              The primary                                                                    
              objective of this project is to elucidate the molecular mechanisms             
              by which a cloned gene called Frt1 induces development of mushrooms            
              (fruiting bodies) in the woodrotting fungus Schizophyllum  commune.            
              Analysis of the protein sequence predicted from the corresponding              
              cDNA, and other data, indicate that Ftr1 encodes a membrane-                   
              associated protein that functions through some form of self versus             
              non-self recognition and that its activity is influenced by                    
              activity of the mating-type genes and a linked genetic element.                
              These concepts will be tested by the following methods:1) a tag to             
              determine the location of FRT1 within cells.  2)  Employ the                   
              techniques of in vivo mutagenesis to start determining which parts             
              of the Frt1 sequence are essential for activity.  3) Isolate and               
              start characterizing the linked DNA sequence which, in addition to             
              Frt1, is essential for fruiting this will be done using the method             
              of DNA-mediated transformation to test the sequences flanking Frt1             
              for their ability to restore the fruiting phenotype in the                     
              appropriate Frt1 deletion mutations.  4) Isolate and start                     
              characterizing an alternate allele of Frt1 by using Frt1 , and/or              
              flanking sequences, as probe to a clone bank of an alternate strain            
              of S. commune.                                                                 
              %%%                                                                            
              Mechanistic concepts elucidated by studying genetic regulation of              
              this important developmental process in this relatively simple                 
              eukaryote should be applicable to an understanding of similar                  
              processes in more complex, less accessible organisms.
