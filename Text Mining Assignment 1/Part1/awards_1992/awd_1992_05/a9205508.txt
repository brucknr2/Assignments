Abstract    :
              This investigation will include determination of the relevant                  
              hydraulic and physical characteristics of the carbonate host rocks             
              and the stratigraphic environment.  Field work will be conducted               
              to measure fracture densities and orientations for input to a                  
              numerical model of flow through fracture networks.  These data and             
              fracture flow estimates will then be applied to a numerical model              
              to simulate flow of mineralizing fluids and heat in the area of ore            
              mineralization.  Flow patterns and temperature distributions                   
              established with this flow model will then be used with a chemical             
              speciation model to simulate zones of ore and gangue mineral                   
              precipitation.  The model will be used to test several postulated              
              ore transport and emplacement mechanisms.  Results of this research            
              will help validate or constrain hypotheses on the formation of the             
              Upper Mississippi Valley ore deposits, as well as Mississippi                  
              Valley-Type deposits in general.
