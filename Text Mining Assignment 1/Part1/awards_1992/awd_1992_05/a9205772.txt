Abstract    :
              This study proposes to extend work on processes and sources of                 
              continental margin magmas, with particular reference to the central            
              Andes (volcanic) and Sierra Nevada (plutonic) provinces.  Focussing            
              on the inclusions will allow the PIs to: 1) better constrain the               
              compositions of magmatic and crustal components; 2) evaluate                   
              timescales of contamination by examining the length scales over                
              which isotopic equilibration of included material has occurred; 3)             
              better estimate the composition of the mantle source to continental            
              margin magmas -  in particular whether the lithosphere or                      
              asthenosphere is the predominant source; 4) mass balance the                   
              contributions of crustal versus mantle-derived components to                   
              evaluate the extent of intra-crustal recycling. As a result, a much            
              better understanding should be gained of the processes affecting               
              magmatic composition in continental-margin arcs.
