Abstract    :
              The principal investigator will conduct experiments designed to                
              assess near-equilibrium mineral-fluid reaction kinetics at elevated            
              temperatures and pressures. The experiments will combine recently              
              developed isotopic doping techniques with flow-thru approaches                 
              to better constrain the role of fluid chemistry and temperature on             
              the rate of mineral dissolution and precipitation when chemical                
              affinity of the reaction is near-zero. Results will be applied to              
              hydrothermal alteration processes and submarine geothermal systems.
