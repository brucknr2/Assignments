Abstract    :
                   Funds will support an international workshop devoted to the               
              organization of an international program (ALBICORE) to investigate             
              global patterns of climatic-oceanic response to orbital forcing in             
              the Mid-Cretaceous greenhouse (ca. 100 million years BP).                      
                                                                                             
                   Our work in the Italian Albian has revealed sedimentary and               
              paleontological oscillations with periods corresponding to those               
              of the orbital variations.  Such responses of different sorts have             
              been recorded in other Mesozoic stratigraphic sequences, but remain            
              isolated cases.  Greenhouse climates responded to orbital forcing,             
              but application to a better understanding of Climates and                      
              Geochronology calls for developing a global picture of the                     
              responses for a given time.                                                    
                                                                                             
                   ALBICORE is designed to foment international work on such a               
              time-slice - the Albian sub-zone of Ticinella  praeticinensis.                 
              The workshop seeks (1) to generate interest by showing what has                
              been accomplished, and the promise of extending such work; (2) to              
              demonstrate the multidisciplinary techniques (sedimentological,                
              paleontological, geochemical and geophysical) that we have                     
              developed and found useful, and to discuss alternatives and                    
              improvements; and (3) to develop an overall plan of procedure,                 
              including (a) a set of tactical ACTION GROUPS that would undertake             
              the drilling of cores and their analysis, (b) ADVISORY COMMITTEES              
              that would serve to advise on techniques and would be helpful in               
              finding laboratory facilities, and (c) a STEERING COMMITTEE that               
              would coordinate the global effort.
