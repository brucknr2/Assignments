Abstract    :
                   This research will investigate both single hop and multihop               
              architectures for terabit networks.  The approaches will exploit               
              the characteristics of WDM lightwave technology so that efficient              
              protocols and easily-reconfigurable architectures can be developed.            
              For single-hop systems,  the PI will examine both                              
              control-channel-based and non-control-channel-based protocols and              
              integrate packet-switched protocols as well as mechanisms to                   
              accommodate circuit-switched traffic.  The approaches will employ              
              realistic assumptions on optical component characteristics (e.g.,              
              nonzero transceiver tuning times), and they will be aimed at                   
              supporting a multiuser base (possibly 1000's) which can be                     
              time-varying scalable.  For multihop architectures, the PI will                
              investigate optimal node placement in regular structures to suit               
              nonuniform traffic conditions.  In  addition, he will study dynamic            
              reconfiguration algorithms of the embedded virtual network topology            
              to combat changes in the offered traffic conditions and explore                
              alternative multihop architectures for suitability of application              
              to optical networks.  The PI will also consider if various                     
              single-hop and multihop systems can be compared in a meaningful                
              fashion (assuming equivalent system parameters).  He will try to               
              develop techniques which will to understand under what                         
              circumstances a given architecture may be considered superior to               
              others.
