Abstract    :
                   This award will provide funding to upgrade an X-ray                       
              fluorescence spectrometer and to make improvements in the sample               
              preparation facilities of the X-ray fluorescence laboratory in the             
              Department of Earth & Planetary Sciences at Washington University              
              in St. Louis. The upgrade will allow this facility to achieve                  
              state-of-the-art analytical capability for the analysis of major               
              and trace elements in rocks and minerals at a fraction of the cost             
              of purchasing a new instrument.                                                
                   The XRF laboratory is run as a departmental facility open to              
              all members of the Washington University community and to regional             
              users from other midwestern universities and colleges, including               
              members of the PEW Consortium of undergraduate institutions.
