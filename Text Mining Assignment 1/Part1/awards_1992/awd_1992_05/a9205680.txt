Abstract    :
              The Department of Applied Mathematical Sciences of the University              
              of Houston-Downtown will purchase a high-speed workstation, and a              
              compatible high-performance co-processor array.  This equipment                
              will be used in the following research projects.                               
              Project 1                                                                      
                   To develop adaptive grid refinement algorithms which can be               
              used for solution of the Navier-Stokes equations.                              
              Project 2                                                                      
                   To develop parallel numerical algorithms to find reliable                 
              global numerical solutions for very large nonlinear systems of                 
              equations by using preconditioned Interval Newton Methods.
