Abstract    :
                This research involves a large-scale land and ocean bottom                   
              seismic array experiment over the entire North Island of New                   
              Zealand and its adjacent regions as an international cooperative               
              project between Memphis State University of the United States,                 
              ORSTROM of France, DSIR and Victoria University of New Zealand, and            
              the University of Leeds of the United Kingdom.  At least 100,                  
              three-component digital seismic stations will be deployed on land              
              and 12 digital ocean bottom seismographs wull be deploye dto cover             
              the entire geometry of the Wadati-Benioff zone beneath New                     
              Zealand.  The results will refine the tectonic structure of an                 
              active trench and strike-slip fault region and will bear on                    
              evaluation of the seismic hazard of this active area.  This                    
              research is a component of the National Earthquake Hazard Reduction            
              Program.
