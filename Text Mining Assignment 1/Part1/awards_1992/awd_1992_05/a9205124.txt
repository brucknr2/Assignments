Abstract    :
              This project covers the reduction of raw data from the radome                  
              type gust probe systems and from the fast response temperature                 
              and humidity sensors installed on the two NOAA WP3Ds for the                   
              TOGA/COARE field experiment.  Previous experience with these data              
              sensors indicates that high quality turbulence data as well as                 
              data for sensible and latent heat fluxes will be obtained.                     
                                                                                             
              This research is important because it serves as one of the                     
              studies of TOGA COARE that links convective scale physical                     
              processes to the larger scales that impact climate variability in              
              an especially climate sensitive region of the world, the western               
              Pacific Ocean, the field site of TOGA COARE.
