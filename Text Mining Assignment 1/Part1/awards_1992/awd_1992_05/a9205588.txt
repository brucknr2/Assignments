Abstract    :
                This research is a continuation of the use of long-period body               
              wave data to resolve aspherical elastic and anelastic structure                
              in the mantle.  New data from the Global Digital Network will be               
              used to update absolute and differential body-wave travel times                
              as well as add new differential body-wave types.  Attenuation                  
              parameters for the differential phases will be used to constrain               
              3-D attenuation structure.  In the inversion for earth structure               
              with this data, constraints will be applied from free-oscillation              
              and stacking results generated in other studies.  The 3-D                      
              structure of the mantle has broad implications on convection in                
              the mantle and core; convection is the primary driving force for               
              plate tectonics and distortion on the surface of the earth.
