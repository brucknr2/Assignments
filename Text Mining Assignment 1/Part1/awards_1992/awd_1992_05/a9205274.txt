Abstract    :
                   By detailed field work and modeling, the late Quaternary                  
              sediment record in Illinois will be investigated to determine the              
              origin of subglacial tills that were deposited in the marginal area            
              of the Laurentide Ice Sheet.  Massive, homogenous diamictons that              
              classically have been interpreted to be lodgement till may instead             
              have originated primarily through subglacial deformation in a                  
              deforming bed.  Reconstructions of the Lake Michigan Lobe profile              
              in Illinois and preliminary field study of glacigenic sediment are             
              consistent with evidence of a deforming bed that has been suggested            
              on theoretical grounds.                                                        
                   Methods will consist of two summers of detailed                           
              sedimentological and structural study of carefully selected sites,             
              focusing on differentiating subglacial till that is relatively                 
              undeformed from till that has experienced internal deformation by              
              pervasive subglacial shearing to large strains.  Further analysis              
              will consist of:  (1) geotechincal analyses in order to evaluate               
              rheological parameters of the till; (2) determining sediment                   
              transport fluxes during the maximum of the last glaciation and                 
              comparing those data will data derived from different models of                
              glacial transport; and (3) numerical modeling of the Lake Michigan             
              Lobe ice-till system.  The results of this research will have                  
              significant implications for interpreting the origin of massive,               
              homogenous till units in mid-latitude regions, as well as for                  
              understanding and modeling the dynamics of the Laurentide Ice                  
              Sheet.
