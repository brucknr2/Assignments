Abstract    :
                   Kupiainen will continue his investigations of the                         
              statistical mechanics of disordered systems.  The purpose of this              
              program is to develop exact renormalization group methods to the               
              study of a wide variety of such systems.  These include classical              
              systems of the Lorentz gas type and lattice  versions thereof as               
              well as diffusion in quantum systems.  He will also continue his               
              research in conformal field theory, centered around the WZW                    
              model.                                                                         
                   Modern physics, quantum mechanics and relativity, is a                    
              product of the twentieth century.  It is founded firmly in the                 
              last century's attempt to address the microstructure of matter                 
              and to come to grips with the concepts of action-at-a distance,                
              electro-magnetism, and heat radiation.  The mathematical                       
              foundations for these developments, collectively called                        
              mathematical physics, ranges from detailed analysis of                         
              Schroedinger operators, which governs the dynamics of particles,               
              to unified field theory, which attempts to unite the four known                
              forces into a single theory.
