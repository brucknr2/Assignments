Abstract    :
                   This grant supports the research of Professor Daniel                      
              Goldston in analytic number theory.  Professor Goldston will use               
              a new approximation to the von Mangoldt lambda function to study               
              problems that were previously examined with the circle method.                 
              He will also study pair correlations of the zeros of zeta                      
              functions and Siegel zeros.                                                    
                   The field of analytic number theory applies to the discrete               
              realm of the whole numbers the techniques of analysis, dependent               
              on the notions of continuity and limit, originating in calculus.               
              The idea of using continuous methods to investigate the discrete               
              is two centuries old, but with the work of the modern analytic                 
              number theorists, the field has had a new rebirth.
