Abstract    :
                   The project were (1) test the eolian/pedogenic accretionary               
              model of desert pavement formation by cosmogenic 3He exposure age              
              dating at selected study sites in the Mojave Desert and Great Basin            
              of western North America and in the Atacama Desert of South                    
              America; (2) elucidate the types of pedogenic (e.g., vesicular A               
              horizon formation), physical (e.g.,soil deformation and particle               
              movement) and biological (e.g., clast displacement due to plant                
              growth) processes operating on and modifying pavements by field and            
              laboratory investigations; and (3) establish a potential                       
              terrestrial analog for planetary studies of ancient Martian                    
              regolith development.  Initial cosmogenic 3He surface exposure ages            
              on clasts from pavements developed on basaltic lava flow surfaces              
              confirm that clasts have remained at the pavement surface since the            
              eruption of the lava flow.  Traditional and experimental methods               
              of soil deformation and clast movement in 3-D space will be                    
              accomplished at selected study plots using subsurface and surface              
              measurements.  These data sets will be compared with (1) soil                  
              profile properties and development within the study plots, (2)                 
              chemical weathering parameters on clasts from the pavement and at              
              various levels within the subsurface, and (3) plant transect and               
              trench data showing relations between plant distribution and                   
              pavement properties and bioturbation and clast concentrations in               
              the eolian accretionary mantle.  This research will help the                   
              endeavors of field geologists who use pavements for mapping                    
              purposes, geomorphologists and geochronologists who use pavements              
              for dating landscapes, archaeologists who examine cultural artifact            
              distribution on pavements, Quaternary geologists who reconstruct               
              paleoenvironments of land surfaces in desert regions of the world,             
              and planetary geologists who seek terrestrial analogs for the                  
              evolution of the Martian regolith.
