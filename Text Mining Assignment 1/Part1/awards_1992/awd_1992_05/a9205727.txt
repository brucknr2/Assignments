Abstract    :
                   The need for a better understanding of the relation between               
              hydrologic extremes (droughts and floods) and long term climatic               
              variability is underscored by concerns of anthropogenic climate                
              change.  Investigations into these relations using closed basin                
              lakes and their basin hydrology are proposed.  The Great Salt Lake             
              basin is arid and heterogeneous.  Its climatic signal is well                  
              correlated with the Western U.S.                                               
                   Recent climate research into sources of determinism (e.g.                 
              ENSO) in global climatic variability has been very fruitful.  Such             
              research has blossomed through creative data interpretation, and               
              modeling of feedbacks and interactions.  The proposed research is              
              in the same spirit.  On interest is the identification of                      
              persistent climatic anomalies, their generating regimes; the                   
              aggregate basin hydrologic response and feedbacks; transitions                 
              between regimes; their sensitivity to initial conditions and                   
              parameters, and to dynamic changes in forcing functions.  A                    
              nonlinear dynamical systems perspective is adopted.  Nonparametric             
              methods for data analysis and systgm identification are proposed.              
              Physical and data based arguments for the possibility of chaotic               
              behavior in the coupled lake-basin-climate system, and the presence            
              of multiple regimes are advanced.  The development of finite                   
              physical-statistical-dynamic models to study system sensitivities              
              is proposed.
