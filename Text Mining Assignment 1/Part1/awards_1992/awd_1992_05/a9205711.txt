Abstract    :
                     The interaction of major strike-slip faults and regional low-           
              angle detachment faults in extending terranes is of considerable               
              interest.  This renewal project focuses on the Kingston Range                  
              detachment fault and associated plutons that is located near the               
              enigmatic eastern terminus of the Garlock fault, and involves                  
              additional field mapping and laboratory analysis in the Shadow                 
              Mountains area.  Results will document the complex stratigraphic               
              and structural relationships between crustal extension, high-level             
              synkinematic plutonism, and extension-related terrestrial                      
              sedimentation.
