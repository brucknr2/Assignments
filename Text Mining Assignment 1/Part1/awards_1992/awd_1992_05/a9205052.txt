Abstract    :
                 Vacuolar function is essential to the regulation of cytosolic               
              calcium levels.  Calcium-binding proteins unique to the vacuolar               
              membrane have been identified.  The immediate goal of this project             
              is to purify and characterize these proteins in terms of affinity,             
              capacity, and cation selectivity.  Polyclonal antibodies will be               
              used to study the tissue-specific expression patterns of these                 
              proteins, particularly with regard to the process of vacuolation               
              and biogenesis of the vacuole membrane system.  Antibody will                  
              further serve to identify cDNA clones in expression libraries                  
              encoding these proteins.                                                       
              %%%                                                                            
              Plant cells contain large membrane-enclosed compartments, which                
              serve a number of biochemical and structural functions for the                 
              plant cell.  Some of these are relatively "universal" functions                
              associated generally with lysosome-type compartments; others are               
              unique for plants.   Accordingly, the vacuole has an essential role            
              in growth and development.  It is remarkable that few vacuolar                 
              membrane activities have been examined and fewer still have been               
              identified and examined at the molecular level.  There is not yet              
              a clear understanding of either the origins of this organelle or               
              the means by which vacuolar membrane proteins are continuously                 
              replenished.    This study will contribute to an understanding of              
              the molecular basis for the role of the vacuole in conferring to               
              higher plants the ability to respond to its environment and carry              
              out the normal processes of growth and development.
