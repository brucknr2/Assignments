Abstract    :
                   The principal investigator will continue his study of                     
              integrable systems. In particular he will develop a new theory of              
              webs based on an analysis of the structure equations for the G-                
              structure associated to a web of high rank. He will also study                 
              the geometry of the moduli of Calabi-Yau three folds and the                   
              singularities of minimal Lagrangian submanifolds.                              
                   This award will support research in the general area of                   
              differential geometry and global analysis. Differential geometry               
              is the study of the relationship between the geometry of a space               
              and analytic concepts defined on the space. Global analysis is                 
              the study of the overall geometric and topological properties of               
              a space by piecing together local information. Applications of                 
              these areas of mathematics in other sciences include the                       
              structure of complicated molecules, liquid-gas boundaries, and                 
              the large scale structure of the universe.
