Abstract    :
                   This project aims to develop new efficient                                
              maximum-likelihood soft-decision decoding algorithms for linear                
              block codes and convolutional codes. The approach used here is to              
              convert the decoding problem into a search problem through a                   
              graph which is a trellis for an equivalent code of the                         
              transmitted code.  Algorithm A*, which is widely used in                       
              Artificial Intelligence search problems, is used to search                     
              through this graph.  This search is guided by an evaluation                    
              function f defined to take advantage of the information provided               
              by the received vector and the inherent properties of the                      
              transmitted code.  This function f is used to drastically reduce               
              the search space and to make the decoding efforts of these                     
              decoding algorithms adaptable to the noise level.  Preliminary                 
              results indicate a possible breakthrough in the decoding of                    
              linear block codes. Successful application to convolutional codes              
              should make possible the use of maximum-likelihood  soft-decision              
              decoders for large constraint length convolutional codes in                    
              practical communications systems.
