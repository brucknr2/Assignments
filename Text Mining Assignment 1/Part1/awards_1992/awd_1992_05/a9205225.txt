Abstract    :
              The Department of Statistics at Yale University will purchase                  
              workstations and peripherals that will be dedicated to support                 
              research in the mathematical sciences.  The research to be                     
              supported lies in:                                                             
              1. Product partition models for evaluating and selecting                       
              classifications;                                                               
              2. Theory of empirical processes, with applications to                         
              econometrics and semiparametric models                                         
              3. Mixture models, the development of graphical diagnostics and                
              formal tests for identifying the presence of mixing in                         
              generalized linear models, and for determining the numbers of                  
              components of finite mixtures;                                                 
              4. Probabilistic models for molecular evolution, including                     
              alternatives to the traditional branching tree.
