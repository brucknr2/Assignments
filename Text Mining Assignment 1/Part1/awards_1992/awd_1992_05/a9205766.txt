Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  The goal of this proposal is to examine the molecular basis               
              of the physiological phenomenon termed `competence' which is used              
              here to describe the appearance of responsiveness to a hormone                 
              that results in the expression of new genes. The appearance of the             
              competent state is thought to be due to structural changes in                  
              regulatory regions of these genes that permit the binding of                   
              proteins, such as hormone receptors and other transcriptional                  
              factors, to specific nucleotide sequences. This study should help              
              us to understand how hormones regulate gene expression.                        
                   Two genes expressed during egg development in the mosquito,               
              Aedes aegypti, will be examined; a vitellogenin and a vitelline                
              envelope protein gene, both of which are under the control of 20-              
              hydroxyecdysone. We have shown that the vitellogenin gene of the               
              newly enclosed adult female is not capable of responding to 20-                
              hydroxyecdysone, and that competence to respond appears during the             
              first two days after eclosion in response to juvenile hormone. We              
              propose to use a mobility shift assay to follow changes in the                 
              binding of proteins to the regulatory regions of these two genes               
              during the acquisition of competence and after exposure to 20-                 
              hydroxyecdysone and juvenile hormone.
