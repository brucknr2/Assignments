Abstract    :
              This award in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic                  
              Program provides support for research by Dr. M. David Curtis of                
              the Chemistry Department, University of Michigan, on the                       
              reactivity of model complexes for dehydrosulfurization (HDS)                   
              catalysts.  Curtis will synthesize small cluster molecules                     
              consisting of two or three atoms of molybdenum, one to three                   
              atoms of a second metal, such as iron, cobalt, or nickel, and                  
              two to four atoms of sulfur.  Their structural features will be                
              examined and compared to their behavior in oxidation-reduction                 
              reactions.  Of particular interest are reactions involving                     
              abstraction of sulfur from organic molecules, particularly                     
              allyl sulfides.  Another reaction of interest involves olefins                 
              and hydrogen, since hydrogen is known to be involved in the                    
              desulfurization sequence.  Electrochemical studies, synthesis                  
              of organic molecules by desulfurization, and surface                           
              characterization of clusters when supported on alumina will                    
              also be included.                                                              
              %%%                                                                            
              Hydrodesulfurization (HDS) is an commercial process that is                    
              promoted by catalysts prepared from molybdenum, cobalt, and                    
              sulfur.  It is used to remove sulfur from organic materials and                
              is therefore important to enhancing air quality in industrial                  
              areas.  In this project, compounds which are models of the                     
              industrial catalyst will be prepared in an effort to understand                
              the reactions which occur and perhaps improve the effectivess                  
              of the catalyst.
