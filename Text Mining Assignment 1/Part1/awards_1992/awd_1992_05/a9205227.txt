Abstract    :
              The Center for Fluid Mechanics, Turbulence and Computation and                 
              the Division of Applied Mathematics at Brown University will                   
              purchase high performance, color graphics, computer equipment                  
              which will be dedicated to the support of research in the                      
              mathematical sciences.  The equipment will be used for several                 
              research projects including particular: Dynamical systems and                  
              computation, Dynamics of two-phase flow and turbulence, Markovian              
              models in vision and image processing, and Applied mathematical                
              modelling.
