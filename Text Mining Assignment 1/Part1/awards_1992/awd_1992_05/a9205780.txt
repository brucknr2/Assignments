Abstract    :
              This project focuses on the proximal products of the cataclysmic               
              phase (1982) of El Chichon Volcano which have not been studied in              
              detail before.  Specific goals are:  (1) to document the                       
              stratigraphy of the proximal deposits, (2) to determine the facies             
              distribution of various proximal flow and surge units, (3)                     
              determine the type of eruptive activity that produced the various              
              proximal units, (4) to understand the nature of transport and                  
              deposition in the proximal environment, (5) to interpret surface               
              characteristics of tephra in various bedding types by using an                 
              imaging analysis with the SEM, (6) to investigate the role of                  
              hydromagmatism, and (7) to mimic the eruptive history through 3-D              
              modelling.  The models developed will be important for mitigation              
              of volcanic risks at their similar volcanoes.
