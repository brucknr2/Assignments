Abstract    :
              As telecommunication networks become more complex, the demands for             
              capacity and data compression become more severe.  This research is            
              set up to develop a general theory of information flow in networks.            
              The networks will have arbitrary interference among the                        
              transmitters and receivers, and arbitrary noise at the receivers.              
              Such a theory would encompass hybrid communication networks                    
              consisting of fiber optics, wire and electromagnetic media.  The               
              primary attack will be to use Shannon-sense information theory,                
              thus providing the best achievable limits for distributed capacity             
              and distributed data compression.  Specific problems include                   
              progressive transmission, the sequential refinement of information             
              and the determination of the capacity region of broadcast channels             
              and multiple user channels, both with and without feedback.  Also              
              to be considered is the general question of the efficient                      
              distribution of information; thus providing guidance to problems in            
              network information theory may lead to useful heuristics for                   
              suboptimal data communication procedures when the optimal procedure            
              is judged to be practically unachievable for reasons of cost or                
              computation time.//
