Abstract    :
              The principal investigator, in collaboration with Dr. Frank Spera              
              of the University of California at Santa Barbera, will numerically             
              study several classes of problems related to dynamic evolution of              
              magma bodies. Each problem will be constrained by observations from            
              classical petrology. The ultimate goal is to better understand the             
              dynamics of magma chambers and the formation of igneous rocks.
