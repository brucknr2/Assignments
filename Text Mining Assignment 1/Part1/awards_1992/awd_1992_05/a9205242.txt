Abstract    :
              The department of mathematical sciences at the University of                   
              Delaware will                                                                  
              purchase an IBM PowerStation 550 and four Sun SPARCstation IPX                 
              workstations which will be dedicated to the support of research                
              in mathematical sciences.  The equipment will be used for several              
              research projects, including in particular:                                    
              1. The numerical solution of fluid-structure interaction problems              
              in three dimensions,                                                           
              2. A study of finite element methods for Maxwell's equations,                  
              3. The computation of viscoelastic and transonic flows,                        
              4. The numerical modeling of wave phenomena in composites,                     
              5. A study of 3D hp and p version finite elements on multilevel                
              tetrahedral meshes.
