Abstract    :
              The principal investigator, in collaboration with Dr. David Yuen               
              of the University of Minnesota, will numerically study several                 
              classes of problems related to dynamic evolution of magma bodies.              
              Each problem will be constrained by observations from classical                
              petrology. The ultimate goal is to better understand the dynamics              
              of magma chambers and the formation of igneous rocks.
