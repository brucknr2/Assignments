Abstract    :
                   Many of the problems central to earth structure and history               
              require a deeper understanding of differentiation in a convecting              
              two-phase (liquid-solid) system.  Current research indicates no                
              inconsistency between geophysical arguments favoring extensive                 
              early melting of the earth (a deep magma ocean) and geochemical                
              arguments, primarily because differentiation does not begin until              
              the system approaches the solidus (melt fraction 20%).  The PI will            
              pursue the issue of the extent to which differentiation can take               
              place at this stage and subsequently, through a comprehensive set              
              of analytical and computer model calculations, and combine these               
              with high pressure geochemical data to test the consequences                   
              against current earth structure.
