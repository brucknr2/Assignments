Abstract    :
              Evidence for delamination of the lower lithosphere under regions               
              of tectonic thickening includes rapid uplift coincident with the               
              onset of voluminous crustally-derived magmatism, sometimes                     
              accompanied by mantle-derived basalt.  Two localities in the                   
              central Andes appear to be good candidates to study magmatic rocks             
              associated with delamination:  1) the Argentine Puna Plateau in the            
              late tertiary, and 2) the Gondwana margin in the late                          
              Paleozoic-Triassic in the Chilean Frontal Cordillera.  This project            
              is to use isotopic mass tracers and trace element                              
              pressure-temperature indicators, along with geologic and                       
              geophysical constraints, to test and modify the delamination                   
              hypothesis in these two regions, as well as to characterize the                
              delaminated Andean lithospheric material, and to examine its                   
              relation to southern Hemisphere mantle heterogeneity.
