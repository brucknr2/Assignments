Abstract    :
                   The investigators will develop and implement algorithms for               
              the computer modelling of water waves, including the breaking of               
              waves.  The algorithms will be based on a boundary integral                    
              formulation together with a time-marching algorithm to advance                 
              the free boundary.  A number of new numerical techniques, never                
              before applied to water wave problems, will be used.  In                       
              particular, a new fast multilevel technique will be applied to                 
              solve the integral equations, which is the dominant part of the                
              solution process.  The investigators will write a robust and                   
              efficient computer program, which will be documented and placed                
              in the public domain for unrestricted use, e.g., by                            
              oceanographers, engineers, fluid dynamicists, and numerical                    
              analysts.  The investigators will validate the code thoroughly                 
              both through numerical testing and numerical analysis, and will                
              compare its results with laboratory experiments.                               
                   This work will improve the reliability and efficiency of                  
              computer simulations in  hydrodynamics, such as arise in the                   
              modelling of off-shore structures, movement of boats through                   
              water, and tidal energy generation.  Recent advances in computer               
              algorithms will be adapted and applied for the first time in                   
              these areas, enabling the investigators to exploit very fast                   
              computer hardware.  Through the development of a publicly                      
              available computer code this work will contribute to the transfer              
              of ideas from theoretical mathematical research to technological               
              applications.
