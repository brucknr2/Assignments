Abstract    :
                   Professor Khakoo will measure absolute differential cross                 
              sections of electron impact excitation on Helium atoms.  The                   
              excitation will populate excited levels of Helium which                        
              subsequently decay by radiation.  Coincident measurement of the                
              electron energy at fixed scattering angle together with the                    
              emitted photons will test fundamental assumptions of approximate               
              theories of electron-atom scattering at intermediate energies.
