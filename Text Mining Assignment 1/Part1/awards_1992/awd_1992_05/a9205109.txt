Abstract    :
                   This Pittsburgh project, under the direction of Professor                 
              E. Newman comprises the study of both the classical and                        
              quantum aspects of the properties of gravitational waves.  The                 
              novel feature of this study is due to a reformulation of                       
              Einstein's equations in terms of certain new, non-local                        
              variables which appear to be more adapted to the analysis of                   
              the phenomena.
