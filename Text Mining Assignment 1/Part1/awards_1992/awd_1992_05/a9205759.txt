Abstract    :
                   The proposed research centers on stochastic inequalities,                 
              including correlation inequalities, monotonicity of certain                    
              expectations with respect to parameters of distributions,                      
              inequalities which quantify dependence structures, and related                 
              notions of multivariate total positivity.  The emphasis is on                  
              multivariate distributions and processes.  The proposal also                   
              refers to dependence concepts arising in sequential analysis and               
              the study of optimal stopping value comparisons under various                  
              dependence structures, and prophet inequalities which provide                  
              upper bounds on optimal stopping values.  Limit theorems for                   
              various types of dependence structures will be studied, with                   
              initial emphasis on approximation rates.  The resulting improved               
              convergence rates may be applicable to the study of asymptotics                
              of multivariate statistics which can be expressed as sums of                   
              dependent random variables and various random counts arising in                
              problems of combinatorial nature.                                              
                   The assumptions of statistical independence of sampled                    
              measurements is basic to most methods of data analysis, and is                 
              ubiquitous in problems of stochastic optimization.  However, one               
              encounters many situations in which this assumption is violated.               
              The proposed research centers on the study of certain aspects of               
              samples which consist of observations which are not independent.
