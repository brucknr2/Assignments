Abstract    :
                     This project is to investigate aspects of the Caribbean "plate          
              buffer zone" which is a complex area of small plates wedged between            
              the much larger North and South American plates.  The island of                
              Cuba experienced compression and development of a fold and thrust              
              belt during late Cretaceous to late Eocene, an interval of rifting             
              and marine sedimentation in the Yucatan Basin, the Cayman Trough               
              and along the Nicaragua Rise.  This project will analyze samples               
              collected in Cuba in order to test a model of paired zones of                  
              divergence and convergence in the Cuban orogenic belt -- the field             
              aspects being supported by non-federal sources.  Results should                
              help clarify to what extent synchronous plate divergence and                   
              convergence has occurred in the Caribbean.
