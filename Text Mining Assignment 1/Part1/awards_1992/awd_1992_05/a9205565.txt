Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The E75 ecdysone inducible gene, believed to be a key regulator                
              of ecdysone triggered genetic hierarchies in Drosophila                        
              development, encodes three different protein products which are                
              members of the steroid receptor superfamily and which share                    
              conserved structural features corresponding to the DNA and                     
              hormone binding domains. Genetic analysis shows that these                     
              proteins carry out distinct functions at different stages of                   
              development. The E75 A protein has been localized                              
              immunocytochemically to the chromosomal sites of many ecdysone                 
              regulated genes, including E75. In functional studies, this                    
              protein has been shown to be capable of negatively regulating its              
              own promoter. The similarity of E75 sequences to the hormone                   
              binding domains of known receptor suggests that E75 is also a                  
              receptor. This hypothesis is supported by evolutionary comparison              
              and preliminary functional analysis of the putative hormone                    
              binding domain. No known steroid, thyroid, retinoid hormone or                 
              insect juvenile hormone activates the E75 proteins, suggesting                 
              that the E75 ligand is a previously unidentified hormone. In the               
              studies propose here, these observations will be extended to                   
              further define the role of the different E75 proteins and the                  
              putative E75 ligand in the regulation of gene expression and                   
              Drosophila development. Studies will be focused in three areas:                
              1) developmental genetic analysis of E75 to further define the                 
              mutant phenotypes, to understand the role of each of the E75                   
              proteins in the generation of these phenotypes and the role of                 
              different E75 domains involved in the repression and activation                
              of target genes, 2) characterization of its role in development,               
              and 3) characterization of target gene regulation by                           
              developmentally characterized E75 mutant proteins.
