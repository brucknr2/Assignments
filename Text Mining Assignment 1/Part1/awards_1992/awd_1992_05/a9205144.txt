Abstract    :
              Theoretical research will be conducted on the mesoscopic physics of            
              interference effects in conductors and superconductors.  Specific              
              projects will focus on interference effects in disordered                      
              superconductors based on the assumption that superfluid density has            
              a random sign near the superconductor-insulator transition;                    
              interference effects in hopping conductivity leading to a                      
              quantitative theory for magnetoresistance; interference and                    
              interaction effects in tunnelling density of states exploring the              
              connection between Coulomb blockade and interaction corrections to             
              the density of states in bulk metals; and, the interference                    
              mechanism for the magnetic-field dependence of the impurity hopping            
              rate in disordered metals.

              Theoretical research will be conducted on the mesoscopic properties            
              of disordered metals, superconductors and insulators.  This area of            
              research in which microscopic quantum phenomena are manifested in              
              the macroscopic world is of great fundamental importance and, at               
              the same time, is of great interest to the microelectronics                    
              industry.
