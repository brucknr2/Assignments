Abstract    :
                   This award provides partial funding for the upgrade of a                  
              Fourier Transform Infrared spectrometer system in the Department               
              of Geology and Geophysics at the University of California in                   
              Berkeley. The University is committed to providing a match of 33%              
              of the costs of the equipment for this project.                                
                   The upgrade project will consist of renovation of the source,             
              drive and electronic components of the existing system, a new                  
              microscope system for improved microsampling, and the development              
              of a novel detector design for microspectroscopy. The upgrade will             
              allow better spectroscopic characterization of phase changes and               
              properties of earth materials subjected to ultra-high pressures                
              (simulating conditions in the Earth's deep interior) during                    
              laboratory experiments inside a diamond-anvil pressure cell.
