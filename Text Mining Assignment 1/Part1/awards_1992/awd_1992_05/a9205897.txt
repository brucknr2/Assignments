Abstract    :
                   The principal investigator will study actions of non-compact              
              semistable Lie groups and their discrete subgroups on manifolds.               
              He will concentrate on the geometry and topology of these                      
              actions, and will develop techniques which will complement the                 
              measure theoretic and dynamical approaches in existence.                       
                   This award will support research in the general area of                   
              differential geometry and global analysis. Differential geometry               
              is the study of the relationship between the geometry of a space               
              and analytic concepts defined on the space. Global analysis is                 
              the study of the overall geometric and topological properties of               
              a space by piecing together local information. Applications of                 
              these areas of mathematics in other sciences include the                       
              structure of complicated molecules, liquid-gas boundaries, and                 
              the large scale structure of the universe.
