Abstract    :
              Dominant mutations in two C. elegans genes, mec-4 and deg-1, induce            
              the deaths of specific groups of neurons. Dying neurons are                    
              characterized by cell swelling and morphologically resemble a                  
              commonly observed pattern of death termed necrosis.  Because in C.             
              elegans cell death mechanisms can be dissected using genetic                   
              approaches characterization of this necrotic like death should                 
              provide novel insight into this death process.  Mec-4 and deg-1 are            
              members of a gene family that appear to encode membrane proteins.              
              These genes (called degenerin genes) mutate in the same way to                 
              induce death.  mec-4 and deg-1 DNA sequences appear to cross                   
              hybridize to DNAs from a number of species, raising  the                       
              possibility that members of gene degenerin families in other                   
              organisms might also be capable of mutation to forms that induce               
              death.  The term long objective of the research is to determine how            
              mec-4 (d) induced cell death occurs at the molecular level and to              
              investigate whether similar death mechanisms are utilized in other             
              cell types and in other organisms.  Specifically, the work outlined            
              in this proposal will 1) accomplish a structure/function analysis              
              to define domains and amino acids required for mec-4 function, 2)              
              identify suppressor mutations that block mec-4(d)-induced death to             
              identify proteins that participate in the death process, and 3)                
              isolate degenerin family members from different species.                       
              %%%                                                                            
              Elucidation of mechanisms of cell death are important for                      
              understanding development, homeostasis and pathology.
