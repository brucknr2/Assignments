Abstract    :
                   Previous research on threshold methods and extreme values is              
              in the process of being extended from the case of univariate time              
              series, to multivariate or spatial data.  This is particularly                 
              relevant in climatological research because of the need to                     
              combine data from many measuring stations.  The climatological                 
              objective is to come up with measures of trend among the                       
              crossings by a temperature series of a very high or very low                   
              threshold.  A second objective is to look at alternatives to the               
              standard models for time series.  In particular the concept of                 
              long-range dependence appears to be important in climatology, and              
              the research will explore methods of measuring this from the low-              
              frequency behavior of the periodogram.                                         
                   An important theme of current climate research is the need                
              for reliable statistical measures of greenhouse-gas-induced                    
              climate change.  Global warming would cause an increase in                     
              extreme temperatures.  This research will study the statistical                
              aspects of these extreme values, paying particular attention to                
              the problem of efficiently combining information from a number of              
              measuring stations.
