Abstract    :
              9205119  McCartney  In this project, the PI's will provide scientific leadership
              for,  and hydrographic measurements on a hydrographic section across the 
              Pacific along a latitude of about 17 degrees South.  This line was  originally
              proposed to be done in 1993, but was deferred pending  availability of both
              ship time and science funding.  It is a  contribution to the World Ocean
              Circulation Experiment (WOCE), and  is referred to as WOCE line P-21.  Many
              scientific issues crucial  to the role of the ocean in climate change will be
              addressed by the  data to be generated in this expedition.  ***
