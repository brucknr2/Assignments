Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The goal of the proposed research is to determine whether                      
              variations in the cholesterol content of plasma membranes from                 
              various cell types of the rainbow trout account for the thermal                
              adaptation of membrane function characteristic of these animals                
              (i.e., the ability of trout and other cold-blooded animals ?those              
              animals at the same temperature as their environment! to maintain              
              similar levels of membrane-related activities ?such as nutrient and            
              ion transport! at different body temperatures, even though membrane            
              structure and function are markedly perturbed by temperature), and             
              the means by which the cholesterol content of these membranes is               
              modified in response to temperature change. The results of the                 
              proposed experiments will provide a broadly applicable definition              
              of the role of cholesterol in membrane structure and function. The             
              proposed experiments will determine the effects of growth                      
              temperature on i) the plasma membrane content of cholesterol; ii)              
              the distribution of cholesterol between the plasma membrane and                
              intracellular stores; iii) the capacity for cholesterol                        
              biosynthesis in liver and intestine; and iv) rates of cholesterol              
              transport from its site of synthesis into the plasma membrane. In              
              addition, the influence of modulation in cholesterol content on                
              various membrane functions (membrane fluidity, permeability, and               
              rates of transport) will be assessed. The rainbow trout is an ideal            
              animal model in which to address these basic questions in membrane             
              biology because: 1) trout remain active and behave normally over               
              a wide range of temperatures, indicating that they acclimate well              
              to variations in temperature; 2) in marked contrast to homeotherms             
              (e.g., humans or, more generally, mammals) the membrane lipid                  
              composition can be readily manipulated in a noninvasive and                    
              physiologically meaningful context, simply by altering the water               
              temperature, thus providing a powerful tool for probing the                    
              relationships between membrane structure and function not available            
              in higher animals; and 3) the membranes of vertebrate, cold-                   
              blooded animals are more similar to those of higher vertebrates                
              with respect to both lipid composition and diversity than are those            
              of microorganisms, which have also been extensively employed to                
              study this problem.
