Abstract    :
              Import and metabolism of sucrose is essential to growth and                    
              development of non-photosynthetic cells in the vast majority of                
              plant species.  Only two enzymatic reactions can catalyze sucrose              
              breakdown; sucrose synthase or invertase.  The physiological                   
              significance of each pathway has been widely debated.  Recent                  
              advances in molecular analysis of the genes encoding these enzymes             
              have opened up exciting possibilities for resolving these issues.              
              We have previously shown that the sucrose synthase genes of maize              
              are differentially regulated by sugar availability.  Recently we               
              have been able to extend this combined molecular genetic and                   
              physiological approach to the invertase genes in maize.  A cDNA                
              clone for maize invertase and identified maize lines with genetic              
              deficiencies in invertase expression has been isolated.  In                    
              particular, we have focused a maize genotype that specifically                 
              lacks invertase activity in the primary root system, leaving the               
              whole plant free from direct effects of the deficiency.  These                 
              proposed experiments will: 1) Characterize a pair of maize                     
              invertase genes - their structure, expression, and physilogical                
              function, 2) Determine the genetic basis and physiological                     
              consequences of a primary root invertase deficiency in maize, 3)               
              Test the effects of double and triple mutant combinations of                   
              sucrose synthase and invertase deficiencies.
