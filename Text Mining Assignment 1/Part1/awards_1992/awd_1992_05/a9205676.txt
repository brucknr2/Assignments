Abstract    :
                   This award provides funding for the development of a laser                
              probe source to be used in conjunction with an inductively-coupled             
              plasma mass spectrometer system (ICP-MS) for applications in the               
              earth sciences. A new ICP-MS unit, renovated laboratory in which               
              to house it, and technical support staff are being provided by the             
              University of Arizona. The laser probe will be developed in the                
              University of Arizona's Department of Geosciences.                             
                   ICP-MS is currently utilized in earth sciences research as a              
              rapid and accurate method of quantitative bulk analysis for rock               
              and mineral samples which must first be put in solution phase                  
              before being introduced into the plasma flow to the mass                       
              spectrometer unit. The development of a small diameter laser beam              
              source that would directly ablate solid samples will provide an                
              extremely powerful method of in situ microanalysis with good                   
              spatial resolution of less than 100 microns.
