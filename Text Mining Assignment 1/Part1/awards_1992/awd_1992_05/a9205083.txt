Abstract    :
                     Average plate velocities for many of the large plates have              
              been known for sometime based on radiometric dates of magnetic                 
              strips on the seafloor.  Recently, work has indicated that plate               
              velocities may vary in concert on geologically brief time scales               
              without violating plate circuit closure requirements.  This project            
              will test this idea by combining available marine data on seafloor             
              topography, magnetic and geochronologic information for the east               
              Pacific basin.  Results should indicate if short-interval plate                
              velocity changes are real, and if so should help to determine the              
              causative factors.
