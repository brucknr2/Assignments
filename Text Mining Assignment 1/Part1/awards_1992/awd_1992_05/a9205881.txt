Abstract    :
                   Nonparametric statistical methods will be developed for                   
              spatial data arising from random fields and point processes.  A                
              nonparametric approach is appealing for analyzing spatial data                 
              because it avoids detailed assumptions about the typically                     
              unknown and usually complicated underlying probability structure               
              in terms of marginal distributions of the observations or shapes               
              of spatial boundaries that partition the observations into                     
              homogeneous groups.  Two specific types of nonparametric methods               
              will be developed: resampling methods, which describe the                      
              sampling distribution of a general statistic computed from                     
              spatial data; and boundary estimators, which separate                          
              nonhomogeneous spatial data into homogeneous subsets.                          
                   Spatial data is data that is laid out on a map or grid; it                
              arises naturally in geology, ecology, meteorology, agriculture,                
              epidemiology, medical imaging and other areas of scientific                    
              investigation.  Often there is a natural boundary running through              
              spatial data such as a seismic fault line or the edge of an                    
              object in an image.  One goal of this project is to develop                    
              methods for identifying such boundaries accurately; another is to              
              develop methods for assessing the sampling error in quantities                 
              calculated from spatial data.
