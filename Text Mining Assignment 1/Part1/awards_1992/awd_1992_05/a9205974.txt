Abstract    :
                   This award provides one-half the funding needed to acquire a              
              modern ratio mass spectrometer that will be installed and operated             
              in the Department of Geology and Geophysics at the University of               
              Utah. The University of Utah is committed to providing the                     
              remaining funds necessary for this purchase.                                   
                   The new mass spectrometer will replace a fourteen-year old                
              spectrometer which is obsolete and does not provide the analytical             
              capabilities to solve modern research problems. Specifically, the              
              new spectrometer system will allow the analysis of very small gas              
              samples, a feature required by a growing number of research                    
              projects undertaken by the Principal Investigator, colleagues, and             
              students at the University of Utah.
