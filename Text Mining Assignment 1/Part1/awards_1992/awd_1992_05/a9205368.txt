Abstract    :
                This research is to study the seismic velocities and, by                     
              inference, the dynamical processes occurring within D", the base               
              of the mantle just above the core-mantle boundary.  Diffracted P               
              and S waves and core phases will be used as recorded on digital                
              broad-band seismometers.  Many processes that occur within the                 
              earth - convection, hot spot generation, geomagnetic field                     
              production, cooling of the core -would be much better understood               
              if we had improved resolution of D", the thermal and/or chemical               
              boundary layer at the base of the mantle.  It is the aim of this               
              project to achieve this resolution, and in doing so, knowledge of              
              deep earth dynamics.
