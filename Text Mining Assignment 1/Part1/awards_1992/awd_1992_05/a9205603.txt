Abstract    :
                   The PI will continue exploration of field behavior as recorded            
              in Matuyama-aged volcanics from the Hawaii, Society Island and                 
              Reunion hotspots and others currently under investigation.  In                 
              various stages of completion are studies of six transition zones               
              corresponding to events which bound the Olduvai and Reunion                    
              subchrons recorded on the islands of Molokai, Moorea and Reunion.              
              For each investigation, he will conduct complete-vector studies                
              utilizing, in particular new-refined multi-specimen approach to                
              absolute paleointensity.  In order to ascertain with certainty the             
              actual reversals involved,m he will also obtain radiometric ages               
              for each thus far undated section.
