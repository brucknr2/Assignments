Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This scanning probe microscope will have both tunneling and                    
              scanning force heads and will be used for nanometer scale                      
              characterization of materials including solids, fractured                      
              materials, solid-fluid and solid-solid interfaces.  The goal of                
              the research projects for which it will be used is to measure                  
              both structure and electronic properties on the nanometer scale.               
              This project is part of a research effort in the Washington State              
              University Center for Materials Research which is focusing on the              
              microstructural and microchemical properties of materials.                     
              Researchers from the departments of chemistry, physics, and                    
              mechanical and materials engineering departments will make use of              
              this instrument.  Initial experiments include (a) determination                
              of nanostructure of thin films of metal nitrides, carbides,                    
              ferroelectric oxides, grown by ion beam enhanced techniques and                
              by laser ablation; (b) observation of fracture and deformation                 
              induced features and structures, particularly in insulating                    
              materials, on an atomic scale -- including dislocation                         
              arrangements and the structure of interfaces; (c) studies of                   
              laser ablation of solid surfaces; and (d) determination of                     
              electronic properties of heterogeneous surface structures using                
              scanning tunneling spectroscopy.
