Abstract    :
              This award from the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic                 
              Chemistry Program is for partial support of a conference on                    
              bioinorganic copper chemistry.  The funds will be used to                      
              reduce the registration fee of graduate student and post-                      
              doctoral to one half that of other conferees.  This conference                 
              will bring together participants from the inorganic and                        
              biological chemistry communities to discuss the most recent                    
              discoveries concerning the chemistry of copper in biological                   
              systems.  Attendence of such conferences by junior researchers                 
              can provide significant enhancement to their education and a                   
              boost to their careers as independent scientists.
