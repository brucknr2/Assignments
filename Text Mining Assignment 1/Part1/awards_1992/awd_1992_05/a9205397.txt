Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Small animals move their limbs at higher frequencies than animals              
              and it costs more energy per gram for a small animal to move a                 
              given distance than for than for a large one. The questions we                 
              address in the grant is the muscular system designed to permit much            
              more energy for small animals to run than large ones?                          
                                                                                             
              It has been hypothesized that the underlying mechanisms lies in the            
              properties of the muscle fibers. The fibers of the small animals               
              are thought to have maximum velocity of shortening (Vmax) which                
              enables them to shorten faster and generate force and relax faster-            
              -a necessity  for the high frequencies aty which they run. But                 
              there is a price: fibers with high V(max's) use far more energy to             
              generate force, thus potentially explaining why it is more costly              
              for small animals to run.                                                      
                                                                                             
              With the new techniques that we have developed, we will test the               
              above hypothesis by measuring how V(max) and the energetic cost of             
              generating force of different fiber types scales with body size in             
              mammals ranging from mice to horses.
