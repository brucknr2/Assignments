Abstract    :
                This research is to study the lithospheric structure and active              
              tectonics of the Atlas mountain system in Morocco.  Data produced              
              by a recently installed modern, telemetered, digital seismic                   
              network in a joint effort by Cornell University and institutes in              
              Morocco will be used in the effort.  The Atlas mountain belt is                
              an active transpressive system with abundant active folding and                
              thrust and strike-slip faulting.  Its evolution and structure is               
              fundamentally different from that of most mountain belts located               
              along convergent plate boundaries, such as the Himalayas, Zagros,              
              Andes, and Alps.  Different lithospheric models will be tested by              
              seismic and gravity data to explain an apparent excess of mass                 
              beneath the Atlas mountains.  This research is a component of the              
              National Earthquake Hazard Reduction Program.
