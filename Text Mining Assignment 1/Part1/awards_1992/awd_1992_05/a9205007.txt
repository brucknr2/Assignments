Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The goals of this project are (1) to learn molecular mechanisms of             
              temperature acclimation, specifically protein synthesis, and (2) to            
              examine differences in patterns of cellular compensation for                   
              temperature change between cultured hepatocytes and liver in vivo.             
              Techniques to used include: (1) quantitative changes in specific               
              protein concentrations by rocket immunophoresis (RIE) and enzyme               
              linked immunoabsorbant assay (ELISA); (2) quantitative changes in              
              activities, on both protein and DNA bases, of enzymes that we have             
              found to show varying amounts of temperature compensation, (3)                 
              isozymal changes by gel electrophoresis, (4) identification of                 
              relative roles of transcription and translation in temperature-                
              induced protein synthesis, and (5) estimation of hormonal action on            
              acclimation of cultures hepatocytes and thus to note the validity              
              of tissue culture for in vivo physiology. This research will add               
              significantly to our understanding of adaptation of fishes to                  
              changes in temperature.
