Abstract    :
              Bacteria contain numerous genes and complex regulatory                         
              systems that are necessary for survival in nature, but are                     
              not required for growth under controlled conditions in a                       
              bioreactor.  The inherent complexity of bacteria makes                         
              bioprocess development unpredictable and modeling of                           
              bacterial growth and metabolism difficult.  The goal of this                   
              project is to reduce the complexity of Escherichia coli, the                   
              best understood bacterium and one of industrial importance.                    
              This will be carried out by selective deletions of the                         
              genome of the bacterium.  Successful deletions will be those                   
              that allow normal growth on a defined medium.
