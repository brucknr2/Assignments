Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The proposed research will (a) develop theory linking the                      
              responses of individuals to spatial variation in population and                
              ecosystem dynamics; (b) test such theory by experimental field                 
              studies and simulation modeling; (c) determine how ecological                  
              features vary with spatial scale and whether "rules" can be                    
              defined for extrapolating among scales; and (d) extend this work               
              to systems composed of tropically linked species.  The field                   
              research, conducted in a semiarid grassland ecosystem, will                    
              involve experimental studies of responses of tenebrionid beetles               
              to the spatial structure of "microlandscapes" and to variations in             
              spatial patterns at broader scales.  Individual movement patterns              
              at fine scales will be coupled with long-distance movements to                 
              determine how individual behavior translates into population                   
              distribution.  Experiments with harvester ants will be used to                 
              determine how the removal and transport of seeds are affected by               
              the spatial structure of ecosystems.  Scaling relationships among              
              linked trophic levels will be investigated using horned lizard-ant             
              and longspur-grasshopper systems.  The research bears directly on              
              current issues in ecological scaling and extrapolation, flows of               
              materials across patch boundaries, empirical testing of spatial                
              models, and the development of an experimental and theoretical                 
              approach to landscape ecology.
