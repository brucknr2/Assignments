Abstract    :
                   The proposed research will use comparative evidence from the              
              ontogeny of flowers to address phylogeny of legumes.  Polarization             
              methods will use outgroup comparison.  Preliminary trees based on              
              33 taxa representing major tribes of the three subfamilies of                  
              Leguminosae and 30 traditional characters from mature flower and               
              vegetative structure were developed for comparative purposes.  To              
              date, 17 qualitative ontogenetic characters with discrete character            
              states have been derived based on direct observation of floral                 
              ontogenies with SEM; most are heterochronic.  Preliminary results              
              show some unexpected relationships among tribes and subfamilies                
              that need to be assessed in terms of characters used: i.e.,                    
              caesalpinioids Gleditsia and Ceratonia are a basal sister group to             
              the rest of the legumes; and Caesalpiniodeae appears non-                      
              monophyletic.  The research will also test the hypothesis that                 
              specialized character states are first expressed late in floral                
              ontogeny, using species of Sophora, a papilionoid with diverse                 
              pollinators.  In addition, presumably different development                    
              pathways leading to convergent floral structure will be documented             
              in three caesalpinioid genera (Cassia s. str., Chamaecrista, Senna)            
              that are strikingly alike in specialized character states.
