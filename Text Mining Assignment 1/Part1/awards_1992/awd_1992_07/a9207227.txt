              This grant addresses making and                                                
              characterizing composite materials                                             
              of metal fractal clusters that are                                             
              embedded in a polymer host with the                                            
              goal of investigating the                                                      
              possibility of making organic

              susceptibilities.  Owing to the                                                
              large enhancement in the local

              of such clusters.  We propose to use

              maximized local fields.  Owing to a                                            
              polymer's ease of processing, we
