Abstract    :
              In this project in the Physical Chemistry Program of the                       
              Chemistry Division, Bruce Hudson will study the UV resonance                   
              Raman spectra of a broad range of conjugated and non-conjugated                
              polyenes and selected triatomics.  Information about                           
              vibrational and electronic ground and excited states to be                     
              gathered will be related to the mechanism of nuclear/electron                  
              coupling in molecules in processes such as photodissociation,                  
              photoisomerization, and unimolecular reaction.  Experimental                   
              methods involving the determination of absolute Raman                          
              intensities, depolarization ratio dispersion, tunable                          
              excitation, and photochemical generation of subject species in                 
              vapor and with matrix isolation will be developed.  A new UV                   
              spectrograph will be constructed and a Ti:sapphire laser will                  
              be developed to produce tunable far-uv radiation.

              Professor Hudson's research group has developed unique                         
              spectroscopic capabilities that allow the study of the initial                 
              motion of a molecule which has been excited by a vacuum-                       
              ultraviolet photon from its ground electronic energy state.                    
              Experiments using these techniques can make important                          
              contributions to the understanding of energy flow and                          
              intramolecular dynamics in the highly excited states of                        
              polyatomic molecules.
