Abstract    :
                   The 1992 Theoretical Advanced Study Institute (TASI-92)                   
              will be held during June 1992 at the University of Colorado.                   
              This Study Institute will provide a series of lectures and                     
              seminars, aimed at advanced graduate students, on current                      
              topics in theoretical elementary particle physics and related                  
              experimental subjects.  These topics will include the string                   
              theory of the basic forces, quantum field theory, the                          
              "standard model" of elementary particle physics, black holes,                  
              and astrophysical structure formation.  These topics are very                  
              important and timely, and TASI-92 will provide its students an                 
              invaluable opportunity to learn about advanced subjects and                    
              recent developments from experts.
