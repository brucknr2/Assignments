Abstract    :
              The objective of this study is to further verify the feasibility               
              of applying breakout geometry to underground excavation in real                
              rocks. a large scale polyaxial testing machine will be used in                 
              order to eliminate all boundary effects on the measured                        
              excavation response . A Finite Element code, capable of elasto-                
              plastic analysis, will be used in order to numerically model the               
              breakout phenomenon and determine the strength of various                      
              excavation geometries. The numerical model will also be used for               
              generation of database which would contain the most stable                     
              excavation geometries under different stress conditions and for                
              various rock types. These data will provide guidelines in real                 
              practice for modification or design of Tunnel Boring Machines                  
              (TBM).
