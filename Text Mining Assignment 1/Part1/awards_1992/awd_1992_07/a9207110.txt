Abstract    :
                   The PI proposes to study the heating of the solar corona by               
              observing the coronal oscillation spectrum at the total solar                  
              eclipse of 3 November 1994, a favorable solar eclipse in terms of              
              duration, sky clarity, and weather forecasts. The observations                 
              provide tests of a mechanism to explain the heating of the solar               
              corona via Alfven waves. The heating takes place in the region of              
              formation of the solar wind. Prior observations we made at the                 
              total solar eclipses of 1980 and 1983 indicate excess power in the             
              Fourier transforms between 0.5 and 2 Hz. The expedition was clouded            
              out of the observing the 1 July 1991 total solar eclipse. The                  
              proposed new experiment improves on the prior observations in a                
              variety of ways, including improved digitization and data                      
              recording, improved image acquisition during the brief period of               
              totality, and a major expansion of the frequency range under                   
              observation through greatly improved tracking.                                 
                   Studies of the solar corona at eclipses have been a major part            
              of the success of the Astronomy Department at Williams College in              
              attracting and training students. Undergraduate students have been             
              intimately connected with our prior eclipse expeditions and the                
              associated data reduction and analysis, and this proposal will                 
              enable the PI to continue the active involvement of students.
