Abstract    :
                   This award supports research on two topics in commutative                 
              algebra.  The first is concerned with excellent rings, formal                  
              fibres and the relationship between certain prime ideals of the                
              generic formal fibre of an excellent local domain R and some                   
              birational extensions of R.  The second is related to a                        
              conjecture by Lech concerning the behavior of the Hilbert                      
              function under faithfully flat morphisms of local noetherian                   
              rings.                                                                         
                   This is research in the field of algebraic geometry, one of               
              the oldest parts of modern mathematics, but one which has had a                
              revolutionary flowering in the past quarter-century.  In its                   
              origins, it treated figures that could be defined in the plane by              
              the simplest equations, namely polynomials.  Nowadays, the field               
              makes use of methods not only from algebra, but from analysis and              
              topology, and conversely is finding application in those fields                
              as well as in theoretical computer science and robotics.
