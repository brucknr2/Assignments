Abstract    :
                   The influence of tropical squall lines on weather ranging from            
              local to global is now being recognized by the meteorological                  
              community.  Accordingly, observational studies that have focussed              
              on tropical squall lines have been held off the north coast of                 
              Australia in recent years.  The Principal Investigator will                    
              capitalize on already collected data by using a three dimensional              
              cloud model to investigate the vertical latent heating profile of              
              deep precipitating tropical mesoscale convective systems.                      
                   Several considerations lend significance to a modeling study              
              of latent heat release in tropical squall lines in this area.  For             
              instance:                                                                      
                o  Tropical convective latent heat release strongly influences               
              both local rainfall and synoptic to global circulation features                
              such as the Walker cell, a zonal arm of the global circulation over            
              the tropical Pacific, with convection over northern Australia and              
              the neighboring maritime continent normally forming the upward                 
              branch;                                                                        
                o  The Darwin area is uniquely equipped, both in geographical                
              location and in coverage by radars and rawinsondes, for close                  
              observation of the convection that feeds the Walker cell;                      
                o  Darwin area squall lines occur in a wide variety of kinematic             
              and thermodynamic environments, in terms of available buoyant                  
              energy and low-level wind shear as well as other potentially                   
              important modulators of convective mode.
