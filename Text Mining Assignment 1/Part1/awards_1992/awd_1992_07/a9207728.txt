Abstract    :
                   Professor Katok will work on several problems connected with              
              automorphic forms.  In particular, she will study the Fourier                  
              coefficients of non-holomorphic Maass forms.  She will also study              
              a generalization of Livshitz theory through the development of a               
              higher cohomology theory for hyperbolic dynamical systems.                     
                   Automorphic forms arose out of non-Euclidean geometry in the              
              middle of the nineteenth century.  Both mathematicians and                     
              physicists have thus long realized that many objects of                        
              fundamental importance are non-Euclidean in their basic nature.                
              This field is principally concerned with questions about the                   
              whole numbers, but in its use of geometry and analysis, it                     
              retains connection to its historical roots and thus to problems                
              in areas as diverse as gauge theory in theoretical physics and                 
              coding theory in information theory.
