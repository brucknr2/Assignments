Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This project supports the research of a cultural anthropologist                
              comparing household energy use in two comparable communities: a                
              small city in Sweden and one in Minnesota.  The investigator will              
              reside for six months in each town to gather quantitative and                  
              qualitative information through participant observation,                       
              community-wide surveys, and in-depth interviews with household                 
              members and utility company personnel, government officials, and               
              other public and private officials.  The research will update and              
              extend a study done by the investigator in 1980-82 which showed                
              that technology was more influential than behavioral values in                 
              causing Sweden's lower per capita energy demand.  The hypothesis               
              is that behavioral variables such as concern for the environment               
              as well as rising energy prices will have increased the                        
              importance of behavioral causes of energy conservation.                        
                                                                                             
              This project is important because energy conservation can not be               
              achieved by technical means alone.  Understanding how households               
              manage their energy consumption is a key factor in reducing the                
              U.S.' historically high expenditures on energy consumption.                    
              Comparative case studies such as this one will provide crucial                 
              in-depth understanding of why people make the energy use                       
              decisions.
