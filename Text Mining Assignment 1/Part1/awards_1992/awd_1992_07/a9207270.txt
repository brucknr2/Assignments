Abstract    :
              In this project, the PI will obtain measurements of upper ocean                
              velocity structure, using an Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler                 
              (ADCP), along five hydrographic lines during 1992-1993, as part                
              of the World Ocean Circulation Experiment (WOCE).  The five lines              
              are designated by WOCE as P-13, 16S, 17S, 17E, and 19.  P-13 is                
              scheduled for August, 1992, with the remainder starting in                     
              October, 1992.  The direct velocity measurements will provide                  
              reference velocities against which to compare those derived from               
              hydrography, and to determine the small-scale, high-frequency                  
              variability.  Also proposed is further testing of a lowered ADCP               
              for use on hydrographic casts.
