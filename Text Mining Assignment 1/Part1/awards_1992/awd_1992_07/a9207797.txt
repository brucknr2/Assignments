Abstract    :
              Computational Complexity is a modern discipline which analyzes                 
              the inherent difficulty of a given task.  A great deal of                      
              progress has been made in classifying the time and space                       
              requirements of certain combinatorial problems.  The                           
              complexity classes L, NL, P, NP-logarithmic space,                             
              nondeterministic logarithmic space, polynomial time,                           
              nondeterministic polynomial time, respectively-have been                       
              studied extensively.  Nonetheless little is known about the                    
              comparative strengths of different resources-it is yet to be                   
              proved that the above classes are not all identical.                           
                                                                                             
              These classes will be studied from a mathematical viewpoint,                   
              and have examined the inherent difficulties of expressing                      
              conditions and shown that a robust alternate view of                           
              complexity ensues.  The computational complexity of a property                 
              is closely tied to the complexity of expressing the property                   
              in first-order logic, and a series of languages have been                      
              introduced which express exactly those properties checkable in                 
              a series of computational complexity classes.  The existence                   
              of such natural languages for each important complexity class                  
              sheds a new light on complexity theory.  These languages                       
              reaffirm the importance of the complexity classes as much more                 
              than machine dependent issues.                                                 
                                                                                             
              The research will concentrate on the following specific                        
              proposals:  (1) Order-Independent Languages, (2) First-Order                   
              Interpretations, (3) Applications to Databases and Incremental                 
              Complexity, and (4) Tradeoffs in Descriptive Complexity.
