Abstract    :
                   The principal investigator will study a class of reaction-                
              diffusion systems that model reactive, transport and diffusive                 
              phenomena.  Such models arise in a variety of physical settings,               
              including chemical processing, population biology, semiconductor               
              theory, contaminant transport, geological modelling, reservoir                 
              flow, combustion theory  and oncology.                                         
                   The investigation of the long term behavior of solutions and              
              the formation of stable spatial patterns through boundary feeds                
              is physically realistic and will lead to increased understanding               
              of the development of spatial patterns in chemical models.
