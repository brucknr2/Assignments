Abstract    :
                   Professor Wieman will use novel techniques of atomic optical              
              cooling and trapping to measure parity nonconservation in                      
              radioactive isotopes of the alkali atoms, cesium and francium.                 
              The electron-quark neutral current coupling constants which are                
              measured in atomic parity nonconservation are different from                   
              those probed in other precision electroweak measurements, this                 
              test is uniquely sensitivity to a variety of new physics which                 
              may exist beyond the standard model.
