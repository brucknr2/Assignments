Abstract    :
              Polymorphism refers to the occurrence of several different                     
              discontinuous forms within a single interbreeding population, and              
              frequently involves color.  A number of mechanisms have been                   
              advanced to explain the occurrence of such polymorphisms, yet the              
              explanations are seldom conclusive.  The proposal here focuses on              
              the fact that polymorphism frequently appear in an intermittent                
              fashion among representatives of any given lineage.  The study                 
              focuses on the Hawaiian spider Theridion grallator which                       
              demonstrates a highly visible state of polymorphism.  The pattern              
              of inheritance of the polymorphism in T. grallator will be examined            
              in order to determine:  (1) why different populations appear to                
              exhibit modes of inheritance of the polymorphism; and (2) whether              
              the observed superficial similarities between T. grallator and                 
              Enoplognatha ovata, a distantly related species, have a similar                
              mechanism of inheritance.  The study will then examine the                     
              distribution of such similar color polymorphism within the spider              
              lineage, and assesses whether similarities among unrelated                     
              representatives of the lineage are repeated independent                        
              evolutionary events or parallel evolution.  Elucidation of the                 
              mechanisms underlying the intermittent and widespread occurrence of            
              polymorphism in both natural and applied systems will contribute to            
              the knowledge of how selection operates.
