Abstract    :
              This project promises to make a contribution to a newly                        
              developing area of science and values studies:  interpretative                 
              studies of science-as-presented in public domains.  The                        
              investigator will undertake an ethnographic study of the Bradbury              
              Science Museum, located at the Los Alamos National Laboratory in               
              New Mexico.  Los Alamos is a principal site in the history of                  
              nuclear science and weapons.  The Bradbury Museum is charged with              
              preserving that history, and furthering public understanding of                
              how science figures in U.S. defense and energy policies.                       
              Traditional studies of science communication adopt positivist                  
              methods to "measure" visitor behavior, attitudes and learning.                 
              Alternately, this study uses participant-observation and informal              
              interviewing to study the experiences and activities of Museum                 
              personnel and visitors as they interpret nuclear history.  This                
              data can contribute to revisionist theories of science and museum              
              communication that emphasize the rhetorical dimensions of                      
              "texts," and the complex, active nature of science learners.  It               
              also provides insight into the cultural experience of nuclear                  
              history in the emerging, post-Cold War era.  The Bradbury Museum               
              is a site where multiple meanings for the institutions and                     
              legacies of nuclear science are promoted, accommodated, and                    
              challenged.  This investigation occurs as the Museum is planning               
              to relocate to a new, downtown Los Alamos site, which adds                     
              important historical as well as transitional dimensions to this                
              research.
