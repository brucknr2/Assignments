Abstract    :
                   The eventual goal of Quinn's program is to develop invariants             
              of smooth compact 4-manifolds which, for example, could detect                 
              counterexamples to the smooth 4-dimensional Poincare conjecture.               
              The first part of the program (this project) will be devoted                   
              primarily to study of a model problem, the Andrews-Curtis                      
              conjecture on 2-complexes.  The invariants under consideration are             
              "topological quantum field theories" in the sense of Atiyah and                
              Witten.                                                                        
                   The Poincare conjecture asserts that any manifold that has                
              certain simple topological properties in common with a topological             
              sphere must actually be a topological sphere.  It was originally               
              stated for three-dimensional manifolds around the turn of the                  
              century and subsequently generalized to all higher dimensions.                 
              Curiously, all these generalizations have now been settled (in the             
              affirmative), but the original case for three-dimensional spheres              
              still resists all assaults.  The foregoing remarks apply to                    
              topological manifolds.  The situation is slightly different for                
              smooth manifolds.  Here both the three- and the four-dimensional               
              versions of the Poincare conjecture remain open.  What Quinn is                
              hoping to do is to settle the four-dimensional case, using methods             
              inspired by a mathematical formulation of quantum field theory.
