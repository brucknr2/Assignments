Abstract    :
                   The dicotyledonous angiosperm family Cactaceae (the Cactus                
              Family) will be examined for systematically-useful variation in the            
              chloroplast genome.  DNA samples of representative taxa from                   
              throughout the family will be analyzed for gene sequence variation             
              in the chloroplast-encoded gene for ribulose bisphosphate                      
              carboxylase large subunit (rbcL).  Studies of gene sequence                    
              variation will be used to address long-standing questions about the            
              phylogenetic relationships within the family at the subfamilial and            
              tribal levels, as well as to assess monophyly of previously                    
              proposed taxonomic groups.  Data derived from rbcL gene sequencing             
              will be integrated with morphological data obtained from                       
              comparative studies of structural characters such as those of                  
              spines, flowers, fruits, and seeds, and will be analyzed to develop            
              hypotheses about the relationships within and between subfamilies              
              of the Cactaceae, and within the tribes of the subfamilies                     
              Cactoideae and Opuntioideae.  Cladistic analysis of DNA data                   
              together with morphological data will provide additional                       
              information from which inferences may be made to assist in                     
              understanding the complex phylogeny, morphological diversification,            
              and biogeographic radiation of the cacti.
