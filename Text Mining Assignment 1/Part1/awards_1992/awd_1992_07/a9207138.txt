Abstract    :
                   This grant will support research which addresses the                      
              interest generated in the field of cosmic ray physics by                       
              reports of point sources - possibly neutron stars in space -                   
              of Ultra High Energy (UHE) gamma rays detected by conventional                 
              ground based Extensive Air Shower (EAS) arrays.  The                           
              investigator plans measurements of the distribution of gamma                   
              rays from space.  He will work at the University of Notre Dame                 
              with two postdoctoral associates and a team of graduate and                    
              undergraduate students.                                                        
                   The array uses a new concept involving position sensitive                 
              detectors which, it is claimed, provides superior angular                      
              resolution by directly measuring individual angles of the                      
              charged secondaries in the air showers.  This array "Gamma Ray                 
              Astronomy at Notre Dame" (GRAND) consists of 16 stations.                      
              Each station is made up of eight planes, each with area 1.25                   
              square meters, of position sensitive detectors spaced                          
              vertically.  The bottom two planes are separated from the top                  
              six by a thin steel absorber used to distinguish muons from                    
              electrons or soft secondary photons.  Crucial features of the                  
              array then are smaller angular resolution and good muon,                       
              electron and soft photon identification.
