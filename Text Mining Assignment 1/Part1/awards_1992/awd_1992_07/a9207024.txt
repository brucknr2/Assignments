Abstract    :
              9207024  Peralta    This project studies complexity of interactive proofs and 
              involves substantial work in computational number theory and  combinatorics. 
              This supplement will upgrade the workstation  used in the project, removing
              memory limitations that limit  exploration of new research ideas.  ***
