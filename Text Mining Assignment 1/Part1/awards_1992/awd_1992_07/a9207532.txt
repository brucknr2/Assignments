Abstract    :
              This research extends understanding of particle erosion-corrosion              
              processes to metal alloy systems based on nickel, cobalt and iron.             
              A wide variety of erosive conditions of particle loading, velocity,            
              angle of incidence, and temperature are employed in the experiments            
              in controlled gaseous environments.  Mechanisms of deformation and             
              heat evolution at the specimen surface are analyzed.  Of particular            
              interest is the possible development of concentration gradients                
              near the alloy surface, internal oxidation, and extensive transient            
              oxidation, all of which can contribute strongly to the failure of              
              the alloys to form protective oxide layers.                                    
              %%%                                                                            
              Erosion-corrosion processes are responsible for serious material               
              degradation in a wide range of industrial processes, including gas             
              turbines and coal gasifiers.  This research should aid in the                  
              design of alloys that resist this type of degradation.
