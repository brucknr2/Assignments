Abstract    :
              The objective of the project is to obtain sufficient knowledge of              
              the pathway(s) for the biosynthesis of indole-3-acetic acid (IAA)              
              and the mechanisms for the interconversion of free and bound IAA               
              to understand how the plant controls its endogenous level of growth            
              hormone.  An in vitro enzymatic system has been developed for the              
              synthesis of IAA and tryptophan from indole at a rate commensurate             
              with the in vivo rate.  The system is sufficiently stable to permit            
              enzyme fractionation and characterization.  The enzyme that                    
              catalyzes the first step in the biosynthesis of the conjugates of              
              IAA has been purified to homogeneity.  The gene for the enzyme has             
              been cloned in E. coli.  This gene will be sequenced for comparison            
              with genes for other auxin binding proteins and other enzymes of               
              auxin metabolism.  These results should facilitate the isolation               
              of enzymes of auxin metabolism, permit studies of the genetic                  
              regulation of the auxin conjugation system, and ultimately permit              
              development of anti-sense techniques to further understand the role            
              of the auxin conjugation-hydrolysis system.
