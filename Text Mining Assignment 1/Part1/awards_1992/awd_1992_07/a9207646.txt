Abstract    :
              Comparative data on spermatogenesis spanning a range of                        
              pteridophytes will be collected.  Emphasis will be placed on                   
              elucidating the ultrastructural details of spermiogenesis and the              
              fine structure of the mature sperm cell.  The role of three                    
              cytoskeletal elements - microtubules, actin and centrin - in the               
              differentiation process will be evaluated by fluorescent                       
              labelling and immunogold-localization.  These data will be                     
              compared with data already available on the bryophytes.  Both                  
              taxa of spermatophytes that have flagellated sperm and two                     
              species of charaphytes will also be examined.  The bryophytes,                 
              algae, and seed plants will be used as outgroups in a cladistic                
              analysis of the data.  The purpose of this study is resolve                    
              phylogenetic relationships among early pteridophytes and between               
              them and the algal, bryophyte and seed plant lineages.  The major              
              dichotomies in early diversification of archegoniate groups                    
              remain as speculative today as they did before the advent of                   
              biological electron microscopy.    This study should enable the                
              resolution of early lines of diversification from the green algae              
              to the major extant groups of land plants.
