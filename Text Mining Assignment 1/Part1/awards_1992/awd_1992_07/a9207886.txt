Abstract    :
              In this project in the Physical Chemistry Program of the                       
              Chemistry Division, Prof. Paul N. Schatz will study the                        
              magnetooptical spectroscopy of large polyatomic systems, such                  
              as fullerenes and porphyrins, in low-temperature noble gas                     
              matrices.   Prof. Schatz expects to obtain basic electronic                    
              structural information about the ground and excited states of                  
              molecular, ionic, mixed-valent, and radical species using                      
              magnetic circular dichroism and magnetic circularly polarized                  
              luminescence spectroscopies and their zero-field counterparts.                 
              He will also perform theoretical analyses to fit the spectra in                
              order to obtain spectroscopic parameters for these systems.                    
              %%%                                                                            
              By studying the spectroscopy of atoms, molecules, radicals, and                
              their respective ions captured in very cold matrices consisting                
              of solids made from noble-gas atoms, scientists can learn much                 
              about their molecular structure and other important properties.                
              Prof. Schatz will use magnetic fields and polarized light to                   
              aid him in understanding the electronic spectra of several                     
              chemically interesting species and to acquire information which                
              can not be obtained any other way.  Among the most interesting                 
              are fullerene compounds (molecules made exclusively from carbon                
              atoms arranged in closed geometric solids) and their positive                  
              and negative ions as well as porphyrin systems.  The former                    
              compounds are relevant to materials science because of recent                  
              applications to areas such as high-temperature                                 
              superconductivity.  The latter are important to bioinorganic                   
              chemistry and have relevance to a number of biological sytems.
