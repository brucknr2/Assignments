Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This research will apply molecular template techniques in concert              
              with probe microscopy to the chemical synthesis and ordering of                
              oligomeric and polymeric materials for electronic and photonic                 
              applications.  There are three distinct tasks within the research.             
              First is the study of synthetic reactions initiated by a confined              
              electric discharge between a probe tip and substrate.  Second is               
              the development of procedures for orienting a single conducting                
              oligomer between sharp probe tips by chemical insertion and                    
              binding.  Third is the investigation of single-layer ledges on                 
              highly-ordered pyrolytic graphite as chemical templates of                     
              opportunity for the growth of highly ordered one-dimensional                   
              polymers.
