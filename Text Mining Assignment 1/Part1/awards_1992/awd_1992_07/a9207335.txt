Abstract    :
                   The spiders of the world are a diverse and ecologically                   
              important group of organisms, living in nearly all terrestrial                 
              habitats and constituting significant predators in these                       
              communities.  Taxonomically they are disposed into 105 families,               
              and one of the largest and most comprehensive collections of spider            
              specimens is housed at the American Museum of Natural History.                 
              Researchers there are employing modern molecular methods to conduct            
              DNA sequencing of targeted genes, to gain data useful in the                   
              phylogenetic analysis of evolutionary relationships among these                
              families and with potential arthropod relatives.  Target loci                  
              include the 18S ribosomal genes, the histone H4 genes, and the                 
              nuclear ubiquitin genes.  Morphological characters also are being              
              studied and are to be integrated with the molecular results in a               
              combined analysis.  A reliable phylogeny of the spiders will                   
              facilitate future studies of their geographical distributions,                 
              modes of speciation, and ecological specializations.
