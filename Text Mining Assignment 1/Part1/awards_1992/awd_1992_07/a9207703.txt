Abstract    :
                   Loss and Carlen will continue their investigations into                   
              problems in nonlinear analysis which have their origins in                     
              physics.  One of the main efforts will be to obtain an extension               
              of a new approach for minimizing nonlinear functionals, called                 
              competing symmetries.   These methods will be applied to harmonic              
              analysis, physics and geometry.  Along similar lines, they will                
              study the approach to equilibrium in the Boltzmann equations by                
              means of entropy production inequalities.                                      
                   Modern physics, quantum mechanics and relativity, is a                    
              product of the twentieth century.  It is founded firmly in the                 
              last century's attempt to address the microstructure of matter                 
              and to come to grips with the concepts of action-at-a distance,                
              electro-magnetism, and heat radiation.  The mathematical                       
              foundations for these developments, collectively called                        
              mathematical physics, ranges from detailed analysis of                         
              Schroedinger operators, which governs the dynamics of particles,               
              to unified field theory, which attempts to unite the four known                
              forces into a single theory.
