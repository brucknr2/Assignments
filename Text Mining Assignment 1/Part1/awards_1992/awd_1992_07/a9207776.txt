Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This U.S.-Czechoslovakia research project in chemistry is between              
              Dr. R. Stephen Berry of the University of Chicago and Dr. Zdenek               
              Herman of the J. Heyrovsky Institute of Physical Chemistry and                 
              Electrochemistry, Prague.  The research here is primarily                      
              experimental and interpretive, to study collisions of excited atoms            
              and molecules (energy donors) with atomic and molecular negative               
              ions, in particular the detachment of the extra electron of the                
              negative ion by transfer of the excitation energy of the donors to             
              the negative ions.  Schematically, the process of principal interest           
              is:  A* + B- -> A + B + e.  This is closely analogous to the                   
              much-studied Penning ionization phenomenon:  A* + B->A + B                     
              + e.  By analogy with the second, the researchers refer to the first           
              as "Penning detachment."  The investigation will include the study             
              of related processes such as simple collisional detachment,                    
              associative detachment, and chemi-detachment.                                  
                                                                                             
              This project in chemistry fulfills the program objective of                    
              advancing scientific knowledge by enabling leading experts in the              
              United States and Eastern Europe to combine complementary                      
              talents and pool resources in areas of strong mutual interest and              
              competence.
