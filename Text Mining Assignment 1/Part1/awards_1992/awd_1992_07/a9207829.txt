Abstract    :
              Recent work by the PI and others has provided a new synthesis                  
              of description of low-level complexity classes-sets of formal                  
              languages which can be recognized under tight resource bounds                  
              in various models of computation.  Complexity classes                          
              originally based on uniform families of boolean circuits have                  
              been shown to have equivalent definitions using finite monoids                 
              and first-order logic.  This work will apply this synthesis to                 
              the separation of low-level complexity classes (especially                     
              classes based on threshold circuits), the study of uniformity                  
              of circuit families, and the extension of the circuit model to                 
              new kinds of computation.
