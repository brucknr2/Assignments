Abstract    :
              This research focuses on the use of organophosphorus chemistry                 
              related to the Wittig olefin synthesis to develop practical                    
              reagents for the conversion of aldehydes into E-alkenes. The                   
              origin of solvent effects on ester-stabilized ylides will be                   
              studied and probes for detecting electron transfer pathways in                 
              the Wittig process will be developed. The potential for use of                 
              chiral phosphines as nucleophilic catalysts for entioselective                 
              transformations will also be tested.  In other areas, Dr.                      
              Vedejs will explore the thermodynamic advantage of 1,3-dienes                  
              relative to allenes as a driver for the Cope rearrangement and                 
              studies will focus on understanding the role of heteroatoms on                 
              the stereochemistry of alkene osmylation and epoxidation                       
              reactions.

              With this Accomplishment Based renewal award, the Synthetic                    
              Organic Program is supporting the research of Dr. Edwin Vedejs                 
              of the Department of Chemistry at the University of Wisconsin,                 
              Madison.  Professor Vedejs will focus his work on mechanistic                  
              and preparative studies of the Wittig reaction, a widely-used                  
              route to the preparation of alkenes which are straight chain                   
              compounds with double bonds, an extremely important class of                   
              organic compounds.
