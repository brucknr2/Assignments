Abstract    :
              The molecular structure of two new classes of tellurium-based                  
              optical glasses will be investigated using Mossbauer spectrosopy,              
              Raman spectroscopy, and calorimetry.  The alkaline and alkaline-               
              earth tellurates will be alloyed with germanium to modify the glass            
              transition temperatures of these amorphous materials.  The                     
              fragility of corresponding glassy melts will be established by                 
              viscosity-and enthalpy-activation energies and thermal expansion               
              measurements.  The results will be correlated with aspects of glass            
              molecular structure deducted from spectroscopy.  Of particular                 
              interest is the average coordination around the probe ions (iodine             
              and tellurium).  On a basic level, the present glasses provide                 
              convenient systems to explore further the recently suggested                   
              correlation between rigidity percolation in glassy covalent                    
              networks and fragility of corresponding melts.  On an applied                  
              level, the present thrust provides a basis to determine their                  
              viability for optical applications.
