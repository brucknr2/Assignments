Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Interfacial phenomena lie at the heart of many technical,                      
              medical and scientific applications.  Any system involving                     
              surfaces is not completely understood with out knowing the                     
              nature of adsorbing species and the extent of coverage,                        
              whether the surface active species were purposely added or                     
              found as contaminants.  For fundamental studies in adsorption                  
              to have an impact on practical applications (such as strategic                 
              metals recovery), new quantitative methods and new qualitative                 
              insights are required.  Spectroscopy can simultaneously                        
              provide quantitative and qualitative determinations, i.e.,                     
              speciation.  the adsorption processes on oxide at solid-liquid                 
              interfaces will be studied by Infrared (IR) and UV-Visible                     
              (UV-Vis) Attenerated total Reflection (ATR) spectroscopy which                 
              can provide molecular-level information.  Particular emphasis                  
              will be placed on identification of the species and conditions                 
              present at such interfaces.  It is planned to examine  a) how                  
              the reactivity of adsorbed species may be different in the                     
              interfacial region, due to excess concentration, steric                        
              constraints, and anisotropic polarity; and b) how changes in                   
              conformation, tautomerization, oligomerization, or ionization                  
              equilibria will affect kinetics.
