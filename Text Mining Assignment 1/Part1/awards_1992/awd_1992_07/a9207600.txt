Abstract    :
                   The objectives of this proposal are to test the evolutionary              
              relationships among selected species of the genus Etheostoma and to            
              test the monophyly of this genus relative to its closest relatives,            
              Percina and Crystallaria.  These genera comprise the second largest            
              group of North American freshwater fishes and the majority of                  
              species in the family Percidae.  Etheostoma is the largest genus               
              (114 species compared to 34 species of Percina and one species of              
              Crystallaria).  However, the monophyly of the genus is not well                
              established and numerous problems exist concerning the                         
              relationships among the 18 subgenera.  Polymerase chain reaction               
              and direct sequencing protocols will be used to amplify and                    
              sequence parts of the 12S ribosomal gene (800 base pairs) and a                
              segment of the cytochrome-b genes (450 base pairs) of 15 species of            
              Etheostoma, four species of Percina, and two outgroups,                        
              Crystallaria asprella, and Stizostedion canadense.  This will                  
              allow me to perform a preliminary test of the monophyly of                     
              Etheostoma, explore the possibility that some Etheostoma are                   
              actually more closely related to Percina, and arrive at some                   
              preliminary conclusions regarding the relationships among selected             
              species groups of Etheostoma.  Phylogenetic analysis employing                 
              several parsimony criteria will be used to test alternate                      
              hypotheses of relationship.  Resolution of the relationships                   
              among darters will lead to a better understanding of the origin and            
              diversification of the North American freshwater fish fauna and                
              enhance our ability to study the speciation, historical ecology,               
              and comparative behavior of this speciose group.
