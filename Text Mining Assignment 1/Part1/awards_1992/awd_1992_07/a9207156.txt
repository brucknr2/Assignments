Abstract    :
              In this RUI project in the Experimental Physical Chemistry                     
              Program of the Chemistry Division, Craig will use FTIR                         
              spectroscopy to obtain structures of several small, non-polar                  
              organic molecules.  He will analyze the rotationally resolved                  
              IR spectra of the trans isomers and their isotopic species of                  
              several molecules which have higher electronic energies than                   
              their respective cis isomers.  The structures will be compared                 
              with those of the cis isomers and will provide data for                        
              comparison with ab initio calculations.  High resolution                       
              infrared spectra will be recorded on a spectrometer at the                     
              National Institute for Standards and Technology in the                         
              laboratory of Dr. Walter J. Lafferty.                                          
              %%%                                                                            
              There is a curious phenomenon called the "cis effect" in                       
              molecules with large substituent groups (which we will call X                  
              and Y) at either end of a rigid, planar carbon-carbon                          
              double-bonded skeleton, for example, HXC=CYH.  In such                         
              molecules the isomeric structure in which the two large (X and                 
              Y) groups are on the same side (in the "cis" or near position)                 
              is energetically more stable than the structure in which the                   
              large groups are on opposite corners of the molecule (in the                   
              "trans" position).  Intuitively, one would expect that the                     
              "cis" structure would be less stable energetically because the                 
              large groups can interfere with each other more readily.  This                 
              current project will acquire data which will allow theoretical                 
              studies to be compared with experimental structures in order to                
              test the validity of the theoretical models.  It is expected                   
              that a successful theory will help explain this curious "cis                   
              effect" anomaly.
