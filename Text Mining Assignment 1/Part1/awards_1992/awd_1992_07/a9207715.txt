Abstract    :
                   This award supports postdoctoral work on mathematical                     
              questions in the theory of harmonic analysis of weighted spaces.               
              The theory of Ap and RHp weight has been developed in great                    
              detail, but the dependence of certain estimates on the norm of                 
              such weights has not been adequately studied.  This work will                  
              focus on this dependence for two specific questions, one relating              
              to operator norms, and the other relating to the Jones                         
              factorization theorem.  Work will also be done analyzing weight                
              conditions which are weaker than RHp and also less well                        
              understood.  In particular, efforts will be made to find analogs               
              for WRHp weights of results involving RHp weights.  Further                    
              studies of Muckenhoupt's class Cp weight will also be taken up as              
              time permits.                                                                  
                   The theory of weighted spaces was developed to understand                 
              complex integral transforms induced by differential operators.                 
              Understanding how weighted integrals compare gives information on              
              how the integrals preserve metrics or norms.  This data, in turn,              
              illustrates the extent to which existence of solutions of the                  
              differential equations can be guaranteed.
