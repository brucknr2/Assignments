Abstract    :
                   Celestial bodies possess a fraction of their own mass                     
              which results from their internal gravitational binding, and                   
              celestial bodies have finite size (rather than being point-                    
              bodies).  Such bodies undergo their most revealing motions                     
              when located in the strong gravitational fields close to black                 
              holes or other highly compact bodies.  The equations of motion                 
              of such bodies when located in the strong gravity environment                  
              will be calculated from first principles, both in general                      
              relativity theory and in alternative theories.  Perturbation                   
              theory will be applied to the exact, strong field                              
              Schwarzschild environment, rather than working with the                        
              perturbations to the empty space Minkowski environment of the                  
              classic studies of this problem of motion.  Direct application                 
              of the results of these calculations can be made to                            
              interpreting the results of present-day radio telescope                        
              observations of pulsars, and to near-future efforts to detect                  
              and understand gravity wave signals from the cosmos.
