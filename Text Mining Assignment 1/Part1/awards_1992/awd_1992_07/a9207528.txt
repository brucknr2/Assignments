              This award will support study of the                                           
              Japanese language by an American scientist

              tuition, or other course-related expenses.                                     
              The objectives of the program are to enable                                    
              active U.S. scientists and engineers to                                        
              acquire sufficient familiarity with the                                        
              language and customs of Japan to allow them                                    
              to function independently there and/or                                         
              to acquire sufficient expertise in reading                                     
              Japanese to be able to understand technical                                    
              abstracts in their field of interest.                                          
                                                                                             
              There is a critical need for more effective                                    
              technical communication between American                                       
              and Japanese researchers.  This award is                                       
              intended to help remove language and                                           
              cultural barriers to U.S.-Japanese                                             
              cooperative research and to facilitate
