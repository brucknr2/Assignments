Abstract    :
                   Investigation of the biology of a lineage of amphibians, the              
              Order Gymnophiona or caecilians, will provide information                      
              important to understanding 1) their structure and function, 2)                 
              their relationships to each other, to other amphibians, and to                 
              other vertebrates, and 3) patterns of evolution and adaptation in              
              animals that have modified bodies, and patterns of evolution in                
              general.  The study will integrate developmental, functional, and              
              structural biology in a multi-disciplinary approach using a                    
              diversity of research techniques.  These tropical amphibians live              
              in habitats that are fast disappearing, so their study will                    
              provide information on their ecological relationships and                      
              especially their contribution to the biodiversity of the world.
