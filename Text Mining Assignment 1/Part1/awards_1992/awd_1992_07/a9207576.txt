Abstract    :
                   Systematics is the scientific study of biodiversity and its               
              historical patterns and processes.  A broad coalition of systematic            
              biologists has organized to undertake an initiative to document                
              research trends and priorities within their discipline.  This                  
              initiative  called Systematics Agenda 2000: Integrating Biological             
              Diversity and Societal Needs, takes as its unifying themes: (1) the            
              role of systematics in the study and preservation of biodiversity,             
              (2) the integrative role of systematics in comparative biology, and            
              (3) the role and importance of systematics in human affairs.                   
              Systematics Agenda 2000 is directed by a Steering Committee and                
              Advisory Board and consists of 27 Standing Committees encompassing             
              the breadth of systematic biology, including both basic and applied            
              research.  This grant is to support the work of the Standing                   
              Committees, to have a general meeting of Standing Committee co-                
              chairs to synthesize their findings, to support the work of the                
              Steering Committee/Advisory Board, and to support editorial and                
              publication expenses.  Systematics Agenda 2000 will publish two                
              documents that will synthesize important research trends and                   
              priorities, identify infrastructural needs for supporting                      
              systematic research, and document the role and importance of                   
              systematics in human affairs.
