Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The primary objective of this US-Hungary research project                      
              between Dr. Laszlo Guczi of the Institute of Isotopes,                         
              Budapest, and Dr. Joe Hightower of Rice University is to                       
              examine the kinetics and mechanism of selective                                
              hydrogenation of acetylene in ethylene and butadiene in                        
              n-butenes over Pd-based catalysts.  The researchers hope                       
              to learn more about the nature of active sites of a                            
              bimetallic catalyst, what factors affect the selectivity,                      
              why the catalysts deactivate, and how to make them more                        
              active.  Funds for the project are awarded through the US-                     
              Hungary Joint Fund, Budapest, in accordance with                               
              established guidelines.
