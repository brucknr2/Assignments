Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The primary objective of this proposal is to investigate                       
              environmental influences on male reproductive functioning among the            
              Turkana of Kenya.  The investigators have conducted exemplary                  
              research on the reproductive ecology of Turkana women and the                  
              proposed research will extend their studies.                                   
                                                                                             
              The Turkana are divided into settled and nomadic groups which                  
              differ in diet and activity patterns.  Additionally, strong                    
              seasonality in food supply leads to dietary variation as well.  The            
              investigators will utilize blood and urine samples to obtain                   
              profiles of testosterone and gonadotropins  as well as other                   
              indicators of physiological functioning and body composition.  From            
              prior studies it is known that ecological factors strongly affect              
              female reproductive biology.  The current study will be one of the             
              first to explore the role of ecology in male reproductive function.
