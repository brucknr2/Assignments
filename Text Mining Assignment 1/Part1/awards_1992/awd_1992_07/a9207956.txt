Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              We propose experimental and theoretical work on (1) tunnel                     
              junctions, (2) arrays of Josephson junctions, and (3) high-                    
              temperature superconductivity.  The objectives are, respectively,              
              (1) to understand the competition between the pairing forces and               
              the Coulomb energy; (2) to better understand the behavior of arrays            
              in the presence of quantum vortices enclosing magnetic flux; and               
              (3) to gain insight into the phenomena of flux motion and dissipa-             
              tion by comparing measurements with model calculations.
