Abstract    :
                   This project involves research in the areas of applied                    
              mathematics related to petroleum engineering and geophysics.  The              
              petroleum engineering work will consider simulation of flows in                
              porous media, including, in particular, multiphase flow in                     
              naturally fractured petroleum reservoirs.  Attenuated waves are                
              best described by means of hyperbolic pseudo-differential                      
              equations.  Much of the research will be devoted to developing                 
              numerical methods for such waves, with emphasis on attenuated                  
              waves in porous media saturated by single- or multiphase fluids;               
              interpretation of scattering phenomena related to the slow                     
              compression wave in Biot media will be studied by means of                     
              homogenization theory.  Applications of the same concepts in                   
              elasticity theory and electromagnetic theory will be considered.               
              Several numerical analysis questions related to these problems                 
              will be treated.                                                               
                   This research will have applications in structural analysis               
              and electromagnetic theory.
