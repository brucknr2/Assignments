Abstract    :
              The focus of this research will be design and preparation of C3                
              symmetric metal reagents using optically active pyrazoles                      
              containing stereogenic centers adjacent to the metal binding                   
              nitrogen to a central B, P, C, or N-centered fragment.                         
              Complexes of Cu(I), Rh(III) and Fe(II and III) will then be                    
              prepared and used to promote a variety of important                            
              enantioselective conversions including cyclopropanations,                      
              1,4-additions to enones, hydrosilylations, oxidations and                      
              cycloadditions.

              With this award, the Synthetic Organic Program is supporting                   
              the research of Dr. William B. Tolman, a young investigator in                 
              the Department of Chemistry at the University of Minnesota.                    
              Professor Tolman will focus his work on projects that center on                
              understanding the effect of three-fold symmetry on                             
              metal-mediated asymmetric induction and on developing new                      
              stereospecific synthetic processes.
