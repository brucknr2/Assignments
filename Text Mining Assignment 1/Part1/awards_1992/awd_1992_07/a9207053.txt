Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This work will investigate the mechanism(s) by which polarity is               
              established and expressed in fertilized eggs of fucoid algae.  Much            
              of the work will focus on the role of the cytoskeleton.  Three                 
              major objectives concerning the cytoskeleton will be pursued.  (1)             
              An in-depth characterization of the structure of microfilament and             
              microtubule networks, and especially interactions between these                
              networks.  These experiments will rely on confocal microscopy.                 
              Preliminary investigations of actin-binding proteins and                       
              microtubule-associated proteins will be conducted using biochemical            
              approaches and specific antibody probes.  (2) Dynamic                          
              rearrangements of cortical microfilaments and endoplasmic                      
              microtubules will be investigated in real time by microinjecting               
              fluorescent probes into living cells.  Inhibitors will be use to               
              investigate the function of cytoskeletal rearrangements in                     
              embryogenesis.  (3) Mechanisms of intracellular transport will also            
              be examined using microinjection.  Two types of intracellular                  
              transport will be studied, pronuclear migration and secretory                  
              vesicle transport.  The second part of the research will develop               
              the use of protoplasts as an experimental tools in two lines of                
              research.  First, protoplasts of the rhizoid cell provide a unique             
              opportunity to investigate the loss of polarity, and will be                   
              investigated as models of 'depolarization'.  Second, molecular                 
              approaches to studying polarity will be developed beginning with               
              production and initial characterization of a cDNA library from                 
              protoplasts.
