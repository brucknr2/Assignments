Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This is a Small Grant for Exploratory Research (SGER).  A novel                
              technique involving the initiation of cationic polymerization using            
              metal ions is being explored.  In the experiment, Al+ or Cu+ ions              
              are generated in the gas phase by pulsed laser                                 
              vaporization/ionization of a metal target using the second harmonic            
              of a Nd:YAG laser (532 nm).  The ions are pulled toward a monomer              
              liquid (isobutylene which can only be polymerized by cationic                  
              mechanisms) by applying appropriate electric fields across the                 
              reaction chamber.  Under different experimental conditions                     
              (temperature, pressure of a carrier gas, laser energy, electric                
              field strength, reaction time) different polymeric products                    
              (viscous liquids or solids) were obtained with average molecular               
              weights ranging from 285 to greater than 40,000.  Full                         
              characterization of these materials is currently in progress.                  
              Experiments are in progress to extend the scope of this discovery              
              to include transition-metal ions, mixed metal ions,                            
              copolymerization, etc.  This technique could lead to a powerful                
              approach for the synthesis of a wide variety of polymeric materials            
              with unique properties such as stability, strength, and                        
              photo/electrical conductivity.
