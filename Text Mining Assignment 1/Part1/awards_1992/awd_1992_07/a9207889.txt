Abstract    :
                   This award supports basic research in theoretical nuclear                 
              physics.  The research deals with the relativistic treatment                   
              of nuclear reactions which is required by the new and forth                    
              coming national experimental facilities.  The work will                        
              investigate the nuclear optical model and its extension to                     
              coupled-channels treatments of nuclear reactions.  Particular                  
              attention will be made on determining spin-observables within                  
              the relativistic framework.
