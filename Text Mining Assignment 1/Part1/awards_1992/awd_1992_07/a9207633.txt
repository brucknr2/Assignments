Abstract    :
              Constraint-based reasoning has been used in many areas of                      
              artificial intelligence: vision, language, planning, diagnosis,                
              scheduling, configuration, design, temporal reasoning, defeasible              
              reasoning, truth maintenance, qualitative physics, logic                       
              programming, and expert systems.  This research focusses on the                
              constraint satisfaction problem paradigm, which underlies many of              
              these applications.  The research objectives are: (1)                          
              characterizing tractable problem classes, (2) developing new                   
              algorithms, (3) addressing knowledge representation issues, (4)                
              addressing knowledge acquisition issues, (5) studying extensions               
              of the basic constraints satisfaction problem paradigm.
