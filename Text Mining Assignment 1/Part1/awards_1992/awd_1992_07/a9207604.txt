Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This award will support study of the Japanese                                  
              language by an American scientist or engineer                                  
              by providing a stipend, tuition, or other                                      
              course-related expenses.  The objectives of the                                
              program are to enable active U.S. scientists                                   
              and engineers to acquire sufficient familiarity                                
              with the language and customs of Japan to allow                                
              them to function independently there and/or                                    
              to acquire sufficient expertise in reading                                     
              Japanese to be able to understand technical                                    
              abstracts in their field of interest.                                          
                                                                                             
              There is a critical need for more effective                                    
              technical communication between American and                                   
              Japanese researchers.  This award is intended                                  
              to help remove language and cultural barriers                                  
              to U.S.-Japanese cooperative research and to                                   
              facilitate science and technology exchange.
