Abstract    :
                   Research in theoretical elementary particle physics will                  
              attempt to shed light on the origin of the masses of the                       
              quarks and the leptons (the electron, its neutrino, and                        
              related particles).  Models of the masses of these particles                   
              which are consistent with observed particle - mass related                     
              phenomena such as the solar neutrino deficit will be studied.                  
              Models of neutrino masses are important as guidance for future                 
              experiments aimed at searching for evidence of these masses.                   
              In addition, the origin of the masses of the elementary                        
              particles is one of the outstanding puzzles of elementary                      
              particle physics, so that studies of masses are very                           
              important.
