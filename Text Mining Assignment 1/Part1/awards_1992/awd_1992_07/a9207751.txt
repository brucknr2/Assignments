Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              In this study nucleotide sequences from nuclear ribosomal RNA                  
              genes will be used to examine the higher-level relationships among             
              snakes of the Infraorder Scolecophidia.  The research will involve             
              state-of-the-art molecular techniques and has the potential of                 
              providing valuable information relating to the organization of                 
              ribosomal gene repeats in vertebrates.  In addition, the new data              
              produced from this research will provide information that can be               
              used to both examine patterns of morphological variation in snakes             
              and other groups of vertebrates and evaluated analytical                       
              procedures designed for the statistical analysis of nucleotide                 
              sequence variation.
