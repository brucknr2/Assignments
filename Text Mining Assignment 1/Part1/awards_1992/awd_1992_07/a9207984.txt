Abstract    :
                   This study will use nuclear and mitochondrial rDNA sequence               
              information to assess phylogenetic relatedness of organisms                    
              derived from the various ancestral groups of present day                       
              Oomycota.  The utility of these molecules for studying                         
              relationships will be evaluated at different taxonomic levels.                 
              Inferences will be derived concerning which groups are                         
              monophyletic relative to ancestors of the Chromista (Cavalier-                 
              Smith 1986-includes Chrysophyceae, Xanthophyceae,                              
              Bacilliarophyceae etc.) and should, therefore, be included in a                
              revised Oomycota.  Phylogenetic schemes based on molecular data                
              will be used to test those based on other existing non-molecular               
              characters.  Preliminary molecular analyses and those based on                 
              zoospore ultrastructural characters have resulted in the same                  
              phylogenetic relationships among the groups in common and this                 
              approach can provide the truest understanding of their                         
              phylogenetic relationships.  The relationships of these groups to              
              other protist lineages will provide a pivotal framework for                    
              examining and predicting every aspect of their biology and will                
              be highly useful in selecting a suite of appropriate characters                
              for further phylogenetic investigations in this and related                    
              groups.
