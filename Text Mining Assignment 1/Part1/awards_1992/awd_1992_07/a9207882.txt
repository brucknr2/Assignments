Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Theoretical modeling and numerical simulation is to be applied                 
              to three areas in river morphology: incisional channel                         
              networks in cohesive soils, formation and finite-amplitude                     
              stability of sediment bedforms formed by flows over them, and                  
              sediment grain size sorting from flow shear and pressure                       
              forces.                                                                        
                                                                                             
              Sediment transport and river configurations are an important                   
              element in a variety of Civil Engineering and environmental                    
              problems.
