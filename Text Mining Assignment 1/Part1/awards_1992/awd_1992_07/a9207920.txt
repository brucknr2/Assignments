Abstract    :
              This proposal examines why some common fruits, such as deadly                  
              nightshade, are poisonous to consumers.  These fruits may be                   
              selectively toxic to those consumers that would normally damage                
              the                                                                            
              fruits or seeds.  By isolating toxins (glycoalkaloids) form                    
              fruits                                                                         
              in the Solanaceae and offering them in small quantities to                     
              different animals, this research will test this hypothesis and                 
              several alternatives.  The work will help explain patterns and                 
              maintenance of biodiversity through an integrative approach to                 
              plant-animal interactions.  The applied significance of the                    
              research is two-fold:  (1) Since many species of Solanaceae are                
              important food crops (e.g., potatoes, tomatoes), an understanding              
                                                                                             
              of what makes other Solanaceae poisonous will aid in reducing                  
              their                                                                          
              toxicity and may lead to the development of new food crops;  (2)               
                                                                                             
              several Solanaceae are troublesome agricultural weeds whose toxic              
                                                                                             
              fruits often contaminate crops, and this research is a first step              
                                                                                             
              in finding ways of countering this toxicity.  By discovering more              
                                                                                             
              about the ecology of these weeds, we can better control their                  
              spread.
