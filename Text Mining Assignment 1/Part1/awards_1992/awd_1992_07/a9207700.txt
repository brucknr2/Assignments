Abstract    :
                   This award supports the research of Professor L. Billera to               
              work in combinatorics.  He intends to investigate polyhedral                   
              subdivisions and their relationship to convex polytopes and                    
              multivariate splines.  He also intends to continue the study of                
              fibre polytopes with a view to further developing their                        
              applications to computational algebraic geometry and algebraic                 
              topology.                                                                      
                   The research is in the general area of combinatorics.                     
              Combinatorics attempts to find efficient methods to study how                  
              discrete collections of objects can be organized.  And, so it is               
              extremely important to modern communications, for example the                  
              design of large networks as in telephone systems and the design of             
              algorithms in computer science.
