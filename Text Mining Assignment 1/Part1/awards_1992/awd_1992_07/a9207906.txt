Abstract    :
              This upgrade of computing facilities will allow the W.K.                       
              Kellogg Biological         Station of Michigan State                           
              University to realize more effectively its mission of                          
              reserch on living systems and resources.  The upgrade will                     
              allow the station to         continue to function as a                         
              regional and national center of excellence in ecological                       
              research, stimulate collaborative research, and permit more                    
              extensive use of the         considerable investment and                       
              resources which the Station represents.  The present                           
              computing system is inadequate to meet these functions; it                     
              is aging, overloaded,         prone to failure and is a                        
              bottleneck to research productivity.  The principal                            
              achievements of the upgrade will be to increase system                         
              reliability, capacity, and         support, and to allow                       
              further development of the maintenance of local and wide                       
              area networking.  The award will provide new shared                            
              facilities which cannot be         managed by individual                       
              laboratories or investigators and - an improved network                        
              infrastructure which is required to support this upgraded                      
              system.  It will also permit         the Station to continue                   
              to assist other field stations in developing data management                   
              capability.
