Abstract    :
                   This research involves three components: 1) macroscopic                   
              transport properties in heterogeneous media and in complex fluid               
              patterns; specifically, modelling anomalous diffusion in random                
              velocity fields with long-range correlations, such as the Darcy                
              velocities as observed in large-scale groundwater reservoirs or                
              in space/time- dependent velocities which arise in turbulent                   
              diffusion, ii) determination of fluid permeability of porous                   
              media from indirect measurements and the cross-correlation of                  
              various fields (electrical, magnetic, acoustic) in a porous                    
              solid, iii) microscopic modelling of composite materials                       
              exhibiting strong coupling among physical properties, such as                  
              piezoelectric materials.                                                       
                   Mathematical analysis and computer modelling/simulation will              
              be used to study models of physical or engineering interest                    
              involving heterogeneous materials.  An important component of                  
              this activity is training and working with graduate students and               
              post-doctoral fellows as part of the general educational program               
              of the Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences at New York                  
              University.
