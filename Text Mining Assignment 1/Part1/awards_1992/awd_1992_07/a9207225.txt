Abstract    :
                   An award to the Theoretical and Astrophysical Relativity                  
              group of the University of Utah is being made to enable them                   
              to continue their fundamental studies in the quantum theory of                 
              gravity, the nature and role of time, the electrodynamical                     
              behavior of black holes in active galactic nuclei, and sources                 
              of ultra-high-energy cosmic rays.
