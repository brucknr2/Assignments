              Technical Narrative:                                                           
                                                                                             
              This U.S.-Turkey collaborative research project                                
              involving physicists from Catholic University                                  
              and Erciyes University in Kayseri, Turkey will                                 
              investigate the global properties of a number                                  
              of equations of state for binary mixtures.                                     
              Project funding will enable Dr. Mustafa Keskin                                 
              of Erciyes University to spend two months                                      
              in the laboratory of Dr. Paul Meijer at                                        
              Catholic University.  Additionally, Dr. Meijer                                 
              will travel to Kayseri and spend three                                         
              weeks in Dr. Keskin's laboratory.  This                                        
              cooperative research project will elucidate                                    
              global features of binary fluid critical                                       
              phase line behavior in relation to classes of                                  
              equations of state and parameter ranges.  This                                 
              project is useful from the standpoint of                                       
              providing an overall perspective on phase                                      
              behavior and strategies for representing or                                    
              interpreting it in terms of categories of                                      
              equations of state.                                                            
                                                                                             
              This project in thermophysical properties                                      
              fulfills the program objective of advancing                                    
              scientific knowledge by enabling leading                                       
              experts in the United States and Turkey to                                     
              combine complementary talents and pool research                                
              resources in areas of strong mutual interest
