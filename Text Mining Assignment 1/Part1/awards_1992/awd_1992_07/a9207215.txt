Abstract    :
              One of the basic goals of evolutionary biology is to assess the                
              extent and the nature of the genetic variability that occurs in                
              natural populations and to determine the roles that different types            
              if variants play in adaptive evolutionary change.  In recent years,            
              a great deal of information has been obtained about the variability            
              of DNA sequences in natural populations.  However, there is still              
              very little information about the possible effects of the sequence             
              variants on the phenotype of the organism.  The general goal of                
              this project is to begin to fill this gap by determining the                   
              molecular basis (in terms of DNA sequence variations) of naturally             
              occurring variation in the expression of the enzyme alcohol                    
              dehydrogenase (Adh) in model organism, the fruit fly Drosophila.The            
              specific goals of the project are briefly summarized below.Previous            
              studies have shown that a large part of the genetic variation of               
              ADH activity levels within D. melanogaster populations is                      
              associated with the segregation of two common allozymes, which                 
              differ by a single amino acid,  Fast homozygotes generally have a              
              two to three fold higher activity level than Slow homozygotes for              
              two reasons:  they have a higher concentration of ADH protein and              
              the Fast protein has a higher catalytic efficiency.  One specific              
              goal of the proposed work is to determine what DNA sequence                    
              alteration(s) cause this ADH concentration difference between the              
              allozymic classes.  A second specific goal is to investigate the               
              genetic and molecular of a threefold difference in ADH expression              
              between two species, D. simulans and sechellia.
