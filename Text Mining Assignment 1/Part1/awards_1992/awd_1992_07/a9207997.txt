Abstract    :
              The aim of the proposed project is to further our understanding of             
              manganese peroxidase (MnP) and lignin peroxidase (LiP) from the                
              lignin-degrading basidiomycete Phanerochaete chrysosporium. The                
              underlying objectives of the proposed project are to further                   
              characterize the structure, mechanism and function of these enzymes            
              and to clarify their role in lignin degradation.                               
              The binding, stoichiometry and mechanism of manganese oxidation by             
              MnP will be studied by kinetic methods and by optical and NMR                  
              spectroscopy.  Kinetic, spectroscopic and reactivity experiments               
              also will be used to examine the mechanism of oxidation of syringyl            
              and guaiacyl free phenolic dimeric model compounds by MnP and LiP              
              from P. chrysosporium, and MnP and laccase form Dichomitus                     
              squalens. The mechanism of nonphenolic model compound degradation              
              by D. squalens will also be examined.  In addition, the mechanism              
              of phenol oxidation by LiP and the mechanism of phenol inhibition              
              of nonphenolic aromatic compound oxidation by LiP will be examined.            
              Finally, using our P.  chrysosporium DNA transformation system, a              
              homologous expression system will be developed for these                       
              peroxidases.                                                                   
              %%%                                                                            
              Lignin is the second most abundant natural polymer in the biosphere            
              and the most abundant renewable aromatic material.  This research              
              focusses on lignin degrading fungi and the structure and mechanisms            
              of the enzymes responsible for catalyzing the degradation. The                 
              potential utilization of these micro organisms for transforming                
              lignin into useful materials, chemicals and fuels is a very                    
              significant area of research.
