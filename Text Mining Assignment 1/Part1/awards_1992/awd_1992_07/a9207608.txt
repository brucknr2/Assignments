Abstract    :
                   This proposal requests funds for the implementation of                    
              minirhizotron imaging to study the dynamics of fine root growth                
              and turnover in relation to resource availability and herbivory                
              along a successional forest gradient in Alaska. Virtually nothing              
              is known concerning the rates of, or control over allocation to                
              roots in taiga ecosystems, or the contribution of root turnover to             
              soil carbon and nutrient pools. Such information is significant,               
              however, given the fact that taiga contains approximately 20% of               
              the Earth's stored carbon. Preliminary results show that fluxes                
              through roots may constitute a significant percentage of the                   
              total carbon budget of these ecosystems, thus this research project            
              has implications beyond the immediate questions of forest                      
              successional dynamics, pertinent to the broader topic of dynamic               
              ecosystem modelling and global land-atmosphere carbon exchanges.

              This belowground research instrumentation to be used at the                    
              Bonanza Creek Long-term Ecological Research site will provide new              
              insights into the structure and function of taiga ecosystems and               
              serve to couple many of the research disciplines on the LTER                   
              project. In addition, this new instrumentation will significantly              
              enhance instructional and research opportunities for undergraduate,            
              raduate and postdoctoral training.
