Abstract    :
              Insect herbivores are confronted with a formidable and diverse                 
              array of naturally occurring plant toxins.  We have shown that the             
              corn earworm, Helicoverpa zea (Boddie), a polyphagous insect, is               
              highly sensitive to the antimetabolic effects of 1-azetidene-2-                
              carboxylic acid (AZC), a naturally occurring higher plant homolog              
              of proline.  Larvae reared on a diet containing AZC suffer                     
              developmental retardation and exhibit various developmental                    
              lesions.  AZC toxicity is typically expressed during larval molts              
              and it is particularly evident at the larval-pupal molt.  If                   
              larval-pupal ecdysis occurs, the pupae are frequently deformed;                
              often exhibiting large, nonsclerotized areas.  The cellular and                
              biochemical mechanisms for the toxicity of AZC and many                        
              allelochemicals are largely unknown.  This study of the cell /                 
              tissue morphological and biochemical events that precede and / or              
              accompany the symptoms of AZC toxins in H. zea will increase                   
              understanding of the protective role of allelochemicals in                     
              plant-herbivore interactions, and has the potential to further                 
              development of insect pest controls which do not require industrial            
              pesticides.
