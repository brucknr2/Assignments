Abstract    :
                This research is to study the deep structure of the Cascadia                 
              subduction zone in western central Oregon by means of converted                
              teleseismic P waves, also known as the receiver function method.               
              The experiment will collect data across a 200 km dense array of                
              PASSCAL portable broad-band seismometers.  With the array, the                 
              experiment will be able to trace the evolution of the crust as it              
              is being absorbed into the mantle at depth.  These results should              
              help to understand the tectonic nature of the subduction zone and              
              its associated seismic hazard.  This research is a component of the            
              National Earthquake Hazard Reduction Program.
