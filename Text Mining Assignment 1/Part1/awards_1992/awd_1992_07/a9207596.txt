Abstract    :
                   The lamprologine chichlids of Africa are an extraordinarily               
              species-rich and ecologically diverse group of fishes.  Within Lake            
              Tanganyika, where most of the species occur, they constitute 75% of            
              the littoral fish community and form a centrally important                     
              component of the ecology and economics of the Lake Tanganyika                  
              ecosystem.  For the study of processes of speciation and                       
              diversification, patterns of morphological and molecular                       
              tranformation, and ecological, trophic and reproductive divergence,            
              it is hard to imagine a better suited cichlid model than the                   
              lamprologines.                                                                 
                   The study will document the anatomical variation exhibited by             
              the group, determine the phylogenetic position of the lamprologines            
              within the African Cichlidae, and resolve their species-level                  
              intrarelationships.  The project represents a major contribution to            
              our understanding of cichlid morphological systematics, and will               
              also lay the foundation for the truly integrative study of                     
              morphological, molecular and ecological evolution in a major group             
              of fishes.  The PI and her institution are well equipped to conduct            
              this research.
