Abstract    :
                   Diffusion and mutual transmutation of particles of different              
              kinds, and multiplication of particles serve as models in many                 
              applied problems.  From an analytical point of view these models               
              are described by nonlinear PDE's.  This research will investigate              
              the asymptotic behavior of the solutions for some classes of                   
              nonlinear PDE's.  The nonlinearities include Kolmogorov-                       
              Petrovskii-Piskunov type, bistable type, nonlinear boundary and                
              gluing conditions.  Systems of PDE's are considered, especially                
              when new effects emerge from the coupling of separated equations.              
              From the probabilistic point of view, this project concerns                    
              averaging, large deviations and other limit theorems for some                  
              families of random processes corresponding to the differential                 
              equations.  These random processes are typically diffusion                     
              processes with or without branching and immigration, and measure-              
              valued processes.  The motion and shape of running waves, running              
              impulses, and other structures in homogeneous or periodic or                   
              random media will be studied among other topics.                               
                   Nonlinear partial differential equations arise in describing              
              some physical, chemical and biological processes which can also                
              be described in terms of random processes.  This research will                 
              study these types of equations using analytic and probabilistic                
              methods.
