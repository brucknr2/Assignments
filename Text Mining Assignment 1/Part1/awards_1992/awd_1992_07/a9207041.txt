Abstract    :
                   Previous experimental studies and observations from natural               
              crystals indicate that there is a miscibility gap between                      
              ulvospinel and magnetite.  The position and shape of the                       
              miscibility gap are poorly understood.  Magnetite and magnetite-               
              ulvospinel minerals re important carriers of permanent rock                    
              magnetism.  The location of the miscibility gap for each                       
              composition with respect its Curie Temperature and the                         
              investigation o the changes in the magnetic properties associated              
              with changes in mineralogy due to unmixing, coarsening, and                    
              microstructural development will provide new insights into the                 
              links between exsolution and lock magnetism.
