Abstract    :
              In this project, the PI will collect and analyze water samples                 
              for concentration and distribution of radiocarbon (C-14) on                    
              hydrographic survey lines in the Pacific, as part of the World                 
              Ocean Circulation Experiment (WOCE).  Lines to be done in 1992                 
              and late 1993 will enhance the coverage of the US contribution to              
              sampling in the North Pacific.  C-14 data will be incorporated                 
              with data on other transient tracers and hydrographic variables,               
              and with ocean general circulation models, to determine the                    
              large-scale and long-term flow characteristics in the Pacific,                 
              with application to the role of the ocean in heat storage, heat                
              transport, and the effects on climate variability.
