Abstract    :
                   This award provides funds to be used to defray a                          
              portion of the costs of construction of two new buildings at                   
              the Mountain Lake Biological Station of the University of                      
              Virginia and to aid in purchase of a variety of shared                         
              instrumentation items for the station.  The new buildings                      
              will permit use of the station during the winter, which is                     
              not now possible, and alleviate crowding during the summer.                    
                   The Mountain Lake Station has been an active field site                   
              for study of biota of the southern Appalachians for over 60                    
              years. In recent years, research at the station has                            
              emphasized aspects of population biology and, in particular,                   
              ecological genetics.
