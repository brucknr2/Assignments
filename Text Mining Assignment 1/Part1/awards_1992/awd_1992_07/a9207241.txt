Abstract    :
              Symbolic representation is one method mathematicians use to deal with          
              infinitely many objects and infinite amounts of data.  This SGER               
              project aims to investigate symbolic expressions in a generality not           
              addressed by existing computer algebra systems.  For example,                  
              polynomial representations in most algebra systems permit each term to         
              have symbolic coefficients but not symbolic exponents.  Similarly              
              limits in a summation or product formula are generally constrained to          
              be constants rather than symbolic.  An objective of this proposal is           
              the identification, examination, and development of mathematical               
              properties of such abstract symbolic objects naturally occurring in            
              research in algebra and mathematical physics.
