                                         ABSTRACT                                            
                                                                                             
                                                                                            
              This project addresses the question of language deficits due to                
              left-hemisphere brain insult and the neuroanatomical structures                
              associated with them.  We plan to analyze language performance                 
              data form a large number of right-handed patients with left-                   
              hemisphere lesions in order to arrive at a more detailed                       
              understanding of their linguistic deficits.  We will then                      
              correlate these specific linguistic impairments with neuroimaging              
              data in order to discover whether these specific deficits are                  
              associated with damage to particular areas of the brain.  This                 
              methodology has already been successful in uncovering the                      
              neurophysiological basis for apraxia of speech and in showing                  
              that damage to Broca's area alone does not lead to Broca's                     
              aphasia.  The results fo this project will lead to a more                      
              accurate characterization of linguistic deficits, specific                     
              correlations of these deficits with site of lesion, and,                       
              ultimately, a better understanding of the flow of linguistic                   
              information in the brain.
