Abstract    :
                   The principal investigator will study a stochastic                        
              description of mass transport on fluid flows.  The model is none               
              of birth and death on a stochastic flow, originating in the work               
              of Cinlar and Kao.  The aim is to develop a Girsanov                           
              transformation for this model as needed in likelihood estimation.              
              He will then implement this idea in the context of transient                   
              tracers on fluid flows.  In addition, he will explore the                      
              implications of these results for the adaptive sampling of fluid               
              flows where the goal is to estimate drift rates and other                      
              parameters.                                                                    
                   The transport of materials by fluid flows is of interest in               
              many scientific fields.  For example, oceanographers study the                 
              movements of drifters and chemical tracers in learning about                   
              ocean currents.  In this project, the principal investigator will              
              study probability models for such transport.  In this context he               
              will address problems of statistical inference such as                         
              forecasting the spread of materials on ocean flows.  The results               
              should be of interest to scientists working with transport                     
              problems.
