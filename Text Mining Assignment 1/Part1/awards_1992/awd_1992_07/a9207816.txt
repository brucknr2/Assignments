Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This project will provide a vacuum induction melting (VIM) system that         
              is important to ongoing research in the Materials Science and                  
              Engineering Department at UAB.  The VIM system will allow the                  
              participating Department faculty to produce liter-sized heats of               
              research alloys.  This is particularly important to projects which             
              require the experimetnal verification of computational models                  
              describing melting, solidification, and microstructural evolution.             
              The melting system will be used to produce high purity, binary                 
              and ternary alloys for experimentation.  Research projects                     
              include modelling of microstructural evolution during rapid                    
              thermal processing, fiber-matrix interface stability in Boride                 
              fiber reinforced Titanium-Aluminum intermetallic-composites,                   
              Titanium Aluminide-Silicon Carbide diffusion couples.
