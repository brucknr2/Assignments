Abstract    :
              Ideas from algebraic geometry and arithmetic geometry have                     
              contributed to recent advances in symbolic algebra,                            
              computational number theory, and in the effective geometry of                  
              real semi-algebraic sets.  In motion-planning and modeling,                    
              the reintroduction of classical methods of elimination theory                  
              -- including multivariate resultants, u-resultants and Chow                    
              forms -- have contributed to the discovery of efficient, and                   
              efficiently parallelizable, algorithms.  In number theory,                     
              rational points on abelian varieties defined over finite                       
              fieldshave provided a rich new source of groups with                           
              arithmetic properties that can be exploited in the design of                   
              new algorithms.  Functions on algebraic curves provided a new                  
              source of error-correcting codes with highly desirable                         
              features.                                                                      
                                                                                             
              This research addresses certain algebraic problems for which                   
              the methods of algebraic geometry have contributed                             
              significantly in recent years.  More specifically, the object                  
              is to study certain computational problems involving algebraic                 
              curves -- with applications in number theory, cryptography and                 
              coding theory.  The project will address those methods which                   
              have been used to design efficient parallel and sequential                     
              algorithms for these problems, and will consider their broader                 
              applications in symbolic and algebraic computation.
