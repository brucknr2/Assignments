Abstract    :
              In collaboration with the Waksman Institute for Molecular                      
              Genetics at Rutgers University, the DIMACs Center will run a                   
              research seminar in computational biology in July and August                   
              1992.  Topics will centeraround molecular genetics, and will                   
              include fragment assembly, artificial intelligence in                          
              molecular biology, informatics, pattern identification for                     
              genetic regulatory regions, DNA and protein structure                          
              predictions, the detection of distantly                                        
              related proteins by sequence comparison, protein folding, and                  
              self-organization and adaptation of complex systems.
