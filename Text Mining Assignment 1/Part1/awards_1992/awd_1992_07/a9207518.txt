Abstract    :
              Plant defenses against herbivory can be divided into two types of              
              traits.  Some traits influence the likelihood that herbivores will             
              settle on and consume the plant, and are called resistance.  Other             
              traits affect physiological adjustments to mitigate the adverse                
              effects of damage, and are called tolerance.  The effects of                   
              defense traits on plant fitness will not be static, but vary as                
              herbivore population densities wax and wane.  Theoretically,                   
              selection on plant defense can be analyzed as selection on reaction            
              norms for the defensive components.  To test this theory                       
              experiments to determine, (1) How the contributions of resistance              
              and tolerance to plant fitness vary with herbivore density, and,               
              (2) whether there are trade-offs between resistance and tolerance              
              that vary with herbivore density are proposed.  This investigation             
              will use the native weed, goldenrod (Solidago altissima).                      
              Genotypic replicates will be planted in plots where herbivore                  
              population density or infestation levels are manipulated.  The                 
              results will reveal the sensitivity of selection on defense                    
              components to herbivore population density.  Insights gained in                
              this study can help in designing biological control programs for               
              weeds, and breeding programs for crop resistance to insects.
