Abstract    :
                   The principal investigators will study geometric variational              
              problems and singularities of solutions. Professor Simon will                  
              concentrate his research on the structure of the singular set of               
              minimal surfaces and harmonic maps. He will also consider                      
              asympotics on approach to singular points including the unique                 
              tangent cone problem. Professor White will investigate the bridge              
              theorem for minimal surfaces, branch points in minimal surfaces,               
              uniqueness of tangent cones and tangent maps in minimal varieties              
              and harmonic maps.                                                             
                   This award will support research in the general area of                   
              differential geometry and global analysis. Differential geometry               
              is the study of the relationship between the geometry of a space               
              and analytic concepts defined on the space. Global analysis is                 
              the study of the overall geometric and topological properties of               
              a space by piecing together local information. Applications of                 
              these areas of mathematics in other sciences include the                       
              structure of complicated molecules, liquid-gas boundaries, and                 
              the large scale structure of the universe.
