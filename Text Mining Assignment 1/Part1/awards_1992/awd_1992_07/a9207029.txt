Abstract    :
              Partial support is requested for a meeting entitled "Structures and            
              functions of nucleic acids, proteins and nucleoproteins" to be held            
              in Austin, Texas on April 3-5, 1992.  The meeting will encompass               
              four main sessions: 1) DNA and RNA recombination - topology,                   
              intermediates and mechanisms 2) Topological problems in DNA                    
              replication 3) DNA bending -active and passive roles, and 4)                   
              Transcription factors- proteins-DNA and protein-protein                        
              interactions.  Twenty-five outside speakers will attend, most of               
              whom will pay their own travel expenses.  NSF funds are requested              
              for travel expenses of 25 young investigators, graduate student and            
              postdoctoral fellows, from laboratories not represented by invited             
              speakers.  Approximately 75 local attendees from the University of             
              Texas, Austin will also participate.
