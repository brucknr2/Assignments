Abstract    :
                   Systems of interconnected populations (metapopulations) are               
              likely to be the rule rather than the exception in nature.                     
              Nevertheless, the study of natural systems of interconnected                   
              populations has lagged behind theoretical demonstrations of                    
              their potential importance.  Coloniation, extinction, and                      
              population interconnectedness play an important role in the                    
              dynamics of the Silence alba/Ustilago violacea plant-fungal                    
              pathosystem.  This system is experimentally tractable and shows                
              host genetic variation in resistance and susceptibility,.                      
              The proposed research will continue the long-term monitoring of                
              metapopulation processes in natural populations, assess the                    
              effect of population connectedness on local dynamics using                     
              experimental populations, and investigate empirically and                      
              theoretically the effects of genetic compostion on metapopulation              
              dynamics of host-pathogen systems.  The results will provide                   
              information on the degree to which metapopulation processes                    
              influence host-pathogen systems and how genetic variation in the               
              component species affects these processes.  This system is of                  
              general interest because the metapopulation concept provides a                 
              framework for understanding the consequences of habitat                        
              fragmentation.
