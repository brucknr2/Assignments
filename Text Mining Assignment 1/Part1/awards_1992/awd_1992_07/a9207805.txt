Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The proposed research is a field study designed to quantify                    
              previously undetermined base cation cycling and weathering rates in            
              a high-elevation coniferous forest in the Adirondack Mountains, NY.            
              A new and unexplored transfer-reaction approach to the use of                  
              strontium isotope tracers will be integrated with more traditional             
              chemical and ecosystem mass balance methods to obtain direct                   
              measurements of previously unquantified base cations fluxes, such as           
              release from mineral weathering, removal from cation exchange sites            
              and biocycling.  The field site is on Whiteface Mountain, where the            
              PI's has been studying nutrient cycling for over six years.                    
              Whiteface is a unique location for cation cycling and mineral                  
              weathering studies because the site has a pair of research                     
              watersheds underlain by granitoid bedrock of highly contrasting                
              87Sr/86Sr value.  The proposed project will allow the PI's to                  
              quantify the influence of various ecosystem processes - such as                
              atmospheric deposition, organic matter decomposition, cation                   
              exchange, and mineral weathering - on soil solution and stream                 
              chemistry and on the long-term contribution to total ecosystem                 
              inventories.  Comparison of present and long-term contributions of             
              these processes to cation cycling will provide insight into the                
              mechanisms and magnitude of ecosystem response to environmental                
              change.
