Abstract    :
              This is an 18 month cooperative research project proposed by Dr.               
              Der-Tsai Lee, Northwestern University and Professor R.C.T. Lee,                
              Taiwan Tsing Hua University, supported by the AIT (U.S.) - CCNAA               
              (Taiwan) Cooperative Science Program.  This project plans to                   
              study ways to minimize the paths between the points in one                     
              segment of a computer disk and those in another segment.  This is              
              an important problem in geometric optimization and computer                    
              computation.  Professor Lee of Tsing Hua University is an expert               
              in this area with the additional human and funding resources                   
              needed to carry out computer simulations.  This is a mutually                  
              beneficial study of a set of problems for which there are                      
              currently no solutions.  Advances in this area can benefit                     
              computing and automation industries.
