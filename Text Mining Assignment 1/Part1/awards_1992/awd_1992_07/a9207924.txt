Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  The PI plans to determine the source characteristics of                   
              aerosols originating over the savannas of southwest Africa,                    
              including aerosol size distribution and composition, distinguishing            
              between products from biomass burning and erosion of mineral soils,            
              concentrations of water extractable nutrients in surface soils and             
              in aerosols, fluxes of aerosols from identified source areas, and              
              meteorological processes associated with aerosol emissions from                
              source areas and subsequent long range transport.                              
                                                                                             
                   The PI plans to take advantage of data sets from the TRACE-               
              A/SAFARI field programs to address both source characteristics and             
              long range transports.  Isotope characteristics of continental                 
              (both dry and wet) regimes will be used to fingerprint the source              
              and trace the trajectories.  Three-dimensional isobaric trajectory             
              analysis will be carried out not only during the field experiment,             
              but also for historical dry and wet conditions.  The combined                  
              trajectory, isotope tracer and general circulation analysis will               
              provide a framework to interpret the role of the atmosphere and the            
              resultant transports of the aerosols.  The PI plans to use the                 
              results of this work to infer consequences to both continental and             
              oceanic ecosystems as a function of the airborne supply of                     
              nutrients.
