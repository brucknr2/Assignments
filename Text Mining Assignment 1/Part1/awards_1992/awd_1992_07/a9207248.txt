Abstract    :
                   One of the basic results of probability is the so-called law              
              of the iterated logarithm (LIL), which provides a precise                      
              description of the asymptotic behavior of sums of independent                  
              random variables.  For many applications one needs a more general              
              framework than in the classical case which deals with real-valued              
              random variables.  The main purpose of this research is to study               
              LIL results and some related problems such as strong                           
              approximation and certain weak convergence results in general                  
              Banach spaces.                                                                 
                   This research will extend results in the theory of                        
              probability.  In many applications a more general framework is                 
              needed, and this research will help provide it.
