                  The American Academy of Underwater Sciences is a self                     
              regulating organization of active diving scientists.  The                      
              organization provides consensual, operational and management                   
              guidelines for the implementation and conduct of scientific diving             
              operations.  The Academy's objective is to promote safe diving                 
              procedures for scientific divers using state-of-the-art technology             
              and techniques.                                                                
                                                                                             
                   The AAUS will provide the UNOLS vessel operators with the                 
              technical infra-structure and expertise to assist the scientific               
              diving community in the review of diving procedures, provide                   
              guidelines for establishing diving safety regulations, provide                 
              expertise on diving accidents, state-of-the-art technology and                 
              forums on new techniques.
