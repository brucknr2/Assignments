Abstract    :
                   The Department of Computer Science at the University of                   
              Georgia proposes to trade-in its intel iPSC/2 D4 hypercube for an              
              intel iPSC/860 Model 8 supercomputer system (see specifications                
              in part V).  This equipment will be dedicated to the support of                
              research in mathematical sciences.  The equipment will be used                 
              for several research projects, including in particular:                        
              (i)  Dr. T. Taha (Computer Science Department) for developing                  
              parallel algorithms for Inverse Scattering Transform IST                       
              numerical schemes for solving both one dimensional and                         
              multidimensional nonlinear partial differential equations.  These              
              equations arise in many areas of application including nonlinear               
              optics, signal propagation, plasma physics, etc.                               
              (ii)  Dr. S. Cater and Dr. R. Robinson (both from the Computer                 
              Science Department) for developing a prototype computing                       
              environment on an Intel iPSC/860 supercomputer based on the GNU                
              C++ compiler and libraries.  The objective is a system which is                
              productive for the user and effective in the exploitation of                   
              parallel computing resources.                                                  
              (iii)  Dr. D. Gordon (Computer Science Department) for developing              
              a parallel algorithm for solving large sparse matrices using                   
              conjugate gradient algorithm.                                                  
              (iv)  Dr. A. Granville (Mathematics Department), for better                    
              understanding of the distribution function of the number of                    
              integers, in intervals of length z, that are free of prime                     
              factors < y.  Sieving different intervals in parallel will speed               
              up the computations considerably.                                              
              (v)  Dr. J. W. Smith (Computer Science Department), for                        
              developing a general parallel method for the reduction of boolean              
              (bit) matrices.
