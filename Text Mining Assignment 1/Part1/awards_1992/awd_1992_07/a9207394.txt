Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This US-Hungary Joint Fund research project on Spin                            
              Density Waves in Low Dimensional Solids will be                                
              conducted by Dr. Gyorgy Mihaly, Central Research                               
              Institute for Solid State Physics, Budapest, and                               
              Professor Kazumi Maki, University of Southern                                  
              California, Los Angeles.  This effort will                                     
              feature the theoretical aspects of collective                                  
              electrical properties in low dimensional systems.                              
              The researchers will explore two basic features                                
              of the spin density wave excitation: a) Coulomb                                
              effects in the low temperature nonlinear                                       
              conduction and b) the unusual low-frequency                                    
              response below the gap energy, including weak                                  
              relaxation processes.  Results leading to                                      
              separation of thermal effects and the influence                                
              of thermally excited screening carriers should                                 
              contribute to our understanding of spin density                                
              wave dynamics.                                                                 
                                                                                             
              This research in solid state physics fulfills the                              
              US-Hungary Joint Fund's program objective of                                   
              advancing science by enabling leading experts in                               
              the U.S. and Hungary to combine complementary                                  
              talents and pool research resources in areas of                                
              strong mutual interest and competence.  Funds for                              
              the project are provided through the US-Hungary                                
              Joint Fund, Budapest, in accordance with                                       
              established guidelines.
