Abstract    :
                   A Workshop on the Quantum Chromodynamic Vacuum Structure                  
              will be held at the American University in Paris, June 1-5,                    
              1992.  Young American scientists will participate.                             
                   Quantum Chromodynamics is the candidate theory of the                     
              strong nuclear force.  Many basic questions about this theory                  
              are unanswered.  Some of these, including the question of why                  
              particles carrying the nuclear analogue of electric charge are                 
              never free, and the question of how to treat the theory when                   
              the nuclear force cannot be regarded as a perturbation, will                   
              be discussed at this workshop.  The participation of young                     
              scientists, from who needed new ideas may come, is important.
