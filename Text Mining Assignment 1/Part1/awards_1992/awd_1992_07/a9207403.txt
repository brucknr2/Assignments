Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The primary objective of this US-Hungary cooperative                           
              research project between Dr. Mihaly Bartok, University of                      
              Szeged and George Olah, University of Southern California                      
              is to carry out systematic studies on the transformations                      
              in superacids of diols and cyclic ethers, two important                        
              groups of oxygen-containing organic compounds.  The                            
              proposed research will include the studies of                                  
              stereoisomers and deuterium-labelled compounds with the                        
              aim of getting information on the mechanism of the                             
              transformations taking place.  Based on these observations                     
              selective synthesis of certain compounds (carbonyl                             
              compounds, unsaturated alcohols, dienes) can be expected.                      
              The results will contribute to the chemistry of                                
              carbocations.  Funds for the project are awarded through                       
              the U.S.-Hungary Joint Fund, Budapest in accordance with                       
              established guidelines.
