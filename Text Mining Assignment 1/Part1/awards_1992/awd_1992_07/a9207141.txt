Abstract    :
                     This Research Planning Grant is to investigate the                      
              relationship between uplift and exhumation in the Northwest                    
              Himalayas, Fieldwork will consist of obtaining gravity data across             
              the Nanga Parbat-Haramosh Massif of northern Pakistan.  These data             
              will be used in conjunction with mathematical models to investigate            
              dynamically consistent controls on exhumation and pressure-                    
              temperature-time paths.
