Abstract    :
              This project will continue investigations of the population                    
              properties of transposable elements of Drosphila.  The question of             
              whether or not the apparent fixation of certain elements at some               
              chromosomal sites in a D. melanogaster population is real or                   
              artefactual will be answered.  Some families of D. melanogaster                
              elements used in previous studies will be characterized by                     
              restriction mapping.  This will yield information essential for the            
              interpretation of previous work, and for other proposed                        
              experiments.  A study will be made of the rates of transposition               
              and excision of several families of D. melanogaster elements.                  
              Southern blotting and in situ hybridization of element probes will             
              be used to detect changes in element locations in isogenic stocks              
              that have been maintained heterozygous and sheltered from                      
              recombination for over 100 generations will also be studied.                   
              Families of transposable elements from D. americana will be cloned.            
              These will be used to determine whether elements have accumulated              
              an the neo-Y chromosome of this species, as expected theoretically.            
              The proposed experiments will provide information that is                      
              fundamental to an understanding of the regulation of the abundance             
              of transposable elements in natural populations.
