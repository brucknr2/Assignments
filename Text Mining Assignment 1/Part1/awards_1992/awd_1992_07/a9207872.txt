Abstract    :
              This project offers potential for                                              
              advancing the state-of-the-art in                                              
              the development of new affinity                                                
              agents for separations and therapy.                                            
              First, it would demonstrate the                                                
              applicability of phage-based                                                   
              screening systems to a new class of                                            
              compounds.  Second, it would extend                                            
              the phage screening method to meet                                             
              a new goal, the isolation of                                                   
              conditional binding mutants allowing                                           
              reversibility of high affinity                                                 
              binding without the use of                                                     
              denaturing eluants.  Third, there                                              
              are good prospects of isolating                                                
              variants of Protein A with immediate                                           
              application in separations and                                                 
              immunotherapy.
