Abstract    :
                   Singular functional estimation problems cover an extremely                
              large portion of statistical theory.  Some procedures with                     
              optimal rates have been well established; but recent work on                   
              white noise problems has led to a unified approach based on the                
              modulus of the functional.  This approach gives optimal or near                
              optimal procedures quite simply for many important statistical                 
              problems.                                                                      
                   For some statistical estimation problems, optimal methods                 
              are well known, but for many more either optimality of the                     
              methodology is uncertain or its efficiency is unknown.  This                   
              research will produce generally efficient procedures which can                 
              have many scientific applications, for example complex problems                
              like reconstruction of the "true image" from tomography or other               
              imaging techniques. This unified approach to estimation should                 
              find applications in engineering, biology, economics and other                 
              fields where practical and theoretical scientific problems are                 
              framed in terms of statistical models.
