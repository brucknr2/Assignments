Abstract    :
              This project concerns new business incubators.  A new business                 
              incubator is a mechanism or facility for inducing conditions which             
              will assist in the process of developing new businesses aspiring to            
              bring to market a new or competitive product or service, and                   
              aspiring to create some form of organization that will support its             
              business activities.  It is proposed to study incubation processes             
              in greater detail than heretofore which should aid in the                      
              development of fundamental organizational schemes for how such                 
              facilities can successfully add new projects or start-up firms to              
              its overall effort or mixture of supported projects.  This should              
              lead to better understanding of the process and articulation of                
              successful diversification strategies.
