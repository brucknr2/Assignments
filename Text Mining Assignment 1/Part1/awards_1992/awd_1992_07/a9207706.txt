Abstract    :
                   Professor Thakur will work on several problems connected with             
              the arithmetic of function fields.  In particular, he will study               
              the arithmetic properties of special values of the Carlitz zeta                
              function as well as analogues of Gauss sums and gamma functions in             
              the function field case.                                                       
                   This project falls into the general area of arithmetic                    
              geometry - a subject that blends two of the oldest areas of                    
              mathematics: number theory and geometry.  This combination has                 
              proved extraordinarily fruitful - having recently solved problems              
              that withstood generations.  Among its many consequences are new               
              error correcting codes.  Such codes are essential for both modern              
              computers (hard disks) and compact disks.
