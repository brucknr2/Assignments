Abstract    :
                   This project concerns the reliable transmission and storage of            
              digital information.  These are similar notions; digital                       
              transmission concerns the transport of information from here to                
              there while digital storage considers the task of conveying digital            
              information from now until then.  Fundamental issues in the design             
              of codes and algorithms for modulation and error-control codes are             
              addressed. The application of the theory applies to both digital               
              transmission and magnetic and optical storage systems.  The                    
              research is organized into five components: (i) variable-length                
              codes from symbolic dynamics: the mapping of data onto walks                   
              through a graph; (ii) run-length codes with coding gain: where the             
              goal is to understand the nature of codes for saturation systems;              
              (iii) cascade codes, Grobner bases, and algebraic geometry: where              
              the emphasis is on developing the algebraic theory of cascade codes            
              to provide for algebraic decoding procedures; (iv) convolutional               
              codes over finite rings: use of arithmetic over rings to study CPM             
              and rotationally invariant PSK and QAM; (v) adaptive trellis                   
              coding: algorithms for sequence estimation that do not rely on a               
              fixed a priori response but allow the labels of the trellis to                 
              adapt.
