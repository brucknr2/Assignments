Abstract    :
              After the October 1991 Oakland                                                 
              Hills Firestorm destroyed about                                                
              3,400 homes and burned about 2,000                                             
              acres, an erosion control program                                              
              has been undertaken on these steep                                             
              hills.  Key questions on the nature                                            
              of the erosion processes controlled                                            
              by the burn and on the                                                         
              effectiveness of traditional                                                   
              erosion control measures applied to                                            
              mitigate the effects of the burn                                               
              will be addressed in this project.                                             
              The results of this research will                                              
              have broad significance in                                                     
              determining the value of the                                                   
              mitigation measures used and of new                                            
              approaches to control measures.
