Abstract    :
              This project will support the purchase of a continuous flow                    
              nutrient analyzer. The contiunous flow nutrient analyzer                       
              would rapidly and automatically determine the concentrations                   
              of at least five compounds. The high-resolution data set                       
              which can be produced is essential for examining questions                     
              about the controls of marine biological production, the                        
              exchange between land and estuarine ecosystems, and the                        
              utilization of nutrients in controlled laboratory                              
              experiments. The requested instrumentation would be used by                    
              a majority of the faculty at the Lewes Campus of the College                   
              of Marine Studies (CMS).  The Lewes Campus, which houses the                   
              only marine biological laboratories in Delaware, has 22                        
              faculty and 56 graduate students, and is a NSF supported                       
              Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) site. The Lewes                   
              Campus has grown in size and prominence (onc: member was                       
              elected to the National Academy of  Science) over the last                     
              five years. In recognition of this growth, the University of                   
              Delaware is constructing a new building for Biogeochemistry                    
              that will house the requested instrumentation.
