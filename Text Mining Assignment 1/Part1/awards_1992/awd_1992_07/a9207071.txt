Abstract    :
                   In its many guises, harmonic measure lies at the heart of                 
              many deep problems arising in complex function theory, potential               
              theory and, of late, analytic dynamics.  The definition is                     
              particularly simple.  For a given domain in Euclidean space of                 
              any dimension, a function is defined to equal one on a given                   
              subset of the boundary and zero on the rest of the boundary.                   
              Harmonic measure is that harmonic function on the domain                       
              possessing these boundary values (or the value of the function at              
              any specified point). It is also the probability that a Brownian               
              path issuing from a fixed interior point first hits the boundary               
              in the given set.                                                              
                   The main theme of this research is to explore the fine                    
              structure of harmonic measure  on fractal boundaries  and to                   
              relate it, by means of fractal approximation, to certain                       
              stochastic properties of harmonic measure of general domains.                  
              This work begins a systematic study of the so-called dimension                 
              spectrum which describes properties of harmonic measure.  It is                
              relevant to the large deviation theory in stochastic processes.                
              The main topics of study are:  1. Estimates of universals bounds               
              for the dimension spectrum.  2. Fractal approximation theory. 3.               
              Properties and numerical parameters of the dimension spectrum                  
              for particular Julia sets and other important classes of                       
              fractals.
