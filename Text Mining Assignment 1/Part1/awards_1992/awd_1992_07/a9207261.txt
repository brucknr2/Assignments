Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This is a three year cooperative project proposed by Dr. Fa Wu,                
              Northeastern University, and Professors Lin Keh-Ying, National                 
              Tsing Hua University and Hu Chin-Kun, Academia Sinica.  This                   
              study plans to develop models of critical point phenomena and                  
              phase transitions in condensed matter physics.  Results of this                
              research can improve our understanding of the critical point                   
              phenomena such as freezing and magnetization occurring in                      
              materials research.  This project is jointly supported by the AIT              
              (U.S.) - CCNAA (Taiwan) Cooperative Science Program, NSF and the               
              Taiwan National Science Council.
