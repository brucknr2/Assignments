Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Many fundamental aspects of leaf development and pattern formation             
              in plants are poorly understood.  This research will use a species             
              of aquatic plants to study the development of two specific tissue              
              types - stomata and lateral veins (i.e. vascular tissue) - in                  
              leaves.  This plant possesses unique advantages for this research              
              because the two tissue types are normally absent on submerged plant            
              leaves, but they can be induced to differentiate on plants exposed             
              to the plant growth regulator abscisic acid (ABA).   Thus, this                
              system presents an opportunity to study alternative modes of                   
              development against a uniform genetic background.  The proposed                
              research will examine the relationship between microtubule                     
              orientation and ABA-induced stomatal development using a                       
              combination of immunofluorescence microscopy and microtubule-                  
              disrupting drugs.  ABA-induced vascular development will be studied            
              through a combination of experiments.  Finally, a fundamental study            
              will be a made of the relationship of ABA to cell division rates               
              in developing Hippuris leaves.  Results obtained from this research            
              will increase understanding of stomatal and vascular development               
              both in Hippuris vulgaris specifically and in plants in general.
