Abstract    :
                   Lapidus will investigate sharpened forms of the asymptotic                
              formula for the eigenvalue distribution of Laplacians with                     
              various boundary conditions.  The goal is to make yet clearer the              
              role of the Minkowski dimension of the boundary in this                        
              distribution.  There are analogous formulas for the trace of the               
              associated heat semigroup.  The case in which not only the                     
              boundary of the domain, but the domain itself, is fractal will be              
              studied.                                                                       
                   The relationship between the geometry of a manifold and the               
              invariants of the elliptic differential operators on it is one of              
              the main unifying themes of contemporary mathematics.  The case                
              of a region with fractal boundary, so irregular that its                       
              dimension is no longer an integer, has been the setting for some               
              recent breakthroughs relating spectra information to geometry.                 
              This work has applications to the study of porous media and the                
              scattering of waves from fractal surfaces.
