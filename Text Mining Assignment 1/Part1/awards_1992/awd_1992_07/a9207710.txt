Abstract    :
                   This research will continue the development of methodology                
              for obtaining approximations with error bounds for difficult to                
              compute quantities and distributions arising in applied                        
              probability models.  This includes quantifying the accuracy of                 
              exponential approximations for first passage time distributions                
              and bounding the sup norm distance to exponentiality in terms of               
              the first two moments.                                                         
                   This research studies approximations of models used in                    
              applied probability.  The purpose is to determine how close the                
              approximations are to the actual model.
