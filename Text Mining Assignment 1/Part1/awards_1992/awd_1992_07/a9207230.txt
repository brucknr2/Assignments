Abstract    :
              This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation Program                 
              will help the Department of Chemistry at Clemson University                    
              purchase an automated single-crystal diffractometer.  The                      
              instrument will enhance research programs which are pursuing                   
              the development of new inorganic materials, such as                            
              multifunctional fluorinated ionomers and their lamellar and                    
              zeolite-like metal derivatives, soluble zintl anions, mixed                    
              valence metallopolymers, and liquid clathrates and host                        
              molecules for inclusion compounds.

              Single crystal x-ray crystallography is the most powerful                      
              analytical method for structures determination of solids.  In                  
              synthetic inorganic, organic, bioinorganic and organometallic                  
              chemistry, single crystal x-ray diffraction is an invaluable                   
              tool to characterize molecular structure.  The information                     
              gained from the knowledge of the molecular composition and                     
              structure helps to develop new reactions of potentially general                
              interest in catalysis or synthesis.
