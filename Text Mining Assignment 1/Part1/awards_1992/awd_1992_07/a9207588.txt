Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Climate changes projected for ext century will impact ecosystems,              
              yet the knowledge to foresee the direction and magnitude of these              
              impacts is lacking.  This study will improve our ability to                    
              predict these impacts by field manipulations, using overhead                   
              radiators to increase the downward heat flux on large plots within             
              a subalpine meadow at the Rocky Mountain Biological Laboratory,                
              CO.  The heat flux will be set to match approximately the surface              
              warming predicted in worst-case climate scenarios for the year                 
              2050.  Effects of this warming on soil moisture and temperature,               
              soil nutrient pools and transformations, greenhouse gas fluxes,                
              and plant production, species distribution, and phenology will be              
              measured.  Microclimate and nutrient cycle models, each to be                  
              calibrated with data from the control plots and validated with                 
              data from the warmed plots, will extend our knowledge of feedback              
              mechanisms linking vegetation, greenhouse gas fluxes, soil                     
              nutrients, and soil microclimate, and will provide a basis for                 
              generalizing our findings to other sites.  The research will also              
              identify climate-sensitive ecological parameters that could be                 
              targets for geographically widespread monitoring of ecological                 
              symptoms of global warming.
