Abstract    :
                   This is a $150,000, renewal of ENG-9047818.  This renewal is

              Commission of the AAES, and the Coordination by that commission to             
              ensure continued US presence in the World Federation of Engineering            
              Organization (WFEO) and the Pan American Federation of Engineering             
              Societies (UPADI).  The principal activity under this grant is the             
              promotion and development of the concept of sustainable development            
              both worldwide and through WFEO and in the Western Hemisphere                  
              through UPADI.  This action will award $75,000 in FY '92 and                   
              unilaterally fund the remaining $75,000 in FY '93.
