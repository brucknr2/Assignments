Abstract    :
                   Long-term environmental changes alter the abundance of species            
              by directly affecting reproduction, mortality, and other                       
              demographic parameters.  However, changes in species abundances are            
              also affected by positive and negative feedbacks operating through             
              ecological interactions within and among species.  In the research             
              stochastic models will be developed for population dynamics to                 
              predict how species interactions influence the effects of                      
              environmental changes on species abundances.  In collaboration with            
              other researchers, these models will then be used to integrate this            
              theory with existing long-term data sets from different types of               
              ecological communities.
