Abstract    :
              The objectives of this research are to determine what factors limit            
              or regulate populations of migratory birds that breed in the north             
              temperate forests and winter in the Neotropics.  The basic question            
              concerns whether these factors operate more importantly in summer              
              breeding areas at temperate latitudes, in neotropical winter                   
              quarters, or during both seasons.  Through demographic and                     
              experimental studies, hypothesis will be tested to determine (1) if            
              limitations occur in both summer and winter, (2) if habitat                    
              occupancy is determined by social dominance (despotism) or other               
              preemptive behavior, (3) if individuals vary in fitness among                  
              habitats, that is, the demographic consequences of despotic habitat            
              selection, and (4) what ecological variable affect habitat quality             
              and therefore fitness.  Emphasis will be on differential fitness               
              among habitats in both summer and winter, including second-growth              
              forests, agricultural lands, and other human-modified habitats.                
              The results will advance our understanding of the population                   
              dynamics and community relations of these migrant bird species, as             
              well as the factors affecting their population abundances.  Such               
              information also will contribute to the development of sound and               
              effective conservation policies.
