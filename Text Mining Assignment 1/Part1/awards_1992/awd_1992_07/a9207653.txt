Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The purpose of the proposed investigations is to characterize the              
              response of crassulacean acid metabolism (CAM) plants to high                  
              light, with a particular emphasis on the employment of a novel                 
              photoreceptive process that involves several leaf carotenoids.                 
              This process, which is associated with the formation of zeaxanthin             
              from its precursors in the xanthophyll cycle, facilitates the safe             
              removal of an excess of absorbed light in photosynthetic organs.               
              The diurnal operation of the xanthophyll cycle will be                         
              characterized in several different types of plants that process                
              CAM, including platyopuntias, rosette-forming yuccas, and two                  
              species which possess succulent leaves, Hoya australis and the fern            
              Pyrrossia confluens.  The acclimation of the carotenoid                        
              composition, and particularly the xanthophyll cycle, to different              
              light environments will be examined through a comparison of leaves             
              which have developed in deep shade versus those which have                     
              developed in full sunlight,  In addition, this question will be                
              addressed by examining the acclimation of the carotenoid                       
              composition to the gradient in the light environment that occurs               
              within the leaves or cladodes.  The operation of the xanthophyll               
              cycle will furthermore be characterized in response to a                       
              combination of high light and chilling temperatures.  The                      
              utilization of the xanthophyll cycle in photoreceptive energy                  
              dissipation in these CAM species which are found in habitats that              
              experience high light will then be compared with that which occurs             
              in C3 species.
