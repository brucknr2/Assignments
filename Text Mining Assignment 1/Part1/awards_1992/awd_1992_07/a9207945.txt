Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The feeding habits of some planktonic predators make conventional              
              microscopic application of the gut content analysis almost                     
              impossible.  This project will explore the feasibility of using                
              electrophoresis of biochemical markers to examine prey remains.                
              Electrophorectic techniques offers a rapid and simple means of                 
              tracing food web relationships, particularly with predators that               
              comsume only soft tissues which cannot be identified by microscopic            
              study.  At present, standard staining methods have already been                
              modified to identify biochemical markers representative of prey                
              organisms which are present in the intestinal tracts of predators              
              drawn directly from nature.  The method can potentially be applied             
              to novel environments and to novel biotic assemblages with minimal             
              advance preparation.  This project will develop the methodology                
              further by using specimens that can be collected on a ancillary                
              basis with NSF sponsored research during summer 1992.
