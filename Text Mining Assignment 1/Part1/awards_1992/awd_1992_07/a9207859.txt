Abstract    :
                   Theoretical research in elementary particle physics will                  
              concern various aspects of supersymmetric quantum field                        
              theory.  This theory relates "fermions" such as quarks to                      
              "bosons" such as the particles whose exchange produces the                     
              basic forces of nature.  Major thrusts will include the                        
              interplay between supersymmetry and topological charges, which                 
              are reflections of the broad shapes of physical systems, and                   
              ways in which results for supersymmetric theories yield                        
              results for non-supersymmetric theories.  Supersymmetry is an                  
              attractive approach to the solution of long-standing riddles                   
              in elementary particle physics, and the thrusts of this                        
              research are regarded as promising avenues of work within                      
              supersymmetry.
