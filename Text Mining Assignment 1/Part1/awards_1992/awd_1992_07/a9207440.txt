Abstract    :
                   SRI International proposes to perform three experiments of                
              aeronomic interest. We will use our new ability to access the                  
              quartet manifold of NO for the purpose of studying the kinetics and            
              spectroscopy of NO (a4). We will use a beam technique to make it              
              possible to measure all the vibrational levels of NO(a4) up to the            
              dissociation limit. NO(a4) is a species that is generated in the              
              terrestrial and Venusian atmospheres by atom recombination, yet is             
              almost totally unknown in laboratory studies. We will develop a                
              stimulated emission pump/dump technique, involving high vibrational            
              levels of the NO(B) state, that will enable us to measure                      
              vibrational levels in the NO ground state up to at least v = 35,               
              well above present limits.
