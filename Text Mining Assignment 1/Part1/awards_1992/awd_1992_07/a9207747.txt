Abstract    :
              This new research project will study issues concerning dynamical               
              electronic response and many-body effects of real metals, both at              
              the surface and in the bulk.  The emphasis will be first-principles            
              treatment of the electron-density response function and the                    
              electron self-energy.  The goal is the realistic treatment and                 
              description of electronic excitation in real metals, and through               
              such understanding obtaining explanations for numerous experimental            
              results which deviate strongly from the results predicted by                   
              simpler (density-functional) theory.                                           
              %%%                                                                            
              The mechanical properties of materials are determined primarily by             
              their static electronic structure.  Calculations of the static                 
              electronic structure is more-or-less routine for a wide range of               
              materials.  However, dynamic properties, such as the response of a             
              material to light or to rapidly moving ions, are generally not                 
              within the scope of these conventional approaches.  This project               
              intends to develop new classes of techniques which are both                    
              accurate and tractible when applied to such dynamical phenomena.
