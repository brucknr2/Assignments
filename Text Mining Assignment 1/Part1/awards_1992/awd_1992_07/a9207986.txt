Abstract    :
                   The objective of the research is the theoretical                          
              treatment of the formation and destruction of negative ions                    
              due to electromagnetic fields, the collisions of Rydberg atoms                 
              with ground state alkali-metal atoms and inelastic collisions                  
              of low energy electrons with molecules.  Both stable and                       
              unstable negative ions will be investigated using integral                     
              equation techniques, semi-classical approaches and the Faddeev                 
              formulation.  For the ab-initio electron-molecule                              
              calculations, the R-matrix method developed by Schneider and                   
              Burke, is invoked.
