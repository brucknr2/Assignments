Abstract    :
              Western Washington University (WWU) has established the                        
              Shannon Point Marine Center (SPMC) as the focal point for                      
              new initiatives in research and education in marine science.                   
              SPMC is strategically located, providing direct access to a                    
              wide a variety of marine and estuarine habitats, including                     
              extensive protected wetlands, macrophytes, estuarine                           
              marshes, and rocky intertidal zones.  The facilities of SPMC                   
              provide unique opportunties for research on local estuarine                    
              processes, such as productivity of  local watersheds,                          
              nutrient cycling and regeneration, microbial ecology, and                      
              benthic metabolism; on environmental impacts of petroleum                      
              refining; and on fish and invertebrate life histories.  This                   
              project will expand the opportunities for research in these                    
              areas by acquisition of a light microscopy system, with dark                   
              field, phase contrast, differential interference contrast,                     
              epifluorescence, and photomicrography.  This will permit the                   
              resolution and episluorescence technology critical to algal,                   
              protistan, microbial, and embryological research, and will                     
              expand the capabilities of our newly-acquired image analysis                   
              system.  The project will also provide support for a gas                       
              chromatography system that will permit analysis of                             
              hydrocarbon contamination in         sediments and tissues                     
              following analytical procedures specified in the Puget Sound                   
              Protocols.  These new facilities will be used primarily to                     
              support research by WWU faculty and visiting investigators                     
              and also will be employed in academic programs that                            
              incorporate research into the curriculum.
