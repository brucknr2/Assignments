Abstract    :
                   Non perturbative theoretical and practical numerical                      
              techniques are developed and applied to studies of the quantum                 
              structure and dynamics of highly excited atoms in external                     
              fields.  Specifically considered are the dynamics of Rydberg                   
              atoms in a circularly polarized microwave field and the                        
              diamagnetic and resonance structure in static magnetic fields.                 
              The methods used include the use of a quasi-energy formalism,                  
              coupled to the Lanczos and/or artificial intelligence                          
              algorithm using discrete variable representations, fast                        
              Fourier transform methods and complex scaling.
