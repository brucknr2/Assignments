Abstract    :
                   This award represents a Minority Research Planning Grant.  The            
              principal investigator will use the grant period to prepare a                  
              competitive proposal to assess the fidelity of satellite                       
              measurements of heat, momentum, and tracer transport across the                
              tropopause (between the troposphere and stratosphere).  The support            
              will allow the principal investigator to adapt previously developed            
              modeling codes which were used for a similar assessment of the                 
              middle atmosphere (upper stratosphere and mesosphere) which was                
              done as part of her doctoral research.  The results of a research              
              project on this topic could provide valuable insights into how to              
              improve the four dimensional data assimilation for global                      
              circulation models.
