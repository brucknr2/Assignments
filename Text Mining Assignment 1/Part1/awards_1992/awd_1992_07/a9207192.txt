Abstract    :
              An Ecological community is usually defined as an assemblage of                 
              species in a given habitat, with trophic interactions among these              
              species represented by a static food web.  Most communities,                   
              however are not isolated from the effects of species in adjacent               
              habitats and individuals can change their position in the food                 
              web or move between habitats as they change body size.  This                   
              award focuses on interactions that take place across habitat                   
              boundaries, using observations of natural populations,                         
              experimental manipulation of habitat boundaries, and experiments               
              in artificial habitats to estimate the importance of interactions              
              between members of stream and wooodland communities.  The study                
              focuses on resources of salamanders and on interactions among                  
              salamander populations and it tests ecological theories on the                 
              maintenance of complex life cycles and models interactions                     
              between size-structured populations as well as the role of                     
              interactions between communities in landscape ecology.  The study              
              of interactions among species at habitat boundaries is important               
              to understanding the consequences of habitat fragmentation that                
              results from shifting land use patterns.
