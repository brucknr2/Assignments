Abstract    :
                   This research examines the effects of prey                                
              immigration/emigration rates and prey density on stream predators              
              using both theoretical and experimental approaches.                            
              Observational work will describe the sizes, differences, and                   
              overlap in patches of predators, trout, stoneflies, and prey                   
              (aquatic insects).  the research will indicate how results of                  
              small-scale experiments can be applied to larger systems, with                 
              implications for testing and analyzing the impacts of populations              
              or introduced species on natural systems.  By examing resources-               
              consumer interactions, and the effects of arena size and                       
              immigration on the persistence of natural populations, the                     
              research relates to problems in conservation biology and                       
              resources management (e.g. fishery management, conservation of                 
              species).  Knowing the effects of top predators (trout) on                     
              invertebrate prey and, in turn, on the prey's food (algae) will                
              indicate the effectiveness of manipulating top predators to                    
              control algal blooms in streams.
