Abstract    :
              The Third Topical Meeting on Laser Applications to Chemical                    
              Analysis will be held at Salt Lake City, Utah on January 27-                   
              30, 1992.  This meeting will be a three-and-one-half day                       
              program (single sessions) that will consist of a combination                   
              of invited and contributed papers (oral and poster                             
              presentations).  Technical sessions will be held each morning                  
              until lunchtime; afternoons will be unscheduled to permit                      
              informal discussions similar to a Gordon Research Conference;                  
              further technical discussions will continue in the evenings.                   
              Summaries of papers as submitted by the authors will be                        
              collected and published.  Research topics to be considered                     
              include atmospheric and remote sensing, biological                             
              applications, materials chemistry and analysis, surface                        
              chemistry, molecular identification and separation, combustion                 
              diagnostics, plasma studies, trace element analysis, single                    
              atom/molecule detection, laser sources and spectroscopic                       
              instrumentation, and sensors.
