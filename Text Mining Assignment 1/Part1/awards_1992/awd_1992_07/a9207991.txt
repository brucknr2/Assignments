Abstract    :
                   This research addresses the taxonomic relationships among                 
              birds that cache food for future recovery using extraordinary                  
              brain capacities for spatial memory.  The seed-caching abilities               
              of the titmice (Paridae), nuthatches (Sittidae), and crows/jays                
              (Corvidae) appear to be independent evolutionary acquisitions.                 
              Drs. Gill and Sheldon will test the validity of the currently                  
              controversial classification of passerine birds by a series of                 
              comparisons of the genetic material DNA.  In particular, the                   
              proposed biochemical analyses will address the historical basis                
              of profound memory capacities of the avian brain and associated                
              changes in feeding and social behavior.
