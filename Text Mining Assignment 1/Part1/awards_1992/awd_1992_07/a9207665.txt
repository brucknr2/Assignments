Abstract    :
              This research investigates the built-in defects                                
              and the dry etching damage introduced in the                                   
              Si1-xGex films synthesized by various methods,                                 
              thereby developing a damage free RIE process                                   
              for strained and unstrained Si1-xGex material.                                 
              The study will involve both physical                                           
              characterization involving SEM and TEM and                                     
              electrical characterization involving I-V, C-V                                 
              and DLTS measurements.  The etch rate of                                       
              these films will be measured.  A few ion                                       
              implanted Si1-xGex samples will be subjected to                                
              electrical characterization.  The information                                  
              from this study will provide significant insight                               
              for the process control during the integration                                 
              of the Si1-xGex films in industrial silicon VLSI                               
              fabrication processes.
