Abstract    :
                   This research explores two closely related methods for                    
              solving equations, the use of homotopies and the use of                        
              infinitesimals, in the context of ordered fields and piecewise                 
              linearity.                                                                     
                   The homotopy approach involves using a single parameter to                
              deform a system of equations into an auxiliary and more easily                 
              solved system, then tracing the solution back to the solution of               
              the original system.  Applications include problems in economics               
              and engineering.  Specifically, an economic model with incomplete              
              markets will be analyzed.  The resulting system of equations has               
              a Grassmanian manifold as the domain -- a feature which                        
              interjects new obstacles and opportunities.                                    
                   The infinitesimal approach involves solutions of a                        
              parametrized family of systems.  By replacing the parameter with               
              an infinitesimal variable and solving the system relative to a                 
              larger field containing the infinitesimal, a family of solutions               
              are obtained in an efficient way.  Applications include linear                 
              inequality systems, linear programming problems, bounded variable              
              integer programs, linear complementary problems, and quadratic                 
              programs.
