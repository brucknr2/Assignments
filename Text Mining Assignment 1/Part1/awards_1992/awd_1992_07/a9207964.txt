Abstract    :
              The purpose of this project is to develop tools and techniques                 
              for performing computer assisted analyses of parallel programs                 
              and to use these analyses to gain insight into the design of                   
              optimally efficient parallel programs.  The primary focus of                   
              the project is on the microanalysis of programs executing on                   
              families of massively parallel MIMD and SIMD computers (e.g.,                  
              multi-dimensional mesh connected computers) with special                       
              attention given to frequently-used, automatically analyzable                   
              classes of programs (e.g., divide and conquer).  The research                  
              has both theoretical and experimental components.
