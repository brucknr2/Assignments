Abstract    :
                   Research in nuclear structure will be carried out.  Most                  
              of the near term experimental effort will be done at Florida                   
              State University's Nuclear Structure Lab, with some planned                    
              work to be done at Livermore and Berkeley using the                            
              GAMMASPHERE detector array.  Permanent octupole deformation,                   
              intrinsic and rotational excitations, and superdeformation in                  
              heavy nuclei will be studied.  A search for hyperdeformation                   
              in lighter nuclei will also be carried out.  The techniques of                 
              particle and gamma counting will be used as well as particle-                  
              gamma coincidence counting.  A review of all data for odd-A                    
              and odd-odd rare earth and actinide nuclei will be conducted,                  
              with emphasis on systematics.  The adequacy of current                         
              microscopic theory as it applies to such systems will be                       
              evaluated.
