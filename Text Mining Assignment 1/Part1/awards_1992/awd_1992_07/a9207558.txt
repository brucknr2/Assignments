Abstract    :
              It is becoming more common for biologists to collect multiple                  
              choices of the same gene from a population, and to get the exact               
              DNA sequence for each.  By looking at the differences that have                
              occurred between the sequences, an idea how long ago they diverged             
              from each other can be ascertained.  When DNA sequences are                    
              collected for a single gene in a single population, they will be               
              closer relatives the smaller the population size has been small.               
              More similar DNA sequences are expected if the population size has             
              been small.  This project investigates the statistical methods for             
              using these DNA differences to estimate the size of the population.            
              The more complicated case of many populations will also be                     
              investigated and the ranges of migration of genes among populations            
              estimated.  Ultimately this will allow consideration of the times              
              back to the common ancestors of all modern humans and a formulation            
              of a picture of how small population sizes of the human species                
              were hundreds of thousands of years ago.  To calculate the                     
              quantities that are needed for these estimates, the different ways             
              that the DNA sequences in our sample could be related to each other            
              must be calculated.  Computers are used to randomly sample a large             
              number of possible genealogies.  This is a promising method of                 
              exploring the statistical meaning of population samples of DNA                 
              sequences.  In this way, population sizes, migration rates, and                
              similar genetic parameters can be estimated without making                     
              unrealistic assumptions.  The computer programs developed will be              
              freely distributed as part of the PHYLIP package of computer                   
              programs for reconstructing phylogenies.
