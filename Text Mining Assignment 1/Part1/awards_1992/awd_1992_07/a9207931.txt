Abstract    :
              String Matching algorithms play an essential role in the solution of           
              many problems of molecular biology.  This project will be concerned            
              with slgorithms for the DNA superstring problem and algorithms for             
              dictionary matching.  It will also be concerned with compression               
              metrics as a measure of entropy for detecting boundaries within a DNA          
              seguence and for measuring the relatedness of two DNA sequences, and           
              with the notion of periodicity in computer vision.
