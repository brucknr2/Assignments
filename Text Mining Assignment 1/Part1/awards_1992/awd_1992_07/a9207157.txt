Abstract    :
              In this project, the PI will collect and analyze nutrient data on              
              a hydrographic line along 165|W in the Pacific, from 57|N to about             
              21|S.  This line is a component of the World Ocean Circulation                 
              Experiment (WOCE), and is designated as WOCE line, P13.                        
              Measurements of the nutrients, silica, nitrate, nitrite, and                   
              phosphate will complement hydrographic and other tracer                        
              measurements made by PI's from other institutions.
