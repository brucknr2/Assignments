Abstract    :
                   The proposed study integrates archaeological and                          
              paleoecological research to examine the mechanisms through which               
              the pre-Hispanic Andean state of Tiwanaku generated extensive                  
              land-use changes that altered local ecosystems in such a way that              
              renewable resource production, particularly agriculture and                    
              possibly fisheries, was sustained for nearly a millennium.  Five               
              research objectives converge on the issue of changing human                    
              environment interactions in the study area adjacent to Lake                    
              Titicaca:  1. to describe lake-level variation during the past                 
              5000 years, the major period of human occupation; 2. to analyze                
              Holocene climate variation in the altiplano both by using lake-                
              level variation as input to water- and energy-budget                           
              (climatinomy) models, and by using stratigraphic variations of                 
              stable oxygen and carbon isotopes to measure the region's                      
              hydrological balance; 3. to reconstruct the spatial and temporal               
              dynamics of raised-field agriculture in the study area by                      
              topographic mapping, systematic test excavations and ground                    
              penetrating radar; 4. to model agricultural space-time                         
              systematics in the context of explicit hypotheses regarding                    
              hydrological and climatic control of raised fields with                        
              Geographic Information Systems (GIS) techniques; and 5. to                     
              determine changes of erosion and deposition processes and soil                 
              nutrient loss coincident with distinct types of farming                        
              practices.  The results of this research may hold broad                        
              implications for understanding the ecological and organizational               
              bases of resource sustainability in harsh environments.  This                  
              long-term view of different nutrient-retaining capacities of at                
              least two different kinds of agricultural practices, raised                    
              fields (which are found throughout the tropics in inundated                    
              areas) and traditional dry-farmed fields may be useful in                      
              agronomy and agroecology.   Finally, studies of global climate                 
              change may benefit form a finer-scaled picture of the past                     
              several thousand years in the Lake Titicaca basin, as well as                  
              from the attempt to separate, in the paleoecological record,                   
              effects of human activities from natural climatic variation.
