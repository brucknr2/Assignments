Abstract    :
                   This award supports a conference entitled: "Lie Groups, Lie               
              Algebras and their Representations".  The conference will be a                 
              series of five seminar weekends, over the course of the academic               
              year, held at various campuses of the University of  California.               
              The two objectives of the conference project are:                              
                   1.   Fostering interactions between institutions separated                
                   by significant physical distances;                                        
                   2.   Permitting exchange of ideas between UC faculty and                  
                   students, on the one hand, and  several distinguished                     
                   experts in Representation Theory, newly arrived from the                  
                   former Soviet Union.                                                      
                   This format permits the entire California mathematical                    
              community and its graduate students to take advantage of the                   
              presence of these experts.
