Abstract    :
              This project will support the construction of visitor and                      
              graduate student housing                                                       
              units (totaling 8 bedrooms and associated shared living and                    
              kitchen facilities) at                                                         
              Skidaway Institute of Oceanography (SkIO).  In the last 4                      
              years SkIO has invested         a great deal in research                       
              equipment and facilities including the construction of a 32                    
              m circumference racetrack flume, an organic geochemistry                       
              laboratory, the purchase of an ICP-MS, a GC-MS, an image                       
              analyzer and a Silicon Graphics graphics workstation. The                      
              availability of these facilities and access to coastal                         
              marine environments has increased the demand for visitor                       
              housing to the extent  that current facilities (9 bedrooms                     
              total) are reserved approximately 18 months in advance.                        
              Since many research grants are only 24 months in duration,                     
              this long lead time is hampering collaborative research                        
              efforts.  Additional on-site housing is necessary for                          
              students and visitors because SkIO is located on a barrier                     
              island with no access to public transportation.  Given the                     
              excellent array of research facilities available for                           
              visiting faculty research and graduate student training, the                   
              institution is limited in the number of visitors that can be                   
              accommodated and students housed.  The Institute's                             
              remoteness from Savannah prevents students and visitors from                   
              seeking housing in town, for both cost and travel time                         
              considerations.
