Abstract    :
              This applicant will study the DNA-binding regulatory AraC                      
              protein in E. coli, which works by opening a loop of DNA to                    
              permit transcription.  Specifically, she plans to use                          
              biochemical and genetic approaches to study the role of zinc                   
              in the AraC function.  This work is planned to take place in                   
              the laboratory of Dr. Robert Schleif at Johns Hopkins                          
              University.
