Abstract    :
                   This project will cover a number of mathematical problems                 
              arising in fluid dynamics.  Areas covered are attractors for                   
              dissipative nonlinear equations, turbulence, numerical analysis                
              of singularity development, the study of coherent structures in                
              turbulence, low dimensional dynamical systems modelling the                    
              origin of binary stars, and hyperbolic conservation systems.                   
                   Fluid dynamics studies the motions of liquids and gases.                  
              Computational and analytical mathematical analysis of such                     
              motions is crucial to our understanding of flow of air over an                 
              air foil and microbursts in the neighborhood of thunderstorms for              
              example.
