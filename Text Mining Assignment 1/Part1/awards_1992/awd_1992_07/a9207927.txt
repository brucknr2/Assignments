Abstract    :
              This is an ESPRIT/NSF Cooperative Activity proposal, submitted                 
              jointly to NSF by Yorick Wilks of NMSU and to CEC/DGXIII/ESPRIT                
              by Antonio Zampolli of University of Pisa, Italy.  The building                
              of reusable, multilingual lexicons for natural language                        
              processing is essential for the Grand Challenge Problem -                      
              Speech/Language Understanding.  There are extensive machine                    
              translation and other linguistic research efforts in EC,                       
              especially those under the auspices of Esprit.  This joint                     
              project is expected to provide a start and a means for U.S.                    
              researchers to form a collaborative relationship with their                    
              European counterparts.  The results of this joint work will be                 
              shared with the general research community on both sides of the                
              Atlantic.  Funding of the European colleagues is provided by the               
              EC/Esprit.
