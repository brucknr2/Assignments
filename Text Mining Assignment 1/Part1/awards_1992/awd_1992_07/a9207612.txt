Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Linfield College is establishing a connection to NSFNET via a                  
              56,000 bits per second line through the NorthWestNet mid-level                 
              network.  The connection enables the school's faculty and students             
              to communicate and collaborate with the national scientific and                
              educational community, and to access network resources.  Areas of              
              science and education addressed over the Internet by Linfield                  
              include biology, mathematics, physics, chemistry and computer                  
              science.  The library also benefits from access to other libraries             
              and data bases.  This award funds part of the costs for two                    
              years.***
