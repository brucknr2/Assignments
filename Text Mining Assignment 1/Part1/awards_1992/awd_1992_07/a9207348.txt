Abstract    :
              The goal of this research is to                                                
              develop an improved method to bond                                             
              strain gauges onto bone.  The                                                  
              specific aims are to i) assess how                                             
              hydroxyapatite coating                                                         
              configuration and chemical and                                                 
              biological surface layers on the                                               
              coatings affect the bone-bonding                                               
              rate and ii) to use the information                                            
              gained in the first specific aim to                                            
              create a coating and surface layer                                             
              combination which causes the                                                   
              fastest bone-bonding.                                                          
                                                                                             
              This research could produce a                                                  
              method to sense strain in vivo and                                             
              thus enable this factor to be used                                             
              to improve fracture healing, to                                                
              provide feedback for paraplegics,                                              
              and to monitor implant stability of                                            
              artificial joints.
