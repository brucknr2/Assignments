Abstract    :
              In this project, the PI will collaborate, in 1992, with PI's from              
              two other institutions to measure Chlorofluorocarbons (CFC's),                 
              F-11 and F-12, from water samples collected on three separate legs             
              of a hydrographic cruise along 32|S in the Pacific from Chile to               
              Australia as part of the World Ocean Circulation Experiment (WOCE)             
              Hydrographic Program (WHP) (referred to as WOCE line P-6).  This               
              particular project will focus specifically on the eastern portion              
              between Chile and Easter Island.  In 1993 and 1994, similar                    
              measurements will be made on a zonal WOCE line along 17|S (P-21),              
              and a meridional line in the eastern basin of the North Pacific                
              (WOCE line P-17N).  Data will be used to examine modification by               
              mixing and circulation of all CFC-bearing waters in the eastern                
              Pacific Ocean.
