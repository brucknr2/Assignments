Abstract    :
              1/f noise appears in most high-technology                                      
              applications as a low-frequency fluctuation limiting                           
              the achievable performance and stability.  On the                              
              other hand, physical cross sections and process                                
              rates have been shown theoretically by the author                              
              to fluctuate with a 1/f spectral density according to                          
              a universal formula which gives the power spectrum                             
              of fractional cross section fluctuations in terms of                           
              the fine structure constant a=1/137 if both the                                
              velocity change of the scattered current carriers and                          
              their number are known.  We can now calculate                                  
              quantum 1/f noise in all forms of scattering                                   
              (impurity, phonon, umklapp, inter-valley), in bulk                             
              and surface recombination and tunneling rates, as                              
              well as emission processes.  For extended currents                             
              in larger devices with over 1013 carriers per unit                             
              length the magnetic energy dominates the kinetic                               
              energy of drift motion, so the coherent quantum 1/f                            
              effect becomes dominant.  The proposed research                                
              would apply this theory to solid state devices and                             
              microstructures, and would further develop the                                 
              theory in the transition region between the                                    
              conventional and coherent domains.  We expect the                              
              proposed research to benefit high-tech applications                            
              through general and practical low 1/f noise design                             
              and optimization principles, and to improve the                                
              general understanding of the quantum 1/f effect as                             
              quantum chaos, or as a technically important                                   
              fundamental law of nature.
