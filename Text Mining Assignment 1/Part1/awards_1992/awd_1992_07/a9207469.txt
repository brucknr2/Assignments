Abstract    :
              Constitutive reltionships of particulate assemblies and                        
              fundamental mechanisms of fluidization will be investigated.                   
              The distinction between the particulate and aggregative                        
              behavior will be studied by direct numerical simulation.  The                  
              results will be used to explain the differences between the                    
              gas and liquid fluidized beds, and the effect of the yield                     
              stress.                                                                        
                                                                                             
              It is expected that the research results will be relevant to                   
              both theoreticians and practitioners.  The proposed work                       
              addressed essential bed systems.
