Abstract    :
              In this collaborative research project, supported by the                       
              Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program, Professors Scherson                  
              and Chottiner propose a systematic study of the effects of                     
              platinum particle size on the electrocatalytic properties of                   
              platinum supported on various carbon substrates.  A series of                  
              carbon substrates of varying morphology will be examined, and a                
              battery of modern surface analytical methods will be used to                   
              characterize the structure and properties of the supported                     
              metal system.  This work should provide information important                  
              to the understanding of electrocatalytic processes, and draws                  
              on the complementary expertise in electrochemistry, surface                    
              analysis, and materials research of the co-principal                           
              investigators.

              Studies of platinum particle size effects for platinum                         
              catalysts supported on various carbon substrates will be                       
              carried out using a range of surface analytical methods.  The                  
              understanding to be gained from these studies will be very                     
              useful in the design of fuel cell electrodes and other                         
              electrocatalytic devices.
