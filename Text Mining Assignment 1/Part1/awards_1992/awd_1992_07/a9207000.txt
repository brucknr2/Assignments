Abstract    :
                   Research in photonuclear reactions will be carried out.                   
              The near term experimental effort will be directed towards the                 
              Saskatchewan linac/pulse stretcher ring, where measurements of                 
              the three-body break-up of helium-3 will be performed to                       
              provide detailed structure information to confront exact                       
              three-body calculations.  Longer term CEBAF projects are under                 
              development.  Photodisintegration of the deuteron will be                      
              carried out at high energies searching for the conjectured                     
              breakdown of conventional meson-nucleon descriptions of the                    
              process.  Circularly polarized photons and a polarized                         
              hydrogen target will be used to test the Drell-Hearn-Gerasimov                 
              sum rule relating to the structure of the proton.
