Abstract    :
              Hybridization has been of major importance for plant evolution.                
              Recent research has shown that hybrid plant resistance to                      
              herbivores may differ from resistance of pure parental plants to               
              herbivores.  Hybrids could be more, less, equally, or                          
              intermediately resistant compared to parental species.  Determining            
              if one of these patterns is prevalent could contribute to                      
              understanding important ecological and evolutionary aspects of                 
              plant-herbivore interactions, as well as the role of hybrids in                
              considering issues of biological diversity.  This project focuses              
              on willow species and their hybrids that co-occur in the same                  
              habitat.  The two parent willow species have different chemical                
              systems in their leaves that can be studied in the hybrids and                 
              parents.  The PI has developed molecular genetic markers to                    
              characterize naturally occurring and crossed hybrids and parental              
              species.  The PI will analyze the relationships between                        
              hybridization, chemical variation and herbivore resistance for                 
              field plants, and cloned and seedling plants in a common garden.               
              He will test if differences in chemical expression are correlated              
              with herbivore resistance of hybrids, and will use molecular                   
              markers to determine the frequency of hybridization in several                 
              communities that have both willow species.
