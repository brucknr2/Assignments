Abstract    :
                   This work involves the development of a consensus document                 
                                                                                            
              by a multidisciplinary team of scientists on the needs for                     
              ecological freshwater research in the United States.  This report              
                                                                                             
              will be developed in light of the national need for a predictive               
                                                                                             
              understanding of freshwater ecological systems and resources in                
                                                                                             
              the context of environmental change.                                           
              Document development will take place at the University of                      
              Washington in 1992, building upon previous disciplinary efforts                
                                                                                             
              to articulate research agendas for specific types of freshwaters               
                                                                                             
              (e.g. streams, lakes, wetlands and reservoirs) and for specific                
                                                                                             
              scales of interest (e.g. organisms to landscapes).  Products of                
                                                                                             
              the multidisciplinary collaboration will be a consensus document               
                                                                                             
              of key issues, an analysis of each issue, priorities for future                
                                                                                             
              research directions, communication of significant advances that                
                                                                                             
              can be achieved if the priority recommendations are followed, and              
                                                                                             
              an analysis of how priority recommendations could be implemented.              
                                                                                             
              The report will synthesize the current status of freshwater                    
              ecological research, as well identify the most significant future              
                                                                                             
              directions for this discipline.  It will also enhance our                      
              understanding of research and management needs for the                         
              freshwaters which sustain the social, economic, and ecological                 
              systems of North America.
