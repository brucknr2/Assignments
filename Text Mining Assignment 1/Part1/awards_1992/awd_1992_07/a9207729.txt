Abstract    :
                   This award supports the research of Jeffrey Fox (joint with               
              Peter Haskell of the Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State                  
              University) on equivariant KK-theory.  Equivariant K-theory and                
              the K-theory of crossed product algebras have played an important              
              role in the solution of geometric and topological problems                     
              associated with group actions and with fundamental groups of                   
              manifolds.  Examples of such problems include many cases of the                
              Gromov-Lawson-Rosenberg conjecture on the existence of metrics                 
              with positive scalar curvature and many cases of the Novikov                   
              conjecture on the homotopy invariance of higher signatures.                    
              Kasparov's representation ring KK(G)(C,C) and its distinguished                
              idempotent have played a fundamental role in this program.  This               
              research will apply the Kasparov representation theory with the                
              intention for contributing to the geometric understanding of the               
              K-theory of crossed product C(*)-algebras.                                     
                   This work in 'modern analysis' blends sophisticated research              
              in algebra, geometry, and analysis to examine the underlying                   
              theory of manifolds or surfaces.  This analysis is by way of the               
              action of the transformation groups of a space on a surface or                 
              geometric object in that space.
