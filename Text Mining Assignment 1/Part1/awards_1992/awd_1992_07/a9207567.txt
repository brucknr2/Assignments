Abstract    :
              The effects of reduced dimensionality an quantum confinement on                
              fundamental magnetic and electronic spin dynamics are being                    
              investigated in quantum structures fabricated from II-VI diluted               
              magnetic semiconductors (DMS). Magneto-optical spectroscopy probes             
              spin-dependent phenomena such as carrier spin-flip scattering, spin            
              dependent electronic tunneling and localization, magnetic polaron              
              formation, and spin-lattice relaxation processes.  The program                 
              combines state-of-the-art techniques in femtosecond optical                    
              measurements, integrated DCSQUID technology and epitaxial materials            
              fabrication to obtain a real-timed view of dynamical behavior in               
              quantum magnetic systems.
