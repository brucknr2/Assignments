Abstract    :
                   This is a travel grant in support of a research workshop in the           
              area of queueing networks with finite capacity.  This will be the              
              second international workshop ever to be held on this important topic,         
              and it will take place at IBM Research Triangle Park (RTP), North              
              Carolina, on May 28-29, 1992.  The subject matter of this workshop             
              deals with performance modelling of finite resources as used in                
              computer systems, computer communication networks, and flexible                
              manufacturing systems.  In recent years, there have been significant           
              advances in the state-of-the-art in this area.  However, not enough            
              time is allocated to this topic at the regular meetings of the                 
              relevant professional societies.  The objectives of this workshop              
              are:                                                                           
                                                                                             
                        o  to provide the opportunity to researchers who work in             
                                                                                             
                           this area to present their latest research                        
                                                                                             
                        o  to foster cooperation between researchers, minimize               
                           unnecessary duplication, and identify new long-term               
                           research objectives                                               
                                                                                             
                        o  to educate or bring up-to-date other researchers who              
                           work in the other areas of computer and communication             
                           performance modelling                                             
                                                                                             
                        o  to provide a comprehensive set of proceedings (the second         
                           in this research area).
