Abstract    :
                   The study of relativistic theories of fluids will be                      
              analyzed in detail, including its fundamental properties                       
              regarding stability, causality, and hyperbolicity.  Studies in                 
              the area of relativistic dissipative fluids will examine the                   
              connection between hyperbolicity in a fluid theory and the                     
              existence of an upper limit for continuous shock solutions.                    
                   Gravitational effects on the vacuum decay rate, and                       
              gravitational effects caused by vacuum decay, will also be                     
              studied.                                                                       
                   The interior structure of charged black holes will be                     
              more accurately modeled by including the effects of charged                    
              particle production.  This investigation will help clarify                     
              whether black hole interiors contain all-encompassing crushing                 
              singularities, or whether matter could conceivably escape                      
              destruction and emerge into "another" universe.
