Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Dr. Hunten and his colleagues at the University of Arizona will                
              continue a program of theoretical study of planetary atmospheres               
              and that of Earth from a planetary viewpoint, largely based on                 
              spacecraft and remote observations.  With prior NSF grants, Dr.                
              Hunten has worked on the atmospheres of Titan, Moon, Mercury,                  
              Uranus, Triton, and Mars, and on micrometeoroid entry at Uranus and            
              Earth.  Many of the specific problems to be addressed with the                 
              current grant grow out of these prior studies.  Two of them are of             
              particular interest:  (1) An attempt to understand the tenuous                 
              atmospheres of Moon and Mercury by studying the interaction of                 
              atoms with the surface, and (2) Study of preservation of                       
              micrometeoroids entering the Earth's atmosphere, by aerocapture in             
              the thermosphere.
