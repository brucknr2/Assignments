Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The Louisiana State University Marine Consortium (LUMCON) proposes             
              to supply technician support for NSF-funded research projects on               
              the R/V Pelican, a 105 foot vessel that is owned by the University.            
                                                                                             
              Operation will be primarily in the Gulf of Mexico.  Marine                     
              technicians are responsible for the operation of all shipboard                 
              instrumentation and data acquisition equipment during research                 
              cruises.  They are also responsible for the maintenance of                     
              shipboard instrumentation and data systems.  Funding for each year             
              of this proposal will be negotiated separately and will depend on              
              ship schedules.
