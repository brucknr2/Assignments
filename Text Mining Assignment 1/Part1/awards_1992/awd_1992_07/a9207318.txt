Abstract    :
              The principal scope of the proposed work is to show  that weakly               
              coupled, flexible, cyclic assemblies with geometric                            
              nonlinearities due to finite-amplitude motions, possess localized              
              nonlinear modes, i.e., free oscillations during which the motion               
              is mainly confined to only one of their subsystems. This will be               
              achieved by using a multiple-scales averaging methodology and                  
              studying the corresponding amplitude and phase modulation                      
              equations. The effects of internal resonances between flexible                 
              modes on the mode localization will be analytically investigated               
              and the force responses of the system due to external harmonic                 
              loads will be considered. It will be shown that weakly coupled                 
              cyclic assemblies possess fundamental, subharmonic and                         
              superharmonic localized resonances, during which only a limited                
              number of their subsystems resonate. Motion confinement of                     
              externally generated disturbances due to nonlinear mode                        
              localization will then be investigated by numerical computations,              
              involving finite element and Gallerkin methodologies. The                      
              principal aim of this study is to show that the inherent dynamics              
              of certain weakly coupled, nonlinear cyclic systems, lead to                   
              motion confinement of externally induced disturbances. The                     
              controllability of such systems  is then greatly improved, since               
              in designing for passive or active vibration isolation, one needs              
              only consider the dynamics of a limited number of their                        
              substructure instead of considering the response of the whole                  
              cyclic assembly.*** //
