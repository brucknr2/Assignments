Abstract    :
                   Powerful techniques using total variation distance have been              
              developed to give bounds on how close a particular distribution                
              is to the Poisson distribution.  These techniques can be                       
              exploited in population genetics to give asymptotically efficient              
              estimates of population parameters for models involving                        
              selection.  This research also studies a mathematical model for                
              the evolution of recombinant DNA. A third problem is to consider               
              the statistical limitation of new technology which may someday be              
              used for DNA sequencing.                                                       
                   Interpreting the vast amount of DNA data now available                    
              requires mathematical models that take into account statistical                
              variability.  Using new probability techniques, this research                  
              will develop insight into three scientifically relevant problems               
              in genetics.
