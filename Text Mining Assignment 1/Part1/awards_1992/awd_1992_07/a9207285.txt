Abstract    :
                   This research is concerned with the representations of                    
              semisimple groups over finite fields and quantum groups.  The                  
              principal investigator will study characters of finite                         
              dimensional irreducible representations of quantum groups at                   
              roots of 1.  He will also study character sheaves and their                    
              relation with the irreducible characters of finite groups of Lie               
              type.  Finally, he will study canonical bases of enveloping                    
              algebras.  One of the postdoctoral associates will work on Lang's              
              conjecture in positive characteristic and Chow groups of some                  
              moduli spaces of curves.  Another postdoctoral associate will                  
              work on a proof of the Lefschetz Trace Formula for algebraic                   
              stacks and the conjecture of Weil on Tamagawa Numbers over                     
              function fields.  Another postdoctoral associate will study both               
              the applications of analytic tools to the understanding of                     
              quantum groups and the use of quantum groups to approach                       
              questions of analytic interest.                                                
                   Quantum groups are a new area of research for both                        
              mathematicians and physicists.  On the mathematical side, it                   
              combines three of the oldest areas of "pure" mathematics,                      
              algebra, analysis and geometry, yet it is of great interest to                 
              physicists working on conformal quantum field theory.
