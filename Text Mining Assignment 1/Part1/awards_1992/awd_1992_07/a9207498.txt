Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This study will test the concepts that community structure and                 
              ecosystem processes in streams are strongly influenced by the                  
              resource base and assess the strengths of upstream-downstream                  
              linkages in streams.  The investigators will do this by examining              
              the effects of excluding allochthonous leaf litter for three years             
              from a headwater stream draining a forested watershed at Coweeta               
              Hydrological Laboratory, North Carolina.  This manipulation will               
              allow them to examine changes in organic matter standing crop,                 
              food quality, and benthic community structure in response to the               
              decrease in resources and accompanying changes in ecosystem                    
              processes such as organic matter transport and nutrient dynamics.              
              It will also allow them to assess the relative importance of                   
              external and "new" (e.g. from annual litterfall) vs. internal and              
              "old" (e.g. from leaching of stored organic matter) sources of                 
              nutrients and dissolved organic carbon (DOC).  The investigators               
              have seven years of pretreatment data for both the manipulated and             
              reference streams for many of the parameters proposed to be                    
              measured in this study and propose an additional pretreatment                  
              year for other parameters.  This study assesses two important                  
              linkages proposed for stream ecosystems: 1) major aquatic-                     
              terrestrial linkages (litter inputs) will be severely curtailed,               
              and 2) the upstream-downstream linkage in a stream segment                     
              (recovery zone) immediately below the manipulated catchment will               
              be assessed with respect to benthic invertebrates, particulate and             
              dissolved organic matter transport.
