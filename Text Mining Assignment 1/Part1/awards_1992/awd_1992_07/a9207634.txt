Abstract    :
                   Professor Caldwell will continue her studies of atomic                    
              structure and dynamics of ionization using synchrotron radiation               
              as the optical source.  She will study two new aspects of the                  
              dynamics of energy flow inside atoms:  inner-shell ionization of               
              open-shell atoms, and electron-electron correlations by means of               
              photoionization coincidence methods.  The correlation work is                  
              important in answering one of the most important questions in                  
              atomic structure:  how does the motion of three charged particles              
              correlate as they recede from each other after absorption of                   
              ionizing radiation?
