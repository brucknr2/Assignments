Abstract    :
              Bryophytes exhibit a wide range of breeding systems which may                  
              result in divergent patterns of gene flow.  Differences in gene                
              flow may influence the species potential for microsite adaptation.             
              Thus, species of contrasting reproductive mode are included in this            
              study of local differentiation.  Patterns of gene flow dispersal of            
              spores, gametes and asexual propagules will be assessed.  These                
              studies are based on 3 years of field experiments and laboratory               
              analysis.  The proposal offers significant opportunities for                   
              research collaboration for undergraduates and provides funds for               
              faculty research at an institution primarily devoted to teaching.              
              The proposed research will enhance our understanding of the role of            
              selection and environmental heterogeneity in the maintenance of                
              genetic diversity, and add to our knowledge of the reproductive                
              ecology of a little-studied, but ubiquitous group of organisms.
