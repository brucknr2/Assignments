Abstract    :
              The Sixth Meeting of the International Society of Molecular Plant-             
              Microbe Interactions (IS-MPMI) will be held in Seattle, Washington,            
              11-17 July, 1992.  This society has member scientists from 25                  
              countries who are studying interactions between bacteria, and fungi            
              with their host plants, using molecular techniques.  These                     
              interactions include both the microorganism and the response of the            
              host.  Members of the society are also interested in the                       
              consequences and applications of these interactions to                         
              biotechnology.  This meeting represents the major forum for the                
              exchange of information and ideas between scientists whose research            
              is providing a rapidly expanding body of knowledge in an                       
              increasingly important area of research in plant science.
