Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  The object of this research is the meteorological                         
              interpretation of the observed electrical structure (electric                  
              field) of several mesoscale convective systems which occurred in               
              Oklahoma in 1991.  Cognate meteorological observations, including              
              airborne radar and cloud physics, were also made by two research               
              aircraft.  Particular emphasis will be devoted to the electrical               
              structure, and its meteorological origin, of regions of stratiform             
              clouds and "bow (radar) echoes".
