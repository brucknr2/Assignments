Abstract    :
                   Small islands in the Gulf of California support                           
              extraordinarily high densities of many species compared to larger              
                                                                                             
              islands or the mainland.  Three variables are important:                       
              productivity flowing from the marine to terrestrial ecosystems;                
              the presence of predators; and relative colonizing ability.                    
              Small island receive more nutrients from shore drift and marine                
              birds (land plants provide little energy).  The scaling effect is              
                                                                                             
              counter-intuitive to the general notion that larger islands are                
              more productive.  Scaling also influences predation: small                     
              islands lack many predators found on larger islands, allowing                  
              high marine productivity to produce large populations.  Predators              
                                                                                             
              drastically reduce population size on larger islands and the                   
              mainland.  Thus community and food web dynamics vary greatly with              
                                                                                             
              habitat size, productivity, species composition and dependence on              
                                                                                             
              habitats.  Overall, the research objectives are to connect the                 
              seemingly unrelated food webs form marine and terrestrial systems              
                                                                                             
              and to integrate elements of landscape ecology with the effects                
              of variable production and productivity to understand food web                 
              and community structure.  In general this research provides an                 
              understanding of factors affecting abundance and biodiversity.                 
              This system is a general model for fragmented habitats, each of                
              different size and each exhibiting different combinations of                   
              species and interconnections to other habitats.
