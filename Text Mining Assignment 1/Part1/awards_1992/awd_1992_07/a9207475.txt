Abstract    :
                   The earliest history of land-living vertebrates, from 370-320             
              million years before present, is represented by a very few fossils             
              from a handful of localities.  Most of these fossils are poorly                
              preserved and incomplete, which makes it difficult for                         
              paleontologists to interpret the early history of terrestrial                  
              vertebrates.  Much has been learned from study of the                          
              currently-available fossils, and more can still be learned from the            
              few available examples.  However, further progress in understanding            
              the earliest history of land-living vertebrates will come primarily            
              from the discovery of new fossils.                                             
                   In 1985, a new locality containing numerous fossils of early              
              land vertebrates was discovered in southeastern Iowa near the town             
              of Delta.  The Delta site has been dated by geologists at about 340            
              million years old, which makes it the oldest early-land-animal                 
              locality in the United States, and one of the oldest in the world.             
              Over a periods of three years, more than 600 specimens including               
              about 50 partial skeletons, some nearly complete, were collected;              
              most of this collection is stored in the Field Museum of Natural               
              History, and some at the University of Iowa.  The fossils are                  
              well-preserved and the collection represents the largest number of             
              good specimens of any early-land-vertebrate locality.  At least                
              three new species are present, each very primitive.  These three               
              species represent an increase of about 20% in the known number of              
              such early land vertebrates.  The Delta fossils thus comprise one              
              of the most significant paleontological discoveries in decades.                
                   Field Museum fossil preparators have already spent over 3,000             
              person-hours on Delta specimens.  Support for this research project            
              will fund a further 700 hours of technical help.  The majority of              
              this effort (560 hours) will be focused on preparing additional key            
              specimens of the most abundant species in the delta collection for             
              scientific study.  The remainder (140 hours) will be used to                   
              produce scientific illustrations of this species for publication.
