Abstract    :
                   If neutrinos have nonzero rest masses, then, either in                    
              matter or in vacuum, a neutrino of one type can change into                    
              one of another.  This phenomenon is known as neutrino                          
              oscillation.  In the present theoretical physics project, an                   
              attempt will be made to achieve a more correct and thorough                    
              understanding of the behavior of massive neutrinos in matter                   
              and in vacuum, and in particular a better understanding of                     
              neutrino oscillation.  Since the observation of neutrino                       
              oscillation, with its implication that neutrinos have mass,                    
              could be the first evidence for any physics beyond the well-                   
              established so-called "Standard Model" of the elementary                       
              particles and forces, a correct understanding of oscillation                   
              is very important.
