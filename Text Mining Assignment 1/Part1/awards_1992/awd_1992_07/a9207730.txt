Abstract    :
                   Stochastic models and methodologies for statistical                       
              inference will be developed in the context of modern                           
              instrumentation-intensive experimentation.  Bayesian, likelihood-              
              based, semi- and non-parametric methods will be investigated for               
              prediction, calibration, testing and constructing confidence                   
              intervals.  Efficient and numerically stable computational                     
              algorithms will be developed and statistical properties will be                
              investigated both theoretically and via computer experimentation.              
                   Much modern science relies on instrumentation-intensive                   
              experimentation.  With instrument-generated data, the problem may              
              be prediction of responses for new inputs or untried experimental              
              conditions, or calibration of the responses for the test                       
              settings, or understanding which components of the response bear               
              a scientific relationship to the input variables.  A variety of                
              processes may influence each observed response; the simplest is                
              simple random error, others include deliberate or accidental                   
              censoring, and the limitations due the precision of the measuring              
              instrument.  Proper, efficient and valuable inferences require                 
              statistical models and inferential methodologies with correct                  
              understandings of all these processes.
