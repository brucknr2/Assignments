Abstract    :
                   This grant is to study the solar wind near the sun using a                
              variety of radio propagation methods.  The results of this "radio              
              probing" will be compared with other ground-based coronal                      
              observations and with in-situ observations from space-craft.  The              
              basic objectives are to understand the mechanism(s) of coronal                 
              heating and of solar wind acceleration, and the relationship                   
              between large scale photospheric structures and large scale solar              
              wind structures.  Ultimately, such understanding is necessary to               
              understand the coupling between the sun and the earth, enabling us             
              to understand and even to predict conditions in the space                      
              environment around the earth.                                                  
                   The radio-remote-sensing observations detect the results of               
              phase modulation of radio waves passing through the solar wind in              
              various ways.  This phase modulation is linearly proportional to               
              the electron density.  Thus one observed the effects of electron               
              density fluctuations.  The simplest observation is to measure the              
              solar wind velocity.  However, the velocity is not the only                    
              information one can derive.  One can also estimate the spatial                 
              spectrum of these density fluctuations and how they are couples to             
              velocity fluctuations.  One can see the effects of plasma waves in             
              these observations and test their consistency with theoretical wave            
              spectra.  One could use these methods to provide ground-based                  
              support for the ULYSSES polar-orbiting space-craft.  The ULYSSES               
              mission will provide perhaps the only opportunity to directly                  
              observe the solar poles in this generation.
