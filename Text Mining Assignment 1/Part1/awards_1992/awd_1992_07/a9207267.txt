Abstract    :
              Sarrafzadeh         The research is in four areas of geometric algorithms for 
              design tools.  The research topics are:  1.     floor planning by graph
              dualization;  2.     placement of modules by exploiting circuit regularities; 
              3.     rectilinear Steiner tree problems; and  4.     point dominance problems.
                      In floor-planning, topological aspects of the problem are  considered
              and geometric issues such as sizing are explored.  A  clustering technique for
              module placement, that exploits  regularities in circuit structures, is being
              investigated.  In  this way natural clusters that reflect the hierarchical 
              perspective of circuit connections can be built automatically.   Problems in
              approximate designs for global and single layer  routing using Steiner trees
              are being investigated.  Point  dominance, from computational geometry, is
              being applied to  circuit layout problems.
