Abstract    :
              This project will continue the design process for an Arctic                    
              Research Vessel.  The concept design, completed in spring 1991,                
              received wide distribution and comment from the scientific                     
              community.  As a result, a larger, more capable ship including                 
              consideration for alternative hull forms is under examination.                 
              Incorporating science operational profiles, the first phase of                 
              the project will redefine the science mission requirements and                 
              decide on the appropriate hull form.  Phase two will complete the              
              preliminary design after NSF review of the phase one results.  A               
              subcontract to the Glosten Associates will provide naval                       
              architectural assistance during both phases.                                   
                                                                                             
              The project directors are fully qualified to conduct this project              
              having had considerable experience in Arctic research and Arctic               
              research ships.
