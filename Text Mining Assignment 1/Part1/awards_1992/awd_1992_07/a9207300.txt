Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This US-Hungary research project between Dr. Gerald D.                         
              Fasman of Brandeis University and Dr. Miklos Hollosi of                        
              the Institute of Organic Chemistry, Budapest, Hungary                          
              involves synthesis and study of the conformation of                            
              glycopeptides.  The researchers will synthesize model                          
              compounds in both classes; N- and O-glycosidic model B-                        
              turn tetrapeptides.  Once prepared, the researchers will                       
              investigate the conformation of these model compounds by                       
              physical-biochemical techniques, including circular                            
              dichroisim, nuclear magnetic resonance and infra-red                           
              spectroscopy.  They will use conformational energy                             
              calculations by the MMPMI (1985) to assist in                                  
              conformational assignments.  The roles of glycoproteins                        
              have been shown to play important roles in biological                          
              processes, however, little research has been carried out                       
              on the role of conformation in the various biological                          
              fluctuations.  Results should improve our understanding of                     
              the role that carbohydrates play in glycoprotein function                      
              and conformation.                                                              
                                                                                             
              This project in biochemistry fulfills the program                              
              objective of advancing scientific knowledge by enabling                        
              leading experts in the United States and Eastern Europe to                     
              combine complementary talents and pool resources in areas                      
              of strong mutual interest and competence.
