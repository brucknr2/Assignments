Abstract    :
                   Theoretical research in elementary particle physics and                   
              astrophysics will focus on studies which can help elucidate                    
              the nature of the dark matter which is known to be present in                  
              our universe, on the substructure of nucleons, and on small                    
              low-energy effects which can probe physics at energy scales                    
              beyond those accessible to present - day accelerators.  The                    
              nature of the dark matter is one of the outstanding puzzles of                 
              astrophysics.  The substructure of nucleons can teach us much                  
              about the strong nuclear force.
