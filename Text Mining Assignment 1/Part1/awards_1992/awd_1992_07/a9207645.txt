Abstract    :
              The Department of Chemistry at the University of Washington                    
              will use this award from the Chemical Research Instrumentation                 
              Program to help acquire a mini-supercomputer. The areas of                     
              chemical research that will be enhanced by the acquisition                     
              include the following:  (1) computational research on the                      
              electronic structure of organic and organometallic molecules,                  
              (2) wave packet dynamics and surface scattering, (3) surface                   
              scattering and condensed matter simulations, (4) simulations of                
              molecular fluids and biologically important molecules and                      
              quantum theory of highly excited states, and (5) quantum and                   
              semiclassical simulations of clusters and molecular dynamics                   
              simulations of sputtering from surfaces.                                       
                                                                                             
              %%%                                                                            
              The computational demands of modern chemical research require                  
              the proper computing system that would avoid wasteful                          
              bottlenecks by balancing a variety of computational                            
              capabilities with individual workstations, networks, hardware                  
              and software maintenance, support personnel and training in all                
              areas of computational chemistry.  Many new insights into                      
              kinetics of chemical reactions can be developed through                        
              theoretical studies with use of mini supercomputers when the                   
              experimental data are inaccessible.
