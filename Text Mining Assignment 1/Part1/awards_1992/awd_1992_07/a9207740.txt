Abstract    :
                   Helton will work to extend the classical theory of                        
              interpolation of matrix-valued functions, and the branch of                    
              operator theory called the commutant lifting, in several                       
              different ways: to extend the basic linear theory, to develop                  
              such a theory for nonlinear generalizations of multiplication                  
              operators and operator models, and to develop function theoretic               
              extensions and their numerics.  Another major effort will be to                
              extend this type of mathematics to nonlinear operators, control                
              systems, and circuits.                                                         
                   Operator theory is that part of mathematics that studies the              
              infinite dimensional generalizations of matrices.  In particular,              
              when restricted to finite dimensional subspaces, an operator has               
              the usual linear properties, and thus can be represented by a                  
              matrix.  The central problem in operator theory is to classify                 
              operators satisfying additional conditions given in terms of                   
              associated operators (e.g. the adjoint) or in terms of the                     
              underlying space.  Operator theory underlies much of mathematics,              
              and many of the applications of mathematics to other sciences.
