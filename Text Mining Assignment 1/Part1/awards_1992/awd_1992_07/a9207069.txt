Abstract    :
                   The principal investigator will develop and improve methods               
              for understanding bifurcation from invariant tori, semi-linear                 
              elliptic problems in unbounded domains, and singularly perturbed               
              differentiable systems.  The underlying technique is the theory                
              of invariant manifolds.                                                        
                   Dynamical systems encompass both ordinary and partial                     
              differential equations, expressing a geometric approach to the                 
              study of such equations.  An understanding of invariant manifolds              
              is extremely critical as it gives a great deal of information                  
              about behavior of solutions in a neighborhood of special                       
              solutions.
