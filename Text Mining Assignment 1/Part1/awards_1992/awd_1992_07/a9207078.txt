Abstract    :
                   The principal investigator will study applications cyclic                 
              homology and related algebraic constructions such as the                       
              deformation theory of algebras to quantum mechanics, microlocal                
              analysis, index theory, and algebraic K-theory.                                
                   This award will support research in the general area of                   
              differential geometry and global analysis. Differential geometry               
              is the study of the relationship between the geometry of a space               
              and analytic concepts defined on the space. Global analysis is                 
              the study of the overall geometric and topological properties of               
              a space by piecing together local information. Applications of                 
              these areas of mathematics in other sciences include the                       
              structure of complicated molecules, liquid-gas boundaries, and                 
              the large scale structure of the universe.
