Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  The objectives of this research are twofold:  (1) to test the             
              ability of an existing liquid-water-meter to function successfully             
              when exposed to high liquid water contents and icing conditions at             
              aircraft wind speeds, and (2) to calibrate the meter under                     
              controlled laboratory conditions.
