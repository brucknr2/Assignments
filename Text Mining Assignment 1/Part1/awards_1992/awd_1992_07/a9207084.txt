Abstract    :
              The primary objective of this research is to discover and recover              
              remains of giant extinct primates in Madagascar and to determine               
              their dates of extinction and interaction with the first human                 
              colonizers of the island. The giant "subfossil" (recently extinct)             
              lemurs represent an unusual group of primates of special interest              
              due their large body size and extreme adaptations. The effect of               
              the very late human arrival on the environment is also noteworthy              
              not only for its specific impact on the primate fauna of Madagascar            
              but also for its more general implications with respect to current             
              environmental issues (e.g., the relationship between human                     
              modifications of the environment and associated extinction events).
