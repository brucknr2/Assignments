Abstract    :
              The proposed biophysical studies comprises of two parts:                       
              electron-nuclear double resonance (endor) investigations of                    
              metalloenzymes; studies of long-range electron transfer within                 
              protein complexes.  Dr. Hoffman is engaged in a program of multi-              
              frequency cw and pulsed endor investigations of (i) the metal                  
              centers of hydrogenases, (ii) metalloenzymes from extreme                      
              thermophiles.  Mixed-metal hemoglobin hybrids provide the optimal              
              system for studying electron transfer within a rigid and                       
              crystallographically defined environment.  Using this system Dr.               
              Hoffman will examine the temperature response of electron                      
              transfer down to helium temperatures.  He will also probe the                  
              interfacial conformational dynamics that control a cooperative                 
              binding transition displayed by non-covalent electron transfer                 
              complexes.                                                                     
              %%%                                                                            
              Endor spectroscopy is the technique of choice for answering many               
              of the fundamental questions about the structure and function of               
              metalloenzyme active sites.  Long-range electron transfer is one               
              of the most fundamental chemical and biological reactions, yet                 
              one of the most difficult to study.
