Abstract    :
              The factors that affect the growth and decline of populations in               
              nature remain elusive, in part because the importance of social                
              interactions has been underestimated.  Community nesting behavior              
              in a salamander species and the relation to behavior and population            
              dynamics will be studied.  Specifically, it will be determined                 
              whether limited nest site plays a role in causing communal nesting,            
              and whether communal nests are the result of aggressive or                     
              cooperative interactions.  Results may indicate that existing                  
              predictive models of population growth that ignore behavior are                
              inadequate.  In addition, data derived from this detailed                      
              population study may provide insights into the causes of an                    
              apparent decline in amphibian populations in eastern forests.
