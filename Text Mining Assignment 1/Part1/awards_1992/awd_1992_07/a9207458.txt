Abstract    :
              Optical excitation of a semiconductor crystal at low temperature               
              produces mobile electrons and holes which combine to form short                
              lived excitons. Because of their light mass, excitons are                      
              candidates for a novel quantum effect called Bose-Einstein                     
              Condensation (BEC). Under intense pulsed laser excitation at low               
              temperature, excitons in high-purity single crystals of CU2O display           
              properties characteristic of quantum statistics leading to BEC. The            
              present studies will create and probe this unusual system to                   
              examine the relaxation kinetics and to attempt to produce BEC. To              
              conditions for observation will be optimized by applying stress and            
              magnetic fields to the crystal. Strain-confinement and sub-Kelvin              
              temperature will be used to produce long-lived quantum exciton gas             
              and allow the possibility of observing ballistic propagation of                
              excitons over macroscopic distances.
