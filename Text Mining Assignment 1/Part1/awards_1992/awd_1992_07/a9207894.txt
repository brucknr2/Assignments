Abstract    :
              In this project funded in the Physical Chemistry Program of the                
              Chemistry Division, Mark Johnson of Yale University will                       
              continue study the spectroscopy and dynamics of sequentially                   
              solvated anions and electrons in the gas phase.  The absorption                
              spectra, photofragmentation dynamics, and photoelectron                        
              spectroscopy of complexes with a well-defined composition in                   
              free molecular jets will be monitored using tandem                             
              time-of-flight spectroscopies.  The isomers postulated to exist                
              in the (H2O)n cluster anion system will be characterized, and                  
              the dependence of the spatial extent of the excess electron on                 
              cluster size will be determined in order to clarify the origin                 
              of charge transfer to solvent transitions of aqueous anions.                   
              Photoinduced intra-cluster reactions, including intra-cluster                  
              electron transfer and the O- + HO --> OH- + OH reaction will be                
              examined.  These systems to be studied are intermediate between                
              the solution phase and more traditional ion-molecule reaction                  
              studies and should provide valuable correlations.

              This project examines how excess charge is accommodated in                     
              finite, homogeneous media, such as aqueous solutions.  The                     
              focus of these studies is on charged aggregates of stable                      
              molecules held together by very weak forces which are more                     
              physical than chemical.  Unlike metal systems, in which the                    
              excess charge tends to be delocalized over the aggregate,                      
              different molecular systems vary widely in how they accommodate                
              the excess charge.  Insights into the behavior of dissolved                    
              species are expected to result from these studies.
