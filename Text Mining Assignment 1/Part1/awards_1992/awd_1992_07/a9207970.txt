Abstract    :
              The structures of a number of helical plant viruses will be                    
              determined at resolutions sufficient to describe the intact                    
              viruses in molecular detail, using the fiber diffraction methods               
              already used successfully in this laboratory for tobacco mosaic                
              virus (TMV) and the U2 strain of TMV.  The viruses to be studied               
              include viruses distantly related to TMV (cucumber green mottle                
              mosaic virus and ribgrass mosaic virus), and the unrelated                     
              potexvirus papaya mosaic virus (PMV).  The structure of the                    
              isolated coat protein of PMV will be determined                                
              crystallographically.  Mutants of TMV, predicted from the                      
              structure to be deficient in assembly or disassembly, will be                  
              designed here and made by collaborators.  Their assembly and                   
              disassembly properties will be studied here by electron                        
              microscopy and other measurements.  Structures of mutants showing              
              significantly changed assembly properties will be determined.                  
              %%%                                                                            
              These rod-shaped viruses are the only viruses in which the entire              
              nucleic acid genome can be seen using x-ray diffraction methods.               
              Studies of their structures are important to understanding                     
              protein-nucleic acid interactions and the processes of molecular               
              assembly and recognition in biological systems.  Assembly and                  
              recognition are essential steps in many cellular processes, as                 
              well as in the processes of viral infection and propagation.  The              
              studies proposed here are therefore relevant to a wide variety of              
              cellular systems of both medical and agricultural importance.
