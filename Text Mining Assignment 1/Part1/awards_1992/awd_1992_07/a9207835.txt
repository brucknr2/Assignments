Abstract    :
              In this project in the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program                 
              of the Chemistry Division, Patrick Vacarro of Yale University                  
              will exploit a newly developed high-resolution laser                           
              spectroscopic method to explore the ground state potential                     
              energy hypersurfaces for a number of polyatomic systems,                       
              including both stable and unstable species.  This degenerate                   
              four-wave mixing (DFWM) technique relies on the simultaneous                   
              creation and detection of transient spatial gratings within a                  
              gas-phase ensemble of molecules and offers several advantages                  
              over traditional spectroscopies.  The current project will                     
              furnish information on the structure and dynamics of molecules                 
              with very highly excited vibration-rotation levels which can                   
              lead to an enhanced understanding of the intra- and                            
              intermolecular processes involved with highly excited                          
              polyatomic species, such as predissociation and ground-state                   
              isomerism.                                                                     
              %%%                                                                            
              Polyatomic molecules which contain large amounts of energy in                  
              vibrating bonds have an important impact on a wide variety of                  
              phenomena, such as combustion diagnosis and atmospheric                        
              modelling.  This study proposes to user laser-based techniques                 
              to study small transient polyatomic molecules possessing                       
              considerable vibrational excitation to determine their behavior                
              as a result of the excess energy.
