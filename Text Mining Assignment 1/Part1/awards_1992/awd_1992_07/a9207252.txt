Abstract    :
              This research will contribute to the development of an                         
              instantaneous algorithm for active structures that include                     
              viscoelastic dampers and active bracing devices (hybrid                        
              structures).  Nonlinear behavior of the structural members shall               
              be considered. The research will show whether the hybrid active                
              structure reduces the demand on the magnitude of active control                
              forces.  The objectives of the research include the investigation              
              of active control forces at three stages: (a) for an elastic                   
              structure with the hybrid system before structural optimization,               
              (b) for a nonlinear structure with the hybrid system before                    
              structural optimization, and (c) for a nonlinear structure with the            
              hybrid system after structural optimization.
