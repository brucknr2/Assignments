Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  The purpose of this study is to document the variability of               
              the Indonesian Low Pressure System using oxygen isotope anomalies              
              recorded in annually-banded reef corals.  As the position of the               
              Indonesian Low is an index of the Southern Oscillation, these data             
              will also serve as a proxy record of the Southern Oscillation.                 
              Over 80 m of coral core have been recovered from sites in Thailand             
              and Eastern Indonesia.  Isotopic analysis of this core library can             
              provide a picture of sea surface temperature and precipitation                 
              variability across S.E. Asia for the past 200 years, with some                 
              records extending to 300 years or more.  This study will produce               
              proxy-precipitation time series that will record shifts of the                 
              Indonesian Low and changes in phase of the Southern Oscillation.               
              These time series will be analyzed for event sequences, lead/lag               
              relationships and long-term changes in spectral characteristics.
