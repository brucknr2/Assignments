Abstract    :
                   The principal investigator will continue his work on the                  
              geometry of convex sets and on some nonlinear problems associated              
              with the geometry. A major motivation for the research is a need               
              for the development of formulas of translative integral geometry.              
              The research will involve the study of certain newly discovered                
              functionals which are related to mixed volumes.                                
                   This award will support research in the general area of                   
              integral geometry. The geometry of a set may often be analyzed                 
              and described by a decomposition of the set into slices. The                   
              geometry of the slices is often fairly simple and easy to                      
              describe. The main difficulty in the analysis is usually the                   
              reconstruction of the underlying geometric features of the entire              
              set from the geometry of the slices. One well know application of              
              this area of mathematics is the CAT scan.
