Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The primary objectives of this research are:  1) to synthesize new             
              and novel materials among the metal-rich halides and chalcogenides             
              of the early transition metals, and 2) to characterize the new                 
              materials physically.  The proposed studies will feature a unique              
              group of compounds in which metal cluster and condensed cluster                
              phases are stabilized by strongly bound, interstitial elements.                
              The cluster hosts will include Sc, Y, the lanthanides, Zr, and Hf;             
              the halides will be Cl, Br, and l; the chalcogenides S and Se.                 
              Also, the solution chemistry of centered zirconium clusters will be            
              studied to provide both an understanding of their ligation                     
              reactions and routes to new solid materials.  Physical properties              
              of the interesting phases will be defined.  Emphasis will be given             
              to the nature of bonding and to infinite chain structures which                
              afford hetrometal arrays.
