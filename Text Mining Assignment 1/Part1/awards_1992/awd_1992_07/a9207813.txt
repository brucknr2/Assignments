Abstract    :
                   Detritus is present in all aquatic ecosystems and yet there               
              is still much debate about its importance in supporting the                    
              growth of large organisms, such as invertebrates and fish.                     
              For example, mangrove detritus may not be utilized directly by                 
              shrimp but it may support a rich microbial assemblage that                     
              ultimately supports shrimp growth. This study will test the                    
              hypothesis that the foodweb based on mangrove detritus is                      
              important in supporting the growth of post-larval penaeaid                     
              shrimp.  The proposed research will be carried out in a Costa                  
              Rican estuary which has large shrimp fisheries and a biological                
              station.                                                                       
                   Although early studies using stomach analysis emphasized the              
              importance of mangrove detritus in supporting shrimp growth, more              
              recent studies have challenged this.  To help resolve this                     
              controversy, stomach contents and stable isotope (C, N and S)                  
              analysis and mesocosm experiments will be conducted to examine                 
              shrimp growth and possible food chain isotope fractionation. By                
              combining tools in invertebrate biology, microbiology and                      
              geochemistry it may be possible to determine the ultimate source               
              of primary production (mangroves, phytoplankton or benthic algae)              
              supporting growth of postlarval shrimp. This research will also                
              examine whether the microbial loop, here supported by mangrove                 
              detritus, is a source or sink for the biomass production of                    
              higher trophic levels.
