Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              It is known that a hormone, luteinizing hormone (LH), produced by              
              the pituitary gland induces a number of changes in the follicular              
              wall which results in a rupture of this wall and release of the egg            
              or ovum. The goal of this proposal is to elucidate the mechanism               
              through which luteinizing hormone acting on the granulosa and theca            
              layers of preovulatory follicule induces ovulation. The hypothesis             
              to be tested is that one of the primary roles of LH in the                     
              induction of ovulation in the hen involves production of the                   
              plasminogen activator and collagenase. These key enzymes either                
              dissociate or degrade the fibers in the stigma region. This                    
              research will lead to new fundamental findings.
