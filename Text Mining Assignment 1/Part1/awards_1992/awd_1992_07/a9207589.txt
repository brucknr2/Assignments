Abstract    :
              This facilities project at the Hopkins Marine Station,                         
              Stanford University, involves the construction of a                            
              versatile sea water laboratory/culture facility.  The                          
              project is motivated by the recognition that marine                            
              organisms provide unique model systems for biomedical,                         
              ecological, and evolution research and the importance of                       
              these systems is continually expanding.  The laboratory will                   
              be an enclosed structure suitable for culturing marine                         
              specimens, maintaining cloned species, containing transgenic                   
              organisms, and for conduction experiments under controlled                     
              conditions.  The building is single storied with a 50X40 ft.                   
              footprint and it is sited adjacent to existing seawater                        
              delivery and outlet         pipes.  It will be of masonry                      
              construction with tile roof and cement slab floor.  The                        
              interior space is divided into two rooms by a central wall                     
              and connecting doors.  The interior design is very flexible                    
              in order to accommodate new experiments or containment needs                   
              as they arise.  Special equipment such as water chillers,                      
              sterilization equipment, tank racks, video monitoring will                     
              be the responsibility of the individual laboratories using                     
              the flexible space.  The new laboratory/culture facility                       
              will enhance         the current research program at the                       
              Hopkins Marine Station and open exciting new research                          
              opportunities.
