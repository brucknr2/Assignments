Abstract    :
              A loading frame will be purchased for projects involving the use               
              of two dimensional and three dimensional computer vision to study              
              the surface deformation near a growing crack and a static crack,               
              and optical measurements of strain at high temperatures near                   
              1000oC.  The research will extend strain measurement techniques                
              to lower size scales to study deformation and fracture phenomena               
              at the grain scale.
