Abstract    :
              In this project, the PI will collect water samples to measure                  
              helium isotopes and tritium on seven sections in the Pacific,                  
              contributing a tracer component as part of the World Ocean                     
              Circulation Experiment (WOCE) Hydrographic Program (WHP).  The                 
              overall goal of the WHP is to determine the long-term mean                     
              thermohaline and wind-driven ocean circulation and its relation to             
              climate change.  The He-3/Tr pair provides a means of determining              
              the age of shallow waters on time scales of months to decades.
