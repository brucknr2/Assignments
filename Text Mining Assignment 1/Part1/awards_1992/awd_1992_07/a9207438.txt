Abstract    :
              This applicant will study DNA mismatch repair, which                           
              contributes to maintenance of genetic stability by                             
              eliminating DNA biosynthetic errors and by blocking                            
              recombination between DNA sequences that differ by more than                   
              1% at the nucleotide level.  Specifically, he plans to work                    
              on the biochemical basis for the anti-recombination                            
              associated with mismatch corrections in E. coli.  This work                    
              is planned to take place in the laboratory of Dr. Paul                         
              Modrich at Duke University.
