Abstract    :
                   The Numerical Anlysis group of the School of Mathematics of               
              the Georgia Institute of Technology will purchase three                        
              workstations  and related software.                                            
                   The new equipment will be entirely dedicated to the support               
              of the research in Numerical Analysis.  The acquisition will                   
              greatly decrease the load on the existing computing facilities,                
              and it will allow the group of numerical analysts and their                    
              graduate students to carry out several research projects,                      
              including in particular:                                                       
              1. Approximation of Invariant Manifolds,                                       
              2. Aspects of Adaptive Integration of IVPs of ODEs,                            
              3. Adaptive Numerical Methods for Reaction-Diffusion PdEs,                     
              4. Front Tracking and Domain Decomposition Techniques for Free                 
              Boundary Value Problems,                                                       
               5. Numerical Apsects of the Hysteresis Phenomena.
