Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This research involves population and behavioral studies of the                
              superb fairy-wren, a species of bird that lives in Australia.  This            
              work will contribute to our knowledge about the biology of this                
              species and the avifauna of Australia generally.  More important,              
              it will add to our understanding of evolutionary processes                     
              affecting reproductive biology and social behavior of nonhuman                 
              species.                                                                       
                                                                                             
              Superb fairy-wrens are interesting because they live in large                  
              social groups, the offspring from one generation remain in the                 
              territory and help the parents raise young in successive breeding              
              attempts, and social mates are often related to each other.  This              
              great potential for inbreeding among closely related individuals               
              appears to have been solved by fairy-wrens in what may be a unique             
              manner:  females in each group mate promiscuously with males from              
              other groups.  This research is attempting to verify and study the             
              mechanisms by which individual fairy-wrens avoid inbreeding and the            
              relationship between the species' mating system and the patterns of            
              morphology and plumage coloration.  As the research uses molecular             
              techniques in determining the patterns of mating, the work will                
              also add to our knowledge of genetic variation within and among                
              families in this species, and the use of DNA fingerprinting as a               
              means of identifying sires of offspring.
