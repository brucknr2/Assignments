Abstract    :
              To gain a better understanding of the storage process in plants,               
              the PIs will study plants that have evolved in an ecosystem in                 
              which storage is obviously useful.  The alpine environment is one              
              in which such a condition exists.  Alpine plants provide unique                
              opportunities to study the advantages and costs of resource storage            
              to plants.  The PIs will use alpine plants as model systems to                 
              study storage as a general phenomenon.  The study will yield new               
              information on how storage benefits growth of these plants, what               
              its costs are in terms of future growth, and how plants can conduct            
              storage in a competitive environment where soil microorganisms use             
              the same resources.  The questions addressed in this proposal have             
              several practical implications.  First, by studying plant survival             
              in harsh ecosystems, the PIs will learn about adaptations that                 
              could be useful for plants in agricultural systems.  Second, a                 
              basic understanding of soil nitrogen transformations can have a                
              practical application in agricultural ecosystems.  Finally, the                
              approach developed will provide useful information on processes in             
              alpine ecosystems, an area that may prove quite susceptible to                 
              global warming and other climate changes.
