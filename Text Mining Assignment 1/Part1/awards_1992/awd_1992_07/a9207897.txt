Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The major assumption of isothermal changes in the "old"                        
              liquid-phase sintering model is notsuitable for the actual                     
              processings.  This project proposes to use the transmission                    
              electron microscope (TEM) to observe the actual nanometer                      
              events.  The observed TEM data will be used to change the "old"                
              quantitative expressions as developed by Kingery in 1959.                      
              Observations of microsctructural changes and rates of change                   
              during the heating-up process, with emphasis on material                       
              distribution and distribution changes, will be made.  Quantitative             
              expressions will be formulated for the processes during the                    
              heating-up process with additives.  These processes develop                    
              ultimately into liquid-phase sintering.  The study will begin with             
              the Al2O3-TiO2 system.                                                         
              %%%%                                                                           
              This project examines the heating-up process with the presence                 
              of actives.  Microscopic observations in nanoscales will be made               
              of the microstructural changes and their rates of change with                  
              emphasis on material distribution and distribution changes.  The               
              study begins with the hypothesis that the focal point should be on             
              the distribution, crystallinity, and properties of boundaries and              
              surface "phases", which are present to allow acclerated material               
              transfer.  This study challenges the applications of the quantitative          
              expressions the PI developed many years ago.  This study aims                  
              to develop new expressions which will have a profound effect in                
              catalyzing rapid and innovative advances, not only in ceramic                  
              processing, but also in ceramic sciences as well as in powder                  
              metallurgy.
