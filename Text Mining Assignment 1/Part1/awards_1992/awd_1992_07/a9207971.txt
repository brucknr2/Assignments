Abstract    :
              This research builds on previous studies of shared-memory                      
              multiprocessors by using the IEEE proposed Scalable Coherent                   
              Interface as a research platform.  Multiprocessor issues are                   
              studied both at the logical level and the cache coherence                      
              level.  Important problems at the logical level include study                  
              of the performance of a single SCI ring as well as multiple                    
              rings, the properties of pipelined networks, and appropriate                   
              topologies for connecting simple rings together to create                      
              large-scale systems.  Important problems at the cache                          
              coherence level include enhancements to the shared-memory                      
              model to provide for efficient synchronization, extensions to                  
              the SCI coherence protocol and the benefit of relaxing event                   
              ordering constraints in the memory system.
