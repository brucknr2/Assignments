Abstract    :
                   The Crustacea are a large and morphologically diverse group of            
              freshwater and marine animals whose evolutionary relationships are             
              controversial.  Dr. Larry Abele at Florida State University and                
              colleagues are employing modern molecular analyses of DNA to obtain            
              nucleotide sequence data from representative samples of many groups            
              of barnacles, crabs, copepods, shrimps, and others.  They can thus             
              acquire comparable, homologous characters for the reconstruction of            
              phylogenetic branching patterns among these various crustacean                 
              lineages.  In turn such knowledge will permit testing of ideas                 
              about morphological diversification in these animals, geographic               
              distribution, and ecological specialization.
