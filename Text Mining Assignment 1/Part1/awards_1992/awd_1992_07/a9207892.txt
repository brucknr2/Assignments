Abstract    :
                   Although size and stage-structured populations are                        
              ubiquitous in natural communities few studies have examined their              
              ecological consequences.  Bluegill, the most common fish species               
              in many small lakes throughout North America, have populations                 
              that are functionally stage-structured, with juveniles feeding on              
              soft-bodied littoral invertebrates and adults feeding on limnetic              
              zooplankton.  The proposed research will test the hypothesis that              
              bluegill populations link dynamics of littoral and limnetic                    
              habitats via their stage-structured habitat use and thus provide               
              a central focus about which the rest of the fish community is                  
              organized.  The research will examine processes responsible for                
              among-lake variation in the production of large Daphnia, the                   
              primary resource of adult bluegill and the factor that explains                
              among-lake variation in bluegill density and growth. Competition               
              between juvenile bluegill and a suite of littoral fish species,                
              including largemouth bass, will be examined using a combination                
              of comparative lake surveys and experimental tests.  The research              
              will provide general understanding of the mechanisms and                       
              consequences of stage-structured interactions, and can help guide              
              the development of specific management strategies for warm-water               
              fisheries.
