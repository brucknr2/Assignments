Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This an investigation of the topological and electronic                        
              behavior of promoted and unpromoted molybdenum disulfide                       
              crystals using state-of-the-art scanning tunnelling                            
              microscopy (STM) and scanning tunnelling spectroscopy (STS)                    
              techniques.  Measurements are made both under ultrahigh vacuum                 
              and under atmospheric conditions in order to follow changes in                 
              the catalyst surface.  The goals of the effort are (1) using                   
              STM, to characterize the molybdenum disulfide single-crystal                   
              surface before and after sputtering, and to contrast this to                   
              sulfided molybdenum(100) and molybdenum disulfide on graphite;                 
              (2) to investigate the effect of cobalt on the morphology and                  
              on the electronic structure of molybdenum disulfide under                      
              various loadings; (3) to study the adsorption and dissociation                 
              characteristics of probe molecules such as thiophene,                          
              dithiophene, and benzothiophene on molybdenum disulfide,                       
              cobalt-promoted molybdenum disulfide, and molybdenum disulfide                 
              on graphite; and (4) to follow the sulfidation process of                      
              molybdenum(100) and molybdenum oxide on graphite.  The data                    
              are interpreted in terms of nature of reaction sites and                       
              reaction mechanisms in hydrodesulfurization (HDS) catalysis.                   
                                                                                             
              This study involves the application of a new battery of                        
              techniques (tunnelling microscopy) to a classical problem                      
              (hydrosulfurization) with potential benefits for both.                         
              Although there has been little advance in HDS in the last two                  
              decades, environmental pressures are forcing it to the                         
              forefront of interest again.  Although widely practiced, the                   
              process is still poorly understood, and even incremental                       
              improvements could have a major impact.
