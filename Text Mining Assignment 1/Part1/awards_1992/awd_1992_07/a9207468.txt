Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This X-Ray facility will provide a rotating anode x-ray generator              
              with accessories, a four-circle diffractometer and a two-circle                
              diffractometer to scientists at the University of California, Santa            
              Barbara.  Research projects include studies of self-assembled                  
              biomaterials, polymer liquid crystals and copolymers, small angle              
              x-ray reflectivity of thin complex fluid films, wide bandgap                   
              semiconductors, thin film and bulk ferroelectric oxides.  This                 
              facility will provide a much needed high intensity source for                  
              material characterization and will complement facilities to be                 
              provided through the new Materials Research Laboratory being                   
              established at the University.  This facility is being made                    
              available to all qualified users, and will provide first-hand                  
              experience to students and faculty.
