Abstract    :
                   The design of this proposal brings strengths from molecular               
              biology, cytogenetics, and cladistics to test the hypothesis that              
              rapid chromosomal change and karyotypic stasis are primarily                   
              mediated at the molecular level by activity of repetitive                      
              sequences.  We predict that taxa with radically reorganized                    
              karyotypes will have:  1) an abundance of copies and classes of                
              rapidly evolving repetitive sequences;2) tandemly repeated                     
              sequences will have actively changed chromosomal fields among                  
              nonhomologous chromosomes; and 3) interspersed repeated sequences              
              will have undergone changes in sequence and copy number due to                 
              transposition.  Alternatively, lineages experiencing long periods              
              of karyotypic stasis will have:  1) fewer classes of tandemly                  
              repeated sequences is low copy number; 2) tandemly repeated                    
              sequences restricted to specific chromosomal regions; and 3)                   
              interspersed elements will evolve at a rate similar to that of                 
              other neutral DNA, due to a lower rate of transposition.  New                  
              World leaf-nosed bats were chosen because monophyly of taxa to be              
              studied is well documented and they exhibit extremes in rates and              
              types of karyotypic evolution.  Methods of examination will                    
              include phylogenetic screening of genome libraries to determine                
              the number and kind of rapidly evolving repetitive sequences.                  
              Chromosomal position and movement will be documented by                        
              cladistical analysis of data from in situ hybridization.
