Abstract    :
              Bdelloid rotifers are common fresh-water invertebrates comprising              
              4 families, numerous genera and hundreds of species.  Neither males            
              nor meiosis are known within the Class.  Although remarkable, this             
              does not exclude rare or unrecognized forms of genetic exchange.               
              A more rigorous test is therefor required.  The proposed                       
              investigation depends on the expectation that a diploid line that              
              lost sexual reproduction and genetic recombination far back in its             
              evolution will accumulate a much higher level of silent-site                   
              heterozygosity than a sexually reproducing line.  For a given gene,            
              heterozygosity will be measured by comparing the nucleotide                    
              sequences of its two homologues cloned from the DNA of a rotifer               
              population grown from a single egg.  Such tests will be done with              
              a number of different genes and different bdelloid families and                
              genera.  Bdelloid DNA will also be examined for mobile genetic                 
              elements, in order to test the possible association between sexual             
              reproduction and the load of insertion mutations.  For comparison,             
              heterozygosity and mobile elements will also be investigated in                
              monogononts, a class of rotifers in which sexual reproduction and              
              meiosis are known.                                                             
              %%%                                                                            
              The usual and accepted view is that without sex and recombination,             
              evolution and adaptive success is not possible.  That hypothesis,              
              however, has been impossible to test.  The availability of Bdelloid            
              rotifers and recombinant DNA technology have changed that and this             
              work may make it possible to find a more definitive answer to a                
              fundamental question in genetics.
