Abstract    :
                   The Solanaceae, or tomato family, is one of the world's most              
              economically important plant families, and includes the large and              
              diverse genus Solanum, thought to encompass some 1500 to 2000                  
              species.  Despite its importance, phylogenetic relationships in                
              the Solanaceae as a whole and particularly those in Solanum are                
              poorly understood.  This project will examine phylogenetic                     
              relationships in the subfamily Solanoideae of the Solanaceae,                  
              concentrating on sectional classification in Solanum.  Previous                
              research has shown the Solanoideae to be a monophyletic group                  
              derived from the solanaceous subfamily Cestroideae.  Data sets to              
              be used in phylogenetic reconstruction include restriction                     
              fragment variation and DNA sequence information.  Species will be              
              chosen from as many sections of Solanum as possible, with broader              
              representation from genera in the subfamily Solanoideae.  Trees                
              will be rooted using the Cestroideae as the outgroup.  The goal                
              of this study is to provide a phylogenetic framework for the                   
              subfamily, which will focus further systematic work on the group               
              at finer levels and provide working hypotheses of relationships                
              for assessment of character polarity and examination of                        
              biogeographic patterns,
