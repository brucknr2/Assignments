Abstract    :
              When Escherichia coli cells exhaust a nutrient, they cease dividing            
              and enter a non-growing state.  When nutrients are restored, the               
              cells can resume growth quickly.  Even after several weeks of                  
              starvation, many cells in a culture retain this ability to resume              
              growth whn conditions become more favorable. Molecular analysis of             
              the events that occur upon entry into the stationary phase, during             
              prolonged starvation, and during the resumption of growth, have                
              revealed some of the regulatory mechanisms that starved cell                   
              utilize in order to survive.  This work continues to expand our                
              understanding of stationary phase physiology.  We will analyze the             
              regulation of transcription form two stationary phase-ducible                  
              promoters.  To study the starvation signal transduction pathway, we            
              will isolate conditional mutations that cause E. coli cells to                 
              express starvation-specific genes during exponential growth.  We               
              will also investigate the role of a novel starvation-specific                  
              histone-like protein, VTM, in maintaining the endogenous metabolic             
              activity of starved cells for resumption of exponential growth                 
              starvation.

              This work addresses a fundamental question in the physiology of                
              bacteria: how do bacteria respond to and survive periods of                    
              prolonged starvation.
