Abstract    :
              The mathematical structure of the collective excitations of model              
              neural networks will be examined for the relevance which they may              
              have to the essential aspects of "higher nervous function."  An                
              examination of this subject requires that much be known about the              
              pattern of connections between nerve cells.  Since this cannot be              
              provided directly from neurobiological experiments, we will work               
              with the case of associative memory, where the nature of the                   
              connections is believed to be due to the structure in the                      
              information provided by the external world.  The nature of the                 
              collective properties is expected to depend on the topology of the             
              underlying neural circuits.  The fundamental question is whether               
              the interactions between any collective excitations have useful                
              computational properties.
