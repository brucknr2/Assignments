Abstract    :
                   In this project, group-theoretic and geometric methods will               
              be applied to dynamical systems.  An analysis from a geometric                 
              point of view will be given for a nonlinear system modelling the               
              evolution of baroclinic amplitude pressure waves in the                        
              atmosphere.                                                                    
                   Nonlinear phenomena can be modelled by dynamical systems.                 
              Small changes or errors in initial data can lead to dramatic even              
              chaotic behavior at a later time. The prediction of weather is                 
              such an example.
