Abstract    :
              The objectives of this research is                                             
              to create the scientific                                                       
              infrastructure for the development                                             
              of a new, novel, high-performance                                              
              neuroprosthetic technology in the                                              
              area of electrical stimulation of                                              
              the extremities.  To do this the                                               
              investigator will: 1) determine the                                            
              dynamic performance of various                                                 
              skeletal muscles; 2) investigate                                               
              the use of the EMG as a force                                                  
              feedback signal in a closed-loop                                               
              control system; 3) study the                                                   
              relationships of the agonist and                                               
              antagonist muscles for use in a                                                
              push -pull stimulation scheme; and                                             
              4) implement a synergistic control                                             
              system using muscle stimulation on                                             
              an animal model.                                                               
                                                                                             
              The significance of the development                                            
              of such technological                                                          
              infrastructure is the potential                                                
              ability to provide individuals who                                             
              become paralyzed after spinal cord                                             
              injury with the ability to function                                            
              independently under voluntary                                                  
              control using fully implantable                                                
              neuroprosthetic stimulators.  These                                            
              stimulators will allow individuals                                             
              to walk, in cases of paraplegia, or                                            
              to use their arms, in cases of                                                 
              quadriplegia.
