Abstract    :
              The International Institute for Applied Systems                                
              Analysis (IIASA) in Laxenburg, Austria, is an                                  
              international research institution supported by                                
              National Member Organizations in 15 countries,                                 
              including the United States, Russia, Eastern and                               
              Western European nations, Japan, and Canada.  The                              
              focus of its research is on complex, policy-relevant                           
              problems that transcend the interests of single                                
              countries.  The U.S. National Committee for IIASA,                             
              comprised of distinguished scientists and policy                               
              experts, has been important to the implementation of a                         
              December 1989 Presidential determination that IIASA's                          
              research directions should be redirected towards                               
              issues of concern to the United States, with a                                 
              specific emphasis on global change research.  In                               
              particular, the Committee was instrumental in helping                          
              to develop a 10-year strategic plan which was                                  
              officially adopted by the IIASA Council in June 1991.                          
              This grant will permit the Committee to continue and                           
              intensify its activities by: (1) providing support for                         
              its Executive Directorate, housed at the American                              
              Academy of Arts and Sciences in Cambridge,                                     
              Massachusetts; (2) funding domestic travel for members                         
              to participate in meetings of the committee; (3)                               
              funding foreign travel to permit qualified U.S.                                
              scientists to make short-term visits to IIASA as a                             
              means for addressing an objective of the committee to                          
              intensify involvement of the U.S. scientific community                         
              in IIASA's work; and (4) supporting the participation                          
              of up to eight outstanding advanced U.S. graduate                              
              students in IIASA's Young Scientist Program during the                         
              summer of 1992.
