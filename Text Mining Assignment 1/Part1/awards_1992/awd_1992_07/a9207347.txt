Abstract    :
                   The goal of this project is to develop and analyze interior-              
              point algorithms for solving large-scale linear programs (LP),                 
              quadratic programs (QP), linear complementarity problems (LCP).                
              This research is a continuation of previous work and is motivated              
              by the desire to resolve several theoretical and practical issues              
              concerning interior-point algorithms:  (1) Algorithm Termination:              
              to develop efficient termination techniques to "purify" an                     
              approximate optimal solution to an (exact) optimal solution, and               
              to improve the complexity result for a class of optimization                   
              problems.  (2)  Average Complexity:  to analyze the complexity of              
              interior-point algorithms for solving random problems, and to                  
              probabilisticly explain the excellent practical behavior of                    
              interior-point algorithms. (3)  Asymptotic Convergence:  to develop            
              and analyze superlinearly convergent interior-point algorithms, and            
              to improve the algorithms' global and asymptotic complexity                    
              results.  (4)  Decomposition and Column Generation:  to develop                
              various decomposition and column generation schemes for solving                
              large-scale practical problems using interior-point algorithms.                
                  This project will strengthen some of the results from prior NSF            
              research and explore new techniques and tools for analyzing and                
              improving interior-point algorithms.  It will also include                     
              developing computer routines for solving application problems                  
              arisen in production scheduling and resource allocation.
