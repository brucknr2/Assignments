Abstract    :
              Tan                                                                             
                                                                                            
              This award will provide supplementary support                                  
              to enable Dr. Robin Tan of the University of                                   
              Wisconsin, Madison, to conduct collaborative                                   
              research with Dr. Masato Tanaka for 24 months                                  
              at the National Chemical Laboratory for                                        
              Industry in Tsukuba, Japan.  Tan and Tanaka                                    
              will utilize Tan's expertise in silicon                                        
              chemistry to synthesize new organosilicon                                      
              compounds.                                                                     
                                                                                             
              With future applications for lithography, new                                  
              organosilicon compounds can be used to develop                                 
              new polymeric materials.  Tan and Tanaka                                       
              propose a new method to synthesize                                             
              organosilicon species by utilizing low valent                                  
              metal complexes as catalysts.  By varying the                                  
              starting silicon and unsaturated organic                                       
              compounds, they will be able to form many novel                                
              organosilicon compounds which will serve as                                    
              important starting materials in the synthesis                                  
              of silicon-based polymeric materials.                                          
              Dr. Tanaka's experience in silicon-based                                       
              polymeric materials and the instrumentation                                    
              available in his laboratory will complement Dr.                                
              Tan's experience in synthesizing organometallic                                
              compounds.  Dr. Tanaka's laboratory is                                         
              participating in a national Japanese government                                
              project on silicon chemicals and silicon-based                                 
              materials.
