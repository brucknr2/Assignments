Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This grant provides for partial funding of the acquisition of a                
              fluorimeter to be used in studies of physical-chemical studies of              
              macromolecules, spectroscopic properties of lanthanide complexes,              
              and luminescence studies of inorganic crystals.
