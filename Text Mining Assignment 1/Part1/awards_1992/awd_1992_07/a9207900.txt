Abstract    :
                   This work will study a variational method for producing                   
              upper bounds for energy levels of lattice Hamiltonian systems.                 
              The long term goal is to make lattice calculations, which are                  
              widely used in theoretical physics computations, more                          
              efficient and accurate.
