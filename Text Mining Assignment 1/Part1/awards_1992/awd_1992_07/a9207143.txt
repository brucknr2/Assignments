Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This project involves the dissertation research of an                          
              anthropology student from the University of Michigan.  The                     
              student will study changes in the social stratification of a                   
              village in a developing area of Sri Lanka.   Using baseline data               
              from the 1960s, the student will get life histories, practice                  
              participant observation, and analyze daily linguistic                          
              interactions to assess changes in the underlying principles of                 
              caste, class, and gender as they affect changes in social                      
              stratification.                                                                
                                                                                             
              This project is important because it will provide a case study of              
              changes in social stratification in one village in Sri Lanka that              
              are mirrored in many traditional societies of the world.                       
              Understanding the affect of new economic opportunities on old                  
              hierarchies of gender and caste dominance can help policy makers               
              ameliorate the problems created by rapid social and economic                   
              change.
