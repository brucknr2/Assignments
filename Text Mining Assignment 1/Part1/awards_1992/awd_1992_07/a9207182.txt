Abstract    :
                   Two of the major participants in the Bletchley Park work                  
              in breaking the World War II German High Command "Enigma                       
              Codes" are present at Virginia Tech during the Spring                          
              semester 1992.  The University plans to conduct a series of                    
              four hour-long oral interviews of Dr. I.J. Good and Dr.                        
              Donald Michie concerning their involvement in the Bletchley                    
              Park activities, decryption and early computing developments                   
              during World War II, and their contributions to statistics,                    
              computing sciences and artificial intelligence since 1945.                     
                                                                                             
              The principal investigator has arranged for experienced                        
              writers and professionals skilled in oral interviewing with                    
              computer pioneers to participate in this oral history                          
              project.  It is expected that the resulting collection of                      
              archival material will result in several publications in the                   
              Communications of the ACM, the Annals of the History of                        
              Computing and other journals associated with the intelligence                  
              and statistics communities.  Elements of the set of                            
              interviews will also be considered for inclusion in TV and                     
              Radio series.                                                                  
                                                                                             
              This award is for travel funds and subsistence                                 
              during the interview period for the interviewers.  Partial                     
              support is also being provided by Virginia Tech, the Virginia                  
              Academy of Sciences, the Association for Computing Machinery,                  
              and the American Statistical Association.//
