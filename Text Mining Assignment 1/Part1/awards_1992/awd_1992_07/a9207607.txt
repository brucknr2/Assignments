Abstract    :
                   This grant is for continued support of research aimed at                  
              the study of the microscopic structure of the proton using a                   
              new facility (HERA) in Hamburg, Germany.  The investigator and                 
              her collaborators have built a large particle detector (ZEUS)                  
              which is recording the head on collisions of electrons and                     
              protons, both of which have been accelerated in HERA to very                   
              high energies.                                                                 
                   The investigator's major role up to this time has been to                 
              provide a calibration of the calorimeter.  Her continued                       
              activities are now to concentrate upon the collection of data,                 
              and beginning of analysis.  She also plans to complete                         
              analysis of data from the Mark III spectrometer which was used                 
              at SLAC to study the decays of the psi particles into a number                 
              of rare modes.
