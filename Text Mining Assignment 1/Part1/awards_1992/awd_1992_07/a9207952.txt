Abstract    :
                   This award supports participation at the Light Cone                       
              Quantization Conference, Dallas, Texas May 26-29, 1992.  This                  
              conference will focus on a procedure of quantizing field                       
              theories that may be a great practical value in relating the                   
              nuclear force to the underlying QCD field theory.
