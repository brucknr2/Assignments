Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The aims of this proposal are to identify the genes that regulate              
              formation of the anteroposterior (A/P) axis in the ectoderm of                 
              the frog, Xenopus laevis. The ectoderm gives rise to both neural               
              tissues (including the brain and spinal cord) and to non-neural                
              tissues (such as the cement- and hatching glands). These tissues               
              are induced by signals arising from the mesoderm and by                        
              intraectodermal interactions. Previous results showed that the                 
              ectoderm acquired an A/P pattern many hours before terminal                    
              differentiation begins. Very little is known about the molecular               
              basis for this patterning in any vertebrate. This information is               
              crucial to understanding the early genetic events that regulate                
              ectodermal patterning during vertebrate development. Two                       
              approaches to analyzing A/P ectodermal patterning will be taken.               
              1. The function of the gene Xhox.lab1 will be analyzed by                      
              misexpression and functional ablation. Xhox.lab1 is a novel                    
              homeodomain containing gene that is expressed in posterior                     
              ectoderm early during A/P patterning. 2. Other genes expressed                 
              soon after ectodermal induction will be isolated by subtractive                
              hybridization between microdissected induced and uninduced                     
              ectoderm.
