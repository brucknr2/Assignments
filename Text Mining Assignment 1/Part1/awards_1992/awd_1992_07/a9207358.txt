Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Acyclic diene metathesis polymerization was demonstrated late in               
              1988 by the authors using metathesis catalysts free of Lewis acids             
              (Schrock's catalyst).  Aliphatic and aromatic homo- and copolymers             
              have thus been made.  Monomer structure/reactivity relationships               
              have been established; and unsaturated polymers containing                     
              functional groups have been prepared, including unsaturated                    
              polyethers, polyketones, polyesters, polycarbonates, and                       
              polycarbosilanes.  An air-stable metathesis catalyst and oligomers             
              of metal-containing polymers have been prepared.  In this research,            
              the polymer chemistry associated with the reaction will be explored            
              by evaluating the influence of nitrogen- and sulfur-containing                 
              functional groups; and by synthesizing chiral polymers, more                   
              elaborate silicon-containing polymers, and perfectly functionalized            
              telechelic oligomers.  Attempts will be made to advance this                   
              research by synthesizing tailored catalyst systems possessing a                
              high degree of thermal stability.                                              
                                                                                             
              This Materials Synthesis and Processing grant is jointly funded by             
              the Division of Materials Research and the Division of Chemistry.
