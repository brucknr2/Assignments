Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                                                                                             
                                                                                            
              This proposal describes research required to prepare and certify               
              reference materials for the quality control of measurements of the             
              parameters of the oceanic carbon dioxide system.  Such reference               
              materials are essential to ensure adequate quality control of the              
              measurements planned as part of the JGOFS studies.  The reference              
              materials proposed encompass all the four parameters of the oceanic            
              CO2 system: total dissolved inorganic carbon, total alkalinity, pH             
              and the fugacity of CO2 in equilibrium with a water sample.                    
              Additional work proposed is relevant to the final goal of obtaining            
              comparable and accurate measurements by a variety of different                 
              times during JGOFS.  In particular, collaborative studies of the               
              various methods, so as to develop reliable well-tested procedures              
              for sea-going use will be organized and reported on.
