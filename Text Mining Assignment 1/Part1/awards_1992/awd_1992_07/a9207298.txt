Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The pitutary gonadotropin hormones, luteinizing hormone (LH) and               
              follicle stimulating hormone (FSH), play an essential role in                  
              mammalian development and normal reproductive function.  These two             
              gonadotropin hormones are composed of two subunits, a common                   
              alpha-subunit and a beta-subunit which is unique and confers                   
              specificity.  Dr. Attardi has demonstrated that gonadotropin                   
              releasing hormone, a hormone found in the hypothalamus of the                  
              brain, and the gonadal hormones, inhibin, activin and follistatin,             
              cause rapid and profound effects on the synthesis of FSH but not               
              LH.  These changes are mediated through alternation in the                     
              messenger RNA which codes for the beta-subunit of the FSH protein.             
              Dr. Attardi will examine whether these effects result from changes             
              in synthesis rate of messanger RNA for FSH beta-subunit or from                
              changes in stability of the FSH beta-subunit molecules.  The                   
              results from these studies will help elucidate how hypothalamic and            
              gonadal hormones regulate gonadotropin synthesis and secretion.                
              This will increase our understanding of how pituitary cells                    
              communicate among themselves as well as with hypothalamic neurons              
              and cells in the ovaries and testes.  Moreover, the results could              
              lead to the development of safer and more effective methods of                 
              fertility control and increased ability to diagnose and treat                  
              problems of infertility.
