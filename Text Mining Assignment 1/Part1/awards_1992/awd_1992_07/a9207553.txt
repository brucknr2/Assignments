Abstract    :
                   This is a study of the evolutionary history of a group of                 
              South american passerine birds,t he subfamily Furnariinae or                   
              ovenbirds.  During geological history, when South America was                  
              isolated from the other continents by water barriers, this group               
              underwent a remarkable adaptive radiation into a variety of                    
              ecological roles which, in other parts of the world, are filled by             
              members of many other families.  The comparative anatomy of                    
              the hindlimb musculature and external morphology, including the                
              bill, nostrils, feet, and tail, will be studied by dissection and              
              observation of museum specimens.  anatomical variations will be                
              described and illustrated, and the direction in which characters               
              evolved will be determined.  Using this information the phylogeny              
              of pattern of common descent will be generated by computer.  This              
              will reveal how different groups, evolving separately, have                    
              developed adaptation for similar ways of life in parallel.  From               
              the conclusions reached, the evolutionary history of the ovenbirds             
              will be clarified, the classification will be revised, and the                 
              insight will be gained into the mechanisms and limitations of the              
              evolutionary process.
