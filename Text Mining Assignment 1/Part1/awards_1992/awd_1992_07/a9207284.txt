Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Research will be carried out on a method of centrifugal size                   
              separation of particles or macromolecules in a mixture. The                    
              device is a cascade of narrow channels formed by a stack of                    
              slotted cones, all rotating. Three components of the research                  
              are: physical experiments, numerical simulation, and                           
              theoretical analysis.                                                          
                                                                                             
              This fundamental research will set the stage for industrial                    
              development of an ultra centrifuge spectrometer with varied                    
              and widespread applications in separation of mixtures.
