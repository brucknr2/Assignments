Abstract    :
              This award is made in the Advanced Materials and Processing                    
              Program by the Chemistry Division in support of Dr. Andrew                     
              Barron's research on gallium and indium chalcogenide molecules,                
              phases and applications. Specifically, Group III/VI complexes                  
              will be prepared with geometries which will transform into                     
              predictable solid phases upon thermal chemical vapor                           
              deposition. Additionally, deposition of these new solid phases                 
              on gallium arsenide semiconductor surfaces will provide                        
              lattice-matched films that will passivate the surface. As an                   
              example, gallium sulfide precursors have been prepared which                   
              form a new cubic phase of gallium sulfide. The goal of the                     
              research is to extend these results, including the electronic                  
              characterization of, and development of applications for, the                  
              new cubic phase. New metalorganic chalcogenide compounds of                    
              indium and gallium will be synthesized and used for growth of                  
              indium and gallium chalcogenide thin films, both of known and                  
              new phases. An ultimate goal is the fabrication and testing of                 
              actual devices based on these films.

              This research will extend both the fundamental chemistry and                   
              the practical photovoltaic and optoelectronic applications of                  
              new III/VI solid state materials.
