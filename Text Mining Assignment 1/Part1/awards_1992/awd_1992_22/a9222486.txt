Abstract    :
              9222486  Pearson  This proposal is concerned with developing theory and 
              computational tools that will aid in the design of hybrid systems 
              (e.g.,continuous-time plants, discrete-time compensators).  In  particular it
              is concerned with problems in which the objectives  will be to minimize maximum
              error magnitudes and rates of change,  when input signals have bounded
              magnitudes and rates of change.   In addition to developing methods for nominal
              optimization  problems, the proposal is also concerned with developing 
              efficient methods to treat robust design, i.e. optimization under  plant
              uncertainty.  ***
