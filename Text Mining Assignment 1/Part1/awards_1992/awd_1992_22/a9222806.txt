Abstract    :
                   A massively parallel computing system which will be dedicated             
              to support research in computer science will be purchased.  The                
              equipment will be used for several research projects including in              
              particular:                                                                    
                                                                                             
              Signal processing and data analysis employing fast Fourier                     
              transform algorithms for non-abelian groups and homogeneous spaces             
              and wavelet and other phase space techniques.  Experimentation with            
              parallel implementation is an important new direction for this                 
              work.  Applications in medical imaging are emerging from this                  
              effort.                                                                        
                                                                                             
              Building a prototype checkpointing system for multiprocessor file              
              systems on massively parallel computers, with follow-on-research in            
              interfaces, caching and prefetching, workload studies, and remote              
              heterogeneous file system access.                                              
                                                                                             
              Development of virtual memory for data-parallel computing with                 
              applications in scientific computing.                                          
                                                                                             
              Applications in image processing involving ongoing projects in                 
              human brain labeling, fossil leaf classification, handwriting                  
              analysis, and simulation of visual attention.                                  
                                                                                             
              Implementation of PRAM algorithms aimed at elimination of                      
              concurrent references to memory in implementations on a massively              
              parallel synchronous computer, using techniques taken from work of             
              the current researchers in new algorithms for the PRAM model.
