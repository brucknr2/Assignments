Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This project provides funding for conferences to be held at                    
              Northwestern University during the summers of 1993, 1994, and 1995.            
              Each will consist of two week-long workshops, one concentrating on             
              theoretical issues in macroeconomics and the other on                          
              microeconomics.  To promote interaction, a group of researchers in             
              different but related fields will be invited to each of the                    
              workshops.                                                                     
                                                                                             
              The topics for the three years will vary.  For the first year, the             
              topics on the macro side will be politics and growth, local                    
              externalities of human capital, dynamics of the labor market,                  
              monetary policy and welfare and technological innovation and                   
              growth.  On the micro side, the topics will be the economic theory             
              of organizations, and the design of contracts.                                 
                                                                                             
              Topics for the second and third years will be decided later.  On               
              the macro side, areas likely to be included are: dynamic models of             
              international trade, dynamic models of monetary and fiscal policy,             
              models of aggregate growth and its determinants, models of the                 
              long-run distribution of income and wealth, models of fertility and            
              human capital accumulation, and computation of equilibria for                  
              dynamic models.  On the micro side, areas that look promising are:             
              the role of information in asset pricing, the economic implications            
              of evolutionary game theory, bounded rationality and learning, the             
              empirical implications of industrial organization models, and the              
              design of political institutions.
