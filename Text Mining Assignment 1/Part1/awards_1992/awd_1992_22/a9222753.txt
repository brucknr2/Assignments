Abstract    :
              The objective of this research is to carry further the work                    
              that has been previously accomplished in reducing bit                          
              balling, and to double the rate of penetration while drilling                  
              in shales by applying a negative potential of a few volts to                   
              the bit which causes the development of a lubricating water                    
              film at the bit-shale interface. Experiments so far have                       
              been carried out with roller-cone bits at small scale. In                      
              this work it will be determined if similar good results can                    
              be obtained at larger scale, with drag bits as well as with                    
              roller-cone bits, and in the presence of clay-containing                       
              drilling muds. The project will be supported by matching                       
              funds from industry.
