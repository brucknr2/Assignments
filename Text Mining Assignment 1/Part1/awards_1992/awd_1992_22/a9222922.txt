Abstract    :
                   A dexterous manipulator with seven degrees of freedom shall be            
              obtained for research projects involving mobile robots with high               
              degrees of freedom.  These projects include:                                   
                                                                                             
              *  Behavior-based control.                                                     
                                                                                             
              *  Impedance algorithms.                                                       
                                                                                             
              *  Error recovery                                                              
                                                                                             
              *  Parallel numerical algorithms for redundant robots.                         
                                                                                             
              *  Robust and fault-tolerant robotics visual tracking and servoing.
