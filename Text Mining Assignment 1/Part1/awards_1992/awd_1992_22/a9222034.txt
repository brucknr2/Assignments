Abstract    :
              Advances in the state-of-the-art of bridge design clearly                      
              indicate the need for generalized inelastic steel girder bridge                
              design procedures which include all possible girder cross-                     
              sectional shapes, both compact and noncompact.  This need is                   
              confirmed by the proposed AASHTO LRFD Bridge Design                            
              Specifications' encouragement to use inelastic design procedures.              
              The purpose of this research project is to fill in the knowledge               
              gaps pertaining to inelastic behavior of steel girder bridges by               
              establishing the inelastic load characteristics of noncompact                  
              steel sections typically used by the bridge industry and                       
              developing analytical and structural behavior models that                      
              accurately predict the performance of inelastically loaded                     
              structures.                                                                    
                                                                                             
              Three large-scale steel girders will be investigated for such                  
              phenomena as concrete deck cracking and concrete-steel slip,                   
              progressive yielding effects, and inelastic moment-rotation                    
              behavior of compact and noncompact composite girders.  The                     
              experimental results, in conjunction with other relevant                       
              information, will be used to develop comprehensive, practical                  
              inelastic design procedures for noncompact, composite and                      
              noncomposite girders, which are not presently covered by current               
              design provisions.//
