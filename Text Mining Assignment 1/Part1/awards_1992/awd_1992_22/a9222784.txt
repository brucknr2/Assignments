Abstract    :
                   This project "Pilot Projects in Simulation-Based Concurrent               
              Engineering of Military Vehicles and Space Flight Systems" augments            
              the research program of the University of Iowa's                               
              Industry/University Cooperative Research Center for Simulation and             
              Design Optimization of Mechanical Systems.  It has been approved by            
              the National Science Board (NSF-92-104).  Funding for various tasks            
              within the proposal originate from a variety of sources.                       
                   The Defense Modeling and Simulation Office or the Department              
              of Defense is providing $950,000 for one year to fund a portion of             
              task 3.4 in the proposal.                                                      
                   The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency of the                      
              Department of Defense is providing $938,000 for one year to fund a             
              portion of task 3.2 in the proposal.                                           
                   The U.S. Army Industrial Engineering Activity at Rock Island              
              Arsenal is providing $100,000 for one year for a membership and to             
              fund a portion of task 3.3.4 in the proposal.                                  
                   Goddard Space Flight Center of NASA is providing $70,000 for              
              one year to fund a portion of task 3.1.1 and another $86,000 for               
              one year to fund a portion of task 3.5.                                        
                   The U.S. Army Tank Command (TACOM) is providing $100,000 for              
              one year to fund a portion of task 3.1.1 in the proposal.                      
                   The Program Manager recommends the University of Iowa be                  
              awarded $2,244,000 for one year under a three-year continuing award            
              for $17,029,786.
