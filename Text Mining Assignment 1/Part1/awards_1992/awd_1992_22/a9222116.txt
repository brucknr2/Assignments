Abstract    :
              This is an award to support research on                                        
              predicting the motion of groundwater                                           
              contaminant plumes taking systematically into                                  
              account the variability and uncertainties                                      
              about the source of the contamination.  The                                    
              site characterization procedure may be used                                    
              to assess the extent and severity of                                           
              contamination before remediation begins and                                    
              to evaluate progress during remediation. The                                   
              procedure to be developed is based on                                          
              Bayesian estimation techniques that combine                                    
              field measurements with predictions from a                                     
              stochastic groundwater model that provides                                     
              estimates of the mean and variance of solute                                   
              concentration throughout a contaminated site                                   
              that are revised whenever new measurements of                                  
              hydraulic conductivity, pressure head and/or                                   
              contaminant concentration become available.                                    
                                                                                             
              This research is related to a project                                          
              previously supported under NSF Grant No.                                       
              85-14987.  It complements research the                                         
              investigator is conducting with support from                                   
              the National Institute of Environmental                                        
              Health Sciences on field studies to                                            
              characterize the role of sorption on removing                                  
              contaminants from groundwater.  Results of                                     
              this project are expected to be used to                                        
              improve the engineering design and operation                                   
              of systems to decontaminate groundwater                                        
              aquifers.
