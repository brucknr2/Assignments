Abstract    :
                   A tightly coupled workstation cluster shall be developed as a             
              powerful and cost effective environment in which to conduct                    
              research on:                                                                   
                                                                                             
              *  Fast algorithms for equilibrium and diffusion problems.                     
                                                                                             
              *  Numerical methods for flows with multi-scale structure.                     
                                                                                             
              *  Direct and inverse problems in wave scattering from random                  
                 media.                                                                      
                                                                                             
              *  Fluid interface dynamics using parallelizable schemes.                      
                                                                                             
              *  Simulation of realistic neural networks.                                    
                                                                                             
              Algorithms shall be ported to or developed on the cluster and their            
              performance in this environment will be examined.
