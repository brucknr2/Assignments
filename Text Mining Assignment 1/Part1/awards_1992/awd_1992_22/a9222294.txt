                                         ABSTRACT                                            
                                                                                            
              Five structural linguistic features give strong promise of being               
              useful as genetic markers, i.e. of having sufficient diachronic                
              stability, resistance to borrowing, and independence from other                
              structural properties that they can point to deeper genetic                    
              relatedness between families of the greatest age now reachable by              
              the standard comparative method. All five are abstract properties              
              of the verbal lexicon, realized in verbal derivations, verbal                  
              inflection, and text frequencies of valence patterns and                       
              derivational types. This project will trace the five features                  
              through 120 or more languages (using a pre-existent worldwide                  
              sample, genetically based at a controlled time depth) and survey               
              a dozen language families and three high-diversity language areas              
              in much more depth. This data base will suffice to establish the               
              degree of variation of these features within language families,                
              the extent of borrowing between families in contact situations,                
              and any statistically significantly correlations between these                 
              features and standard typologically relevant features (already                 
              surveyed in previous work). The anticipated result will be a                   
              demonstration that these features are useful genetic markers,                  
              demonstration of their structural independence from other                      
              features and of their usefulness in typology, and concrete                     
              hypotheses of deeper genetic relatedness between certain language              
              families, chiefly of northern Eurasia.
