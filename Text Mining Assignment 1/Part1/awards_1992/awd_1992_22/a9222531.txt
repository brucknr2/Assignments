Abstract    :
              Resistance to Pseudomonas syringae pv.tomato(Pst) in tomato is                 
              conferred by a single dominant locus, Pto. Tools necessary for                 
              cloning the locus were developed during the tenure of the Plant                
              Postdoctoral Fellowship Award.  Near Isogenic lines of tomato were             
              used to identify RFLP and RAPD markers tightly linked to the gene              
              and a large F2 population was used to create a high resolution                 
              linkage map that allowed precise placement of Pto in relation to               
              the molecular markers. A tomato YAC library was constructed and a              
              screen identified a candidate for the Pto locus. The project will              
              be continued and the putative Pto gene isolated and characterized.

              This work should significantly increase our understanding and                  
              ability to control disease in plants.
