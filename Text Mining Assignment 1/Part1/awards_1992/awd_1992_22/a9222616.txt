Abstract    :
              Professor Kenneth Showalter is supported by a grant from the                   
              Theoretical and Computational Chemistry Program to continue his                
              studies on nonlinear dynamics in chemical systems.  Research                   
              will be conducted in three specific areas: 1) he will develop                  
              and characterize new chemical wave behavior in open and closed                 
              chemical systems; 2) he will develop feedback methods which are                
              capable of controlling chaos in chemical systems; and 3) he                    
              will study chemical waves on membranes in capillary tubes.  The                
              work will incorporate both experimental and theoretical studies.               
              %%%                                                                            
              Nonlinear dynamics has blossomed in the past decade to become                  
              what many regard as a genuine scientific revolution, and it is                 
              now recognized throughout the natural sciences as a powerful                   
              tool for understanding complexity in nature.  Chemical systems                 
              have played an important role in advancing the field because                   
              they are especially amenable to experimental and theoretical                   
              analysis, and hence serve as ideal models of more complex                      
              biological systems.  With this grant Showalter will pursue                     
              experimental and theoretical studies to develop a better                       
              understanding of dynamical complexity of chemical systems.
