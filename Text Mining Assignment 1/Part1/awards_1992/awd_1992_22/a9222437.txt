Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This award provides support for a long-term visit to Japan for                 
              Professor Robert Latorre, Professor and Chairman, Department of                
              Naval Architecture and Marine Engineering, University of New                   
              Orleans, who will work with Professor Hideaki Miyata, Department               
              of Naval Architecture and Ocean Engineering, University of Tokyo,              
              from January to June 1993.  The project involves computer                      
              modeling of the free surface flow around a flat or blunt bow                   
              typical of barges, towboats, and workboats used in the Gulf of                 
              Mexico.  The numerical calculations will be made by using the                  
              Tokyo University Modified Marker and Cell program, TUMMAC.  This               
              program has been used to study a number of free surface flows                  
              caused by slender and moderately full hull forms, as well as                   
              breaking waves.                                                                
                                                                                             
              The research project will contribute to the advancement of                     
              technology in the area of ship design and ocean engineering.  The              
              unique problem is the inclusion of the free-surface in the fluid               
              dynamics equations.  Although it may be awhile before                          
              shipbuilding is restored to its previous level of activity, it                 
              may not be so long before ship design using computer aided                     
              virtual simulations is internationally centered in the United                  
              States.  The integration of codes such as TUMMAC into the design               
              procedure is important in this development.  The project will                  
              also result in enhanced engineering education through computer                 
              and video instructional materials.
