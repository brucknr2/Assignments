Abstract    :
                   This is a project in medium-energy nuclear theory at the                  
              University of Pittsburgh.  Studies of antinucleon-nucleon and                  
              meson electroproduction reactions, the effects of                              
              intermediate-state resonances, isobar excitation and short-                    
              range quark interactions using the momentum-space approach                     
              developed by the principal investigator will be pursued.  Spin                 
              observables play a fundamental part in studying these effects.                 
                   In electroproduction, investigations of K+                                
              photoproduction as a source of new information about the                       
              formation of N* resonances will be carried out.  Our coupled-                  
              channels antinucleon code will be adapted to photoproduction                   
              processes and used to study reactions that relate to possible                  
              work at CEBAF.  The effect of multistep reactions will be                      
              studied.  Particular attention will be paid to the resulting                   
              spin observables.
