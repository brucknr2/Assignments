Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The coordination of complex integrated movements is one of the                 
              most challenging tasks that faces the nervous system.  An                      
              experimental approach that has proved very fruitful is the study               
              of simple model systems.  Crayfish have nervous systems where it               
              is possible to identify a limited number of neurons that control               
              swimming behavior.  Dr. Mulloney has been a pioneer in the study               
              of this nervous system.  With NSF support he has found that the                
              movement of each separate limb is driven by a specialized local                
              circuit of neurons specific for that limb.  Coordination of limb               
              movements is controlled by a separate circuit of interneurons.                 
              This is a major advance in our understanding of movement control.              
              With the renewal of this grant, Dr. Mulloney will be able to                   
              describe the synaptic organization of these local circuits and                 
              identify the properties necessary for normal coordination.  He                 
              will also describe the cellular mechanisms by which inputs                     
              descending from higher centers can change the state of these                   
              local circuits to modulate swimming rate and direction.  The                   
              results will have broad applications in the design of robot                    
              locomotion systems.  The type of distributed control identified                
              in this system is emerging as a general principle for the                      
              guidance of locomotion in multi-appendage systems.***//
