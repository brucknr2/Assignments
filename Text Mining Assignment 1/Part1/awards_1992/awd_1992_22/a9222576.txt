Abstract    :
                   Convective storms are of fundamental interest to scientists as            
              well as important to the general public.  Such storms produce                  
              severe weather that is economically disruptive and life-threatening            
              as well as producing beneficial rainfall.  Accurate short term                 
              predictions (up to 24 hours) of the location, timing, intensity and            
              type of convective storm would be of substantial benefit to                    
              society.                                                                       
                   Using the Advanced Regional Prediction System numerical model             
              developed at a NSF Science and Technology Center, Center for                   
              Analysis and Prediction of Storms, the Principal Investigator will             
              attack various aspects of prediction of convective activity.  By               
              using broader parameter spaces as well as higher spatial                       
              resolution, more realistic methods for inserting                               
              pseudo-observational errors into the simulations during storm                  
              evolution, and a more accurate method for treating subgrid-scale               
              motions, the Principal Investigator will evaluate the utility of               
              various dynamical parameters in predicting storm behavior within a             
              variety of environmental settings; examine linkages between                    
              helicity and energy dissipation; and attempt to understand how                 
              errors grow and propagate in convective storms so as to establish              
              predictability limits as a function of storm type, environment and             
              other parameters.
