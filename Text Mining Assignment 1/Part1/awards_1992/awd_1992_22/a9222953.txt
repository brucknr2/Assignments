Abstract    :
              The purpose of this research is to develop and evaluate                        
              alternative theories of alliance behavior, and to apply the                    
              theory of alliances and spillovers to the study of global                      
              collective action, including treaty formulation and adherence.                 
              In particular, the noncooperative behavior among nations                       
              confronted with common pollution problems is analyzed.  Various                
              strategic behavioral alternatives and their impact on resource                 
              allocation are examined.  In addition, institutional arrangements              
              to elicit cooperation are examined, while accounting for                       
              transaction costs of a fixed and variable nature.  Alliance                    
              models will be applied to analyze the determinants of                          
              participation in the 1987 Montreal Protocol on CFC emission                    
              reductions.  Further, the degree to which cooperative behavior                 
              was practiced by the signatories' actions after the agreement                  
              will also be studied.  This research on cooperative behavior for               
              mitigating pollution is extremely important and timely given the               
              heightened concern about attaining better global cooperation for               
              reducing atmospheric pollution and the possibility for                         
              catastrophic global warming.
