Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The goal of this project is to understand how developing nerve                 
              cells make connections with muscles, and to determine how those                
              connections alter their properties as a function of activity.                  
              There is evidence that developing nerve connections are refined                
              during development by activity mediated mechanisms.  The influence             
              of activity on changes in nerve ending size and projection patterns            
              will be examined by use of mutations that disrupt the ability of               
              neurons and muscles to generate normal electrical activity.  These             
              changes will also be investigated by the use of toxins that                    
              specifically interfere with nerve and muscle electrical activity.              
              To observe the development of the nerve muscle connections, and                
              their responses to experimental manipulations, time-lapse video                
              movies will be made of the living nerve endings maintained in semi-            
              intact cultures.  These experiments will elucidate several                     
              fundamental features of normal nervous system development.
