Abstract    :
              9222916  Goochee  This project is on research to investigate the  activities of
              sialidases in Chinese Hamster  Ovary (CHO) cell cultures relative to possible 
              extracellular modification of sugar groups on  secreted glycoprotiens expressed
              during the  culturing process.  Glycopropteins have many  important
              pharmaceutical applications, for  example, for the clinical treatment of
              chronic  renal failure, cancer, heart disease,  enzymatic deficiencies, blood
              clotting  diseases, and cystic fibrosis.  The presence  or absence of sialic
              acid in glycoprotein  oligosaccharides strongly affects properties  such as
              solubility, specific activity, and  circulatory half - life in vivo.  This
              project  contains a program to determine the bioprocess  conditions that
              minimize or maximize the  enzymatic hydrolysis of sialic acid from 
              glycoprotein oligosaccharides.  The properties  of sialidases from several
              other important  mammalian cell lines will also be explored.
