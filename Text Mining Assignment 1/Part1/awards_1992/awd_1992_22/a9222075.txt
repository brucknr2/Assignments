Abstract    :
              9222075  Gonzalez-Lima    Brain metabolic mapping techniques have the potential
              of providing  information about functional interactions within entire neural 
              systems.  Large quantities of data can be obtained from mapping  studies, but
              an analytic technique to make sense of the complex  network interactions that
              take place in the brain has not been  available.  Structural modeling may
              provide such a technique by  combining the anatomical connectivity with the
              covariation in the  activity between brain regions.  Functional strengths of
              anatomical  connections between the structures that form a neural system could 
              be quantified by assigning numerical values to the links.  Changes  in these
              values could be used as indices of how information is  processed and modified
              within the brain in a given situation.  The  purpose of this proposal is to use
              existing metabolic data from  auditory learning experiments to develop
              structural models of  auditory and nonauditory systems.  The proposed methods
              will also  be evaluated using simulated data with known relationships.***
