Abstract    :
                   The research, in the general area of theoretical                          
              elementary particle physics, will concentrate on aspects of                    
              two-dimensional quantum field theory which are important in                    
              the solution of mathematical problems that arise in the                        
              understanding of superstring theory and statistical systems.                   
              (Super)string theory, which is believed to provide the basic                   
              understanding of the fundamental forces of nature, has as its                  
              underlying mathematical and quantum-mechanical description the                 
              formalism and methods of two-dimensional quantum field theory.                 
              The same formalism and methods are used in the study of                        
              certain one- and two-dimensional statistical mechanics models                  
              which describe the behavior of diverse systems such as long-                   
              chain molecules and membranes, and may explain certain                         
              phenomena such as high temperature superconductivity.  In both                 
              cases it has become apparent that much progress can be made in                 
              those situations where one is dealing with "integrable"                        
              systems, because in such situations a complete solution of the                 
              corresponding mathematical problems can be obtained.  It is                    
              believe that the relevant integrable systems can be described                  
              in two complementary, but equivalent, manners, either as so-                   
              called Liouville and Toda theories, or as nonlocal induced                     
              gravity and W-gravity theories.  The research will focus on                    
              the study of such theories and is expected to provide                          
              important information concerning strings and the explanation                   
              of the fundamental forces of nature, as well as information                    
              about statistical systems which arise in many practical                        
              applications.
