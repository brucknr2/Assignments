Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This proposal is the U.S. side of a U.S.-Russia Cooperative                    
              proposal simultaneously submitted together with Dr. Pavel Balaban              
              of the Institute of Higher Nervous Activity and Neurophysiology                
              in Moscow.  The proposal is directed at several questions about                
              the organization of a serotonergic neuromodulatory system in the               
              gastropod mollusc, Helix aspersa.  These questions have recently               
              become approachable with the advent of voltage-sensitive dye                   
              recording methods that can simultaneously monitor the action                   
              potential activity of several hundred neurons in these ganglia.                
              In this first grant period we hope to answer the following:  How               
              uniform is the group of serotonergic neurons in their response to              
              touch and to noxious stimuli?  How much synaptic interconnection               
              is there among these serotonergic cells?  Is the response of                   
              these cells sensitive to the satiation state of the animal?  Are               
              there fundamental differences from animal-to-animal in the                     
              functioning of the modulatory neurons?  How does the function of               
              this group change during habitualtion and sensitization?  The                  
              answers to these questions would provide specific information                  
              about neuromodulation  in the Helix nervous system but will also               
              be more general significance.  These experiments will be the                   
              first attempt to obtain physiological data on the functional                   
              cohesiveness of a group of apparently similar neruons.  Further,               
              some of the results from Helix will test the generality of                     
              conclusions about consistency in nervous systems obtained from                 
              experiments on the Aplysia abdominal ganglion.***//
