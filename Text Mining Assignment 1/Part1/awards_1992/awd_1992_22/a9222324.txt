Abstract    :
              9222324  KORNBLUM    These studies are part of a broad, ongoing research program
              on the  basic, elemental, cognitive processes involved in the performance  of
              simple and complex tasks.  In this research, the focus will be  on a family of
              eight classic experimental paradigms in cognitive  psychology.   According to
              the taxonomy derived from Kornblum's  recently published model, the dimensional
              overlap model, these  paradigms are all variants of either stimulus-stimulus
              and/or  stimulus-response compatibility.  Fundamental problems come to  light
              in the course of attempting to identify the processing  mechanisms that mediate
              the facilitation and interference effects  observed in performance with those
              tasks.  According to the model,   these effects are consequences of the
              dimensional overlap (i.e.,  the similarity) between the sets of stimuli and
              responses, and/or  the relevant and irrelevant aspects of these tasks.  The 
              experiments will test specific predictions of the model.  In  particular, the
              first experiment will test the model's predictions  concerning the effects of
              irrelevant dimensions in four related  paradigmatic tasks, while the second
              experiment will seek to  identify the limits within which the model applies in
              single  response tasks.  The results will not only contribute to our 
              understanding of the cognitive and attentional processes involved  in
              performance, but will enable us to assess the consequences of  varying work
              load in these and other similar tasks.    ***
