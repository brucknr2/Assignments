Abstract    :
                   This award supports the U.S. participation in a workshop to be            
              held in Taipei/China to explore research on climate changes of the             
              last 2000 years in monsoon Asia.  The discussion focuses on the                
              preparation and analysis of:  (1) early instrumental and historical            
              records (colonial and indigenous) and (2) high resolution proxy                
              records of past climate, such as tree rings, laminated sediments,              
              banded corals, ice cores from high alpine areas.  The National                 
              Research council of Taipei/China has agreed to host the meeting                
              under the auspices of the IGBP-Past Global Changes (PAGES).
