Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This proposal seeks to explain movements of the body of the leech,             
              Hirudo medicinalis, in terms of the forces generated by its muscles            
              and by the arrangement of these muscles in the body wall.  In                  
              addition to moving the animal, these muscles also produce a stiff              
              tube which constitutes a "hydrostatic skeleton".  There is no                  
              general theory for such a skeleton that would allow us to predict              
              the shape of the animal's body from the activity pattern of its                
              motor neurons.  Therefore, the goal of this proposal is to use a               
              combination of experimental measurements and numerical simulations             
              to derive a quantitative description of hydrostatic skeletons in               
              general and of the leech in particular.  This study will proceed in            
              three steps:                                                                   
              1.  Describing leech movements in biomechanical terms.  Segmental              
              volumes, muscular tensions, geometric relationships of the muscles,            
              internal pressures, and fluid flows will be determined.                        
                                                                                             
              2. Developing an analytical model of hydrodynamic skeletons.  The              
              current best model will be expanded to produce more realistic body             
              forms, using the physical measurements obtained above.                         
                                                                                             
              3.  Refining the model by comparing its performance to behaviors.              
              Measurements during the production of simpler behaviors (bending               
              and shortening) will be used to determine parameters which will                
              tested by the model's ability to produce the more global behaviors             
              (swimming and shortening).  Such a model should be applicable to               
              other hydroskeletons as well.***
