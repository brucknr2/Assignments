Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              One of the most significant advances in our understanding                      
              of development of the brain during the past two decades                        
              is the realization that nerve connections made during                          
              embryonic life undergo substantial rearrangement as the                        
              nervous system matures.  Some connections are eliminated,                      
              while others become strengthened and stabilized.                               
              Evidence suggests that this rearrangement results from a                       
              competitive interaction between adjacent nerve                                 
              connections in a manner that depends upon the pattern of                       
              nerve activity, which is in turn triggered by the sensory                      
              input from the environment.  This activity-dependent                           
              competition between adjacent connections has been                              
              observed in both central and peripheral nervous systems,                       
              but the mechanism responsible for this phenomenon is                           
              poorly understood.  In the previous granting period of                         
              this project, it was discovered that activity-dependent                        
              competition can be observed in isolated synaptic                               
              connections in a simple cell culture.  This finding opens                      
              the possibility of experimentally addressing the problem                       
              of synaptic competition effectively at cellular and                            
              molecular levels.  In the present project, a series of                         
              experiments will be carried out that will result in an                         
              insight into the mechanism responsible for modulating the                      
              strength of synaptic connections.  This should lead to an                      
              understanding of how adjacent synapses on a single                             
              postsynaptic cell compete for survival and of the                              
              physiological and morphological changes at the synapse                         
              during the process of synaptic competition.  The results                       
              from these studies will help us to understand how nerve                        
              connections are modified during development of the                             
              nervous system.
