Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The brain is especially vulnerable to damage in the neonatal and               
              early fetal period.  Early brain damage can lead to a bewildering              
              variety of behavioral problems.  Damage early in development does              
              not necessarily cause the same effects as damage in adulthood.  Dr.            
              Berger Sweeney has developed a novel model system for studying the             
              effects of early brain damage.  She has found that lesions of an               
              important nucleus in the forebrain the nucleus basalis of Meynert              
              (nBM) cause unusual cellular formations in the sensori motor cortex            
              in adulthood and have severe deficits in spatial navigation.  She              
              hypothesizes that the behavioral and morphological effects are due             
              to transient depletion of cholinergic afferents to the cortex.  She            
              will now determine whether the affected behaviors are ones known to            
              be dependent on cholinergic function or whether the deficits are               
              due to some more nonspecific effect of the early lesion.  She will             
              also attempt to reverse the effects of the early lesions by                    
              augmenting the function of the depleted transmitter.  The results              
              will greatly strengthen our understanding of the mechanisms by                 
              which early brain damage affects behavior and may set the stage for            
              developing effective therapies.***//
