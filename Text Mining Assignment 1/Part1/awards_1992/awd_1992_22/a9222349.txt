Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Dopamine is one of the most important transmitters in the brain.               
              Too little dopamine leads to Parkinson's disease.  Too much is                 
              associated with dysfunctional stereotyped behavior.  This                      
              transmitter is also crucially involved in reinforcement and                    
              reward.  During his previous NSF grant, Dr. Wightman has                       
              perfected a technique for monitoring the temporal course of                    
              dopamine release with high spatial resolution in awake behaving                
              animals.  The technique, called in vivo voltammetry, utilizes                  
              highly sensitive carbon fiber electrodes that register voltage                 
              changes when dopamine is released.  Using this technique he will               
              now determine whether the different behavioral effects of                      
              dopamine on motor and reward systems are associated with                       
              different patterns of release and uptake by neurons in the brain               
              systems that are associated with motor behavior and reward.  The               
              results will have wide implications for theories of how the brain              
              coordinates behavior and mediates reward.  This project is an                  
              example of how new technology makes it possible to answer old                  
              questions.***//
