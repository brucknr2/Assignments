Abstract    :
              The study of the diffusion of molecular and atomic species on                  
              metal surfaces is the subject of this research project,                        
              supported in the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program.  A                  
              field emission fluctuation technique will be used to study in                  
              detail the diffusion of hydrogen, deuterium, carbon monoxide                   
              and oxygen on various planes of platinum, iridium, and rhodium.                
              Digital data acquisition and analysis methods will be perfected                
              and utilized in these studies, which build on previous                         
              investigations of diffusion on  refractory metal field emission                
              tips.  Simulation studies of these diffusion systems will also                 
              be carried out, providing a more complete mechanistic                          
              understanding of the diffusion process.

              A detailed understanding of diffusion on solid surfaces is                     
              crucial to an understanding of such important technological                    
              processes as catalysis and thin film growth.  Obtaining                        
              detailed experimental information about diffusion is very                      
              difficult, however.  The goal of this research project is to                   
              continue to develop and apply a unique method for obtaining                    
              this information on several very well characterized solid                      
              surface diffusion systems.  This work will enhance our                         
              understanding of the basic physical processes of surface                       
              diffusion.
