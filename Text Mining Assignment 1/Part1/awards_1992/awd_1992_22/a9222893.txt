Abstract    :
                   Equipment for constructing a computer-based facility capable              
              of processing video sequences and 3D and 4D images including two               
              Sparc 10 computers capable of 24 bit color display will be                     
              interfaced with Parallax video boards and other video equipment for            
              control of frame-by-frame processing and recording shall be                    
              acquired.  The resulting facility will make possible advanced                  
              education and research in video sequence processing, image sequence            
              filtering, image sequence segmenting, visualization and analysis of            
              heart motion, and 3D and 4D ultrasound images for medical                      
              diagnosis.
