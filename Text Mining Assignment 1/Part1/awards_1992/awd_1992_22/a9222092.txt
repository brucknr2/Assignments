Abstract    :
              This award supports an in situ and short traverse seismic                      
              reflection/refraction and magnetotelluric experiment in West                   
              Antarctica.  This collaborative experiment involves four awards at             
              four institutions.  The four-fold purpose is 1) to investigate part            
              of the Byrd Subglacial Basin, 2) to test techniques for this work              
              that could be done in a long traverse, 3) to determine the                     
              viability of the magnetotelluric method on a thick (electrically               
              resistive) ice sheet, and 4) to evaluate the relative merits of                
              refraction with wide reflection versus reflection with narrow                  
              refraction seismic studies in imaging the lithosphere.  The                    
              geophysical techniques that will be employed are capable of imaging            
              the ice sheet, the continental lithosphere, and the upper mantle,              
              as well as determining physical properties of parts of the                     
              lithosphere and mantle.  Investigations of outcrop geology over the            
              last thirty years in West Antarctica and the Transantarctic                    
              Mountains have lead to recent interpretations that the crust is                
              made up of many different lithospheric blocks.  Seismic reflection             
              work is the only way image the crust in detail and the refraction              
              work is the only way to determine physical properties of the layers            
              and blocks defined by the reflection work.  The magnetotelluric                
              work is scientifically risky because it may not yield useful                   
              information when used over the electrically resistive ice sheet.               
              However, if it works it has the potential to image molten rock in              
              the crust and upper mantle.  In a continental rift region such as              
              West Antarctica, the presence of melt in the lithosphere is likely             
              and, if documented, has very important ramifications to ice sheet              
              dynamics.  Research work supported by this award is expected to                
              provide constraints to models of a range of crustal processes from             
              models of ice sheet dynamics to tectonic and kinematic models of               
              lithospheric thinning and rifting.
