Abstract    :
                   The objective of this workshop is to identify critical product            
              life cycle issues in biomedical engineering design.  The                       
              participants include representatives from academia, industry,                  
              consulting organizations and providers of health care delivery.                
              Special efforts have been made to engage users, be they consumers,             
              professionals or physicians.                                                   
                   The workshop addresses the challenges created by the impact               
              of devices and materials on living systems in the engineering                  
              design process.  The effective transfer of general design theory               
              and methodology concepts to the domain of biomedical engineering               
              is another motivation for this activity.  The ultimate goal is the             
              development of a research agenda that will more fully incorporate              
              issues of safety, process control and efficacy assessment in the               
              life cycle design, manufacturing and deployment of biomedical                  
              engineering products.
