Abstract    :
                   The proposal focuses on the subject of electron                           
              correlations in simple two electron systems.  Computations of                  
              energy and angular distributions produced by charged particle                  
              and photon impact are undertaken in the region where three                     
              coulomb particles are free.  This problem still remains as one                 
              of the most difficult challenges of modern atomic physics,                     
              especially at low impact energies.
