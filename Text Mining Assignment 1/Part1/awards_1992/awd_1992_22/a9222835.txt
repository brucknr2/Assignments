Abstract    :
              Professor Paul Rabinow is undertaking a Professional Development               
              Fellowship at the Centre d'Etude du Polymorphisme Humain (CEPH) in Paris       
              receiving training in the innovative techniques of Yeast Artificial            
              Cloning and DNA typing.  He is undertaking this training in                    
              biological methods in order to enable him to study CEPH and two                
              related institutions: Genethon, a high-tech facility organized to              
              rapidly identify disease genes and the Association Francaise Contre les        
              Myophathies (AFM),  a `disease-group' concerned with the myopathies.           
              Taken together, the CEPH-Genethon-AFM embody a distinctive form of             
              doing science, one which links science, society and technology from            
              the start.  Given that the CEPH has been more than competitive in              
              its scientific and technical output, its success poses the question            
              about what the connection might be between its commitment to                   
              integrating social concerns with cutting edge technology and                   
              scientific advance.  This institutional complex works and it is                
              essential for science policy studies to find out why.  Professor               
              Rabinow's training and research are designed to address the issue              
              using anthropological and historical methods.
