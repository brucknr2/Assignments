Abstract    :
              The focus of this research is the use of ligands to control                    
              catalyst homogeneity and miscibility.  First, polymeric ligands                
              will be prepared that have inverse temperature dependent                       
              solubility.  The goal is to use a macromolecular ligand to both                
              ligate a metal and to regulate a reaction.  Second, oligomeric                 
              ligands will be designed to provide or contribute to the                       
              solvent microenvironment around a catalyst so that the effects                 
              of bulk solvent are mitigated.  Third, macromolecules will be                  
              studied for the ability to phase isolate soluble species from                  
              one another in a common solvent.  Finally, chiral                              
              macromolecular ligands that enhance stereoselectivity will be                  
              studied.

              With this award, the Synthetic Organic Program is supporting                   
              the research of Dr. David E. Bergbreiter of the Department of                  
              Chemistry at Texas A&M University.  Professor Bergbreiter will                 
              focus his work on using the properties of soluble                              
              macromolecules to design ligands that control the physical                     
              properties of homogeneous catalysts.  The general idea is to                   
              learn if the physiochemical properties of soluble polymers can                 
              control a homogeneous catalyst's homogeneity and miscibility in                
              useful ways.
