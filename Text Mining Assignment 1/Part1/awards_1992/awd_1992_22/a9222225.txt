Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                Aquatic organisms often find their prey by recognizing and                  
              following chemical cues dissolved in the water.  This work will                
              determine the identity and physical transport of odorant molecules             
              governing olfactory-mediated predation by the blue crab.                       
              Biochemical techniques will be used to characterize the chemical               
              attractant molecules, electrochemical instrumentation will be used             
              to investigate the nature of the odor "plume" structure, and a                 
              flume apparatus will be used to link hydrodynamic processes and                
              boundary layer considerations to odor plume structure and predatory            
              success.  The results will be important to sensory neurobiology, to            
              field ecology on this important estuarine predator, to biological              
              oceanographic considerations of hydrodynamics and ecology, and are             
              likely to have an impact on developing aquaculture of this major               
              commercial species.
