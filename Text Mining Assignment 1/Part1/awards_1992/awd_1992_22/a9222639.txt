Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  This is a study of social threat and social control, examining            
              the effects of threats such as crime and economic problems on the              
              growth or decline of bureaucracies whose public mission is to deal             
              with them.  The investigator will assemble a data set with city as             
              the unit of analysis, drawing upon official statistics over the                
              span 1960-1990, to allow him to test theoretical propositions drawn            
              from conflict theory.  Three kinds of threat will be studied                   
              (criminal, racial, economic), along with several measures of the               
              activity of control bureaucracies (police size, imprisonment rates,            
              mental hospital admissions, welfare payments).                                 
                                                                                             
                   This project will integrate several fields and contribute to              
              criminology, race relations, economics of social problems, and                 
              policy studies.  It will increase our understanding of the                     
              processes of social conflict that shape public institutions and                
              their response to perceived threats.
