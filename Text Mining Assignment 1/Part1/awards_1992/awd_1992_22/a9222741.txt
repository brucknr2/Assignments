Abstract    :
              9222741  Kostic  The objective of this research is to understand the mechanism
              of  electron transfer in electrostatic (noncovalent) protein/protein 
              complexes.  The molecular basis for the optimal reaction rate and  specificity
              will be studied with the fully-characterized  metalloproteins cytochrome c
              (cyt) and plastocyanin (pc).   Building upon this laboratory's recent
              successes, a detailed plan  is proposed that combines molecular biology
              (mutation of pc),  computational chemistry (analysis of electron-transfer
              paths),  and kinetics (laser flash photolysis) in order to achieve the 
              following:  (1) determine reactive orientations of cyt/pc  complexes; (2)
              pinpoint dominant transfer paths from the heme to  the Cu site; (3) examine how
              variations in distant electronic  couplings controls the rate of electron
              transfer; (4) determine  the rate of structural rearrangement of cyt/pc
              complexes and  establish kinetic requirements for "gating"; and (5) explore the
               importance for electron transfer of conformational fluctuations  at the
              protein/protein interface.  %%%  This research is important because
              electron-transfer reactions of  metalloproteins are essential to various
              biological processes.   These reactions are involved in animal metabolism and
              plant  photosynthesis.  A deeper understanding of electron transfer, at  the
              molecular level, is necessary for a better understanding of  the origin and
              transformations of chemical energy in a living  cell.  ***
