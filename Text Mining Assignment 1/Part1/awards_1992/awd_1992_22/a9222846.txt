Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The Keystone Conference on "Evolution and Plant Development" will              
              be held at Taos, New Mexico, January 26 through February 1, 1993.              
              %%%                                                                            
              This is the first such conference specifically organized around the            
              evolution of plant development and thus brings together plant                  
              biologist who would not normally be present at the same meeting.               
              Particularly, younger scientists who will be encouraged to attend,             
              should benefit greatly from such interaction.
