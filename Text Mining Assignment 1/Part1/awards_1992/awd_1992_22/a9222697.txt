Abstract    :
              The focus of this research is the development of two methods                   
              for the preparation of equatorial glycosidic linkages with an                  
              emphasis on 1,2-cis-equatorial and 2-deoxy-equatorial linkages.                
              Both approaches, one involving free radical, intramolecular                    
              hydrogen abstraction and the other involving copper ion                        
              promoted substitution of picolinate glycosyl esters, rely on                   
              inversion at the anomeric center of a readily prepared axial                   
              isomer.

              With this award, the Synthetic Organic Program is supporting                   
              the research of Dr. David Crich of the Department of Chemistry                 
              at the University of Ilinois at Chicago.  Professor Crich will                 
              focus his work on the synthesis of the oligosaccharide portion                 
              of glycoproteins.  These proteins are implicated in processes                  
              ranging from the binding and transport of enzymes, hormones,                   
              antibodies and lectins through cell-cell recognition.
