Abstract    :
                   Professor Boshier will make precision measurements of the                 
              spectrum of the hydrogen atom using high resolution Doppler-free               
              two-photon spectroscopy.  These measurements will be among the                 
              most accurate determinations of the ground state Lamb shift in                 
              hydrogen which, in turn, will be an extremely rigorous test of                 
              quantum electrodynamics (QED).  A second experiment comparing two              
              transitions in the optical spectrum of the He+ ion will be even                
              more sensitive tests of the theory, which will be limited by                   
              uncertainty in the size of the proton radius.
