Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              We plan studies of the cell biological basis of learning and memory            
              in Octopus vulgaris.  Octopus with 108 nerve cells has a highly                
              developed brain.  It is able to learn to learn to discriminate                 
              shapes visually and textures by touch.  We believe that learning is            
              accompanied by growth cone activity as in developing brains                    
              reawakened on a limited scale as learning occurs.  As essential                
              feature of growth cones is the extension of finger-like processes              
              <0.5 um in diameter (filopodia) that can develop into new synapses.            
              Their growth depends on actin polymerization.  We have shown by                
              electron microscopy (EM) that filopodia are present in learning                
              neuropils in octopus and increase with touch learning and that                 
              cytochalasin D, which blocks actin polymerization blocks touch                 
              learning with a decrease in filopodial numbers.  We have shown by              
              electron microscopy (EM) that filopodia are present in learning                
              neuropils in octopus and increase with touch learning with a                   
              decrease in filopodial numbers.  Conversely nerve growth factor                
              facilitates touch learning.  We have found a protein in octopus                
              brain, like one in Helisoma, antibodies to it to see if it blocks              
              touch learning and causes decreased filopodial counts.  NO synthase            
              inhibitors block LTP in rat hippocampus and we have evidence that              
              they block touch learning in octopus, which we will pursue.***//
