Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Molten polychalcogenide salt and hydrothermal techniques will be               
              used to explore the synthesis of new chalcogenide materials at low             
              and intermediate temperatures.  Both synthetic techniques will use             
              various A2Qx salts in reactions with late transition metals and                
              main-group elements.  Reactions at temperatures between 200-500 oC             
              will be studied because this range has been little explored                    
              previously.  It has been demonstrated that in this temperature                 
              range new materials with new structure types can form and                      
              crystallize.  The remarkable ability of sulfur, selenium, and                  
              tellurium to bridge different sub-structures in two and three                  
              dimensions, and the relatively low temperatures provide a lucrative            
              opportunity for synthesis of a very large number of new compounds.             
              Physical properties of these new compounds to be explored include              
              magnetic, sorption as a function of temperature, and redox                     
              properties.  In order to probe unusual electronic phenomena, the               
              charge transport properties of the new compounds will be studied in            
              detail via variable temperature four-probe resistivity as well as              
              thermoelectric power (Seebeck) measurements.  The measurements will            
              be primarily done on single crystal samples.                                   
                                                                                             
              This grant is jointly supported by the Division of Materials                   
              Research, and the Chemistry Division.
