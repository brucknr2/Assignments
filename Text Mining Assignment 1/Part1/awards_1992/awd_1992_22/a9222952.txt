Abstract    :
                   This group studies gravity physics via experimental and                   
              theoretical work on extragalactic astronomy and cosmology.                     
                   The COBE detection of anisotropy of the 2.7K thermal                      
              cosmic background radiation (the CBR) shows the fluctuations                   
              are large enough to be studied from the ground and balloons.                   
              It seems likely that the character of the anisotropy on                        
              angular scales from 30 arc min to the COBE resolution at about                 
              10 will be a strong discriminant for theories of the nature                   
              and origin of structure.  Work will continue on the                            
              development of techniques to map the CBR and the analysis of                   
              theories of the origin of the angular fluctuations.                            
                   The long wavelength part of the CBR spectrum is important                 
              as a constraint on the evolution of the intergalactic medium,                  
              but the spectrum is not well measured.  Research will continue                 
              on a systematic approach to deal with the main experimental                    
              problem, the separation of the CBR from the emission from our                  
              galaxy.                                                                        
                   A believable theory of galaxy formation must account for                  
              the properties of the CBR, the observations of galaxies and                    
              the intergalactic medium at redshifts greater than unity, and                  
              the systematics of the distribution and motions of galaxies at                 
              relatively low redshifts.  Research will continue on the                       
              development of the theoretical and numerical techniques needed                 
              to interpret these phenomena and use them as tests for the                     
              models for the development of structure in an expanding                        
              universe.
