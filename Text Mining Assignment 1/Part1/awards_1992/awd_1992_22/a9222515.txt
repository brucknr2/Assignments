Abstract    :
              The purpose of the research to be performed under this SGER award              
              is to verify experimentally that interface coatings of optimum                 
              stiffness applied to reinforcing fibers can significantly improve              
              the performance of composites by reducing, or eliminating, cross-              
              ply cracking.  New detailed information on the interaction                     
              between a fiber, the matrix and the interphase regions of                      
              composites will be generated.  This will provide a fundamental                 
              understanding of the influence of physically controllable micro-               
              parameters on fiber reinforced composite materials, which will                 
              aid in the optimal design of this class of materials.
