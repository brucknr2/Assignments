Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                                         ABSTRACT                                            
                                                                                             
                  Intonation and prosody provide information unavailable in                 
              orthographic transcriptions, yet crucial to understanding the                  
              intended meaning of an utterance and to generating natural-                    
              sounding synthetic speech.  A full understanding of these                      
              phenomena is thus prerequisite to advance in many areas of                     
              linguistic research and technology.  This understanding requires               
              access to large labeled speech corpora.  Over the last year, a                 
              diverse group of researchers, from Electrical Engineers and                    
              Computer Scientists to Psychologists and Linguists, have                       
              cooperated in devising and testing a proposed standard prosodic                
              transcription system for the purpose of annotating large multi-                
              site shared corpora.  The next step in this cooperative effort is              
              to hold a workshop (1) to develop training materials for new                   
              transcribers and to plan tools for automating aspects of the                   
              transcription, (2) to investigate the full range of needs for                  
              prosodically annotated speech databases in the speech and natural              
              language research communities while coordinating plans for                     
              annotating existing data bases and for designing new ones in view              
              of these needs, and (3) to extend the standard to other dialects               
              of English.  The tangible products of the conference will be an                
              online training course and a volume of Conference Notes edited                 
              from the reports and discussion at the conference.
