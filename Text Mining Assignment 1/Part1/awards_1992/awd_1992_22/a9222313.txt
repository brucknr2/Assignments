Abstract    :
              Lucas  9222313    An important focus in the study of the functional significance
              of behavior has been  the impact of physiological state on the expression of
              foraging decisions.  In the  past, experimenters have imposed changes in hunger
              and mass on an animal and  have monitored the resulting changes in behavior. 
              However, behavioral systems  involve a feedback loop, because foraging
              decisions themselves will influence  further changes in physiological state. 
              Dr. Lucas's research will be one of the first  attempts to evaluate the entire
              feedback loop for a caching animal.    Food-caching behavior has often been
              seen as one mechanism that permits small  animals to live through energetically
              stressful periods, notably winter.  Dr. Lucas  has found that certain
              conditions actually retard the storage of food by chickadees,  and this in turn
              reduced the ability of these birds to maintain sufficient body mass  to survive
              when food was scarce.  The current reseearch is designed to study  conditions
              that affect the storage of energy, both in the form of body mass and  food
              stores.  Energy-storage tactics will in turn affect the ability of birds faced 
              with resource shortfall to alter their behavior in order to improve their
              chances of  survival.    Because Dr. Lucas will be studying regulation of body
              mass as well as food hoards,  his results will be broadly applicable to
              understanding regulation of energy and  body mass in any species, including
              humans.
