Abstract    :
              This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation Program                 
              will assist the Department of Chemistry at Indiana University                  
              Purdue University in the purchase of computer hardware and                     
              software for a Macromolecular Modeling System.  Two graphics                   
              workstations with ancillary data storage and output equipment                  
              and commercially available molecular graphics/scientific                       
              software will be networked together to create a computational                  
              chemistry facility for studies in macromolecular science.  The                 
              projects to be undertaken include:                                             
                                                                                             
              1)  Examination of the intermolecular forces responsible for                   
              chiral recognition of optical isomers binding to polymers such                 
              as cellulose, polymethacrylates and DNA.                                       
              2)  Computer-assisted molecular design and testing of                          
              bis-intercalating agents for sequence-specific binding sites on                
              DNA.                                                                           
              3)  An assessment of the unique micro environments made by                     
              polysiloxanes with pendant 4-aminopyridyl groups that fold into                
              highly efficient catalysts.                                                    
              4)  An investigation of the number, size, spatial distribution                 
              and electrostatic features of charge patches on proteins and                   
              why and how proteins interact with polyelectrolytes to form                    
              complex coacervates.                                                           
              5)  Designed catalysts as mimics of biological hydrolases and                  
              acyl-transferases.                                                             
                                                                                             
              %%%                                                                            
              The computer hardware and software in the macromolecular                       
              modeling system allows one to simulate interactions that take                  
              place in molecules in a real laboratory environment.  The                      
              insights and information one obtains from such calculations                    
              make it possible to design more efficient and more effective                   
              laboratory experiments.
