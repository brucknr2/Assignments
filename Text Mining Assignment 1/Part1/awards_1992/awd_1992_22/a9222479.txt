Abstract    :
                   The role of bacteria in recycling dissolved organic matter in             
              freshwater and marine environments is, at present, pooly known.                
              Yet because dissolved organic matter is one of the largest pools               
              of biospheric carbon, knowledge of the processes involved in its               
              formation and biological utilization is essential for a full                   
              understanding of global carbon cycling.  One particular class of               
              dissolved organic matter, the humic substances, is of particular               
              interest because it makes up a very large fraction of the total                
              dissolved substances (up to 80% in some natural environments) but              
              has been very poorly studied in the past.  We propose to examine               
              the bacterial processes involved in recycling (formation and                   
              utilization ) of dissolved humic substances in a freshwater wetland            
              in the southeastern United States (the Okefenokee Swamp Ecosystem).
