                  9222446 Lee  Microtubules are found in all animal cells and serve in a
              myriad of cellular functions.  These include cell division, cell movement, the
              transport of cellular components within the cell, the organization of cell
              organelles and the maintenance of cell shape.  Microtubule protein is most
              abundant in the brain, where it contributes to the highly specialized strucutre
              of neuronal cells.  Neuronal cell processes, the axons and dendrites, are
              filled with microtubules.  Associated with these microtubules are additional
              proteins which have been shown to promote the assembly of microtubules.  These
              proteins are known as microtubule-associated proteins.  The goal of our work is
              to study how a specific microtubule associated protein, named "tau", is
              involved in the growth of axons and what parts of the tau protein are required
              for activity.  Our biological system is a type of brain cell where tau protein
              is found in the cell's axon.  When these cells are treated with an inhibitor
              that depletes tau protein in the cells, the cells do not develop axons.  We
              plan to reintroduce fragments of tau protein into cells that have been
              inhibited to see what parts of the protein are required to restore the growth
              of the axon.  We also plan to introduce fragments of tau protein into cells to
              see which parts of tau protein are responsible for its properties of axonal
              growth and localization.  Lastly, we plan to introduce into brain cells hybrid
              proteins which compose partially of tau and partially of another
              microtubule-associated protein.  Among the microtubule-associated proteins we
              will try are "MAP2" protein, which localizes to the dendrites and is required
              for an earlier stage of proce ss growth and "MAP4" protein, which is not found
              in neuronal cells.  By introducing the hybrid proteins and looking to see
              whether axonal growth is normal and whether the hybrid protein localizes to the
              axon, these experiments will tell us which parts of tau protein are uniquely
              required for its neuronal functions.
