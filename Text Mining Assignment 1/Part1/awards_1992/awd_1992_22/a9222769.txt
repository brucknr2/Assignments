Abstract    :
                   It is becoming increasingly evident that reactions of gases at  solid
              interfaces play a key role in atmospheric chemistry.   However, at the present
              time, our understanding of the fundamental  kinetics and mechanisms of such
              reactions at interfaces in the  atmosphere is rudimentary, at best.  However,
              such data are  essential to elucidate the role of these processes in the
              chemistry  of both the stratosphere and troposphere.       This research will
              explore the fundamental kinetics and  dynamics of the reactions of solid NaCl,
              the major component of sea  salt particles found in marine areas, with gases
              such as HNO3 and  N2O5 using surface science techniques including X-ray
              photoelectron  spectroscopy, high resolution electron energy loss spectroscopy
              and  laser-induced desorption mass spectrometry.  These reactions are  believed
              to contribute to the formation of HCl and ClNO2  respectively.  The latter is
              of particular importance since its  photolysis produces chlorine atoms which
              may compete with OH in  initiating the oxidation of organics in the
              troposphere.  These  studies will result in a much better understanding of the 
              fundamental parameters controlling these gas-solid processes, which  can than
              be input to models to provide a more realistic and  accurate assessment of the
              role played by such reactions in the  atmosphere.  In addition, it will
              establish the utility of modern  surface science methodology in elucidating the
              fundamentals of  reactions occurring at interfaces in the atmosphere.
