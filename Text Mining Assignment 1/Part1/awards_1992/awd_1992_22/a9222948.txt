Abstract    :
                   Computer workstations and image sequence acquisition and                  
              processing equipment will be acquired and dedicated to research in             
              computer and information science and engineering.  The equipment               
              will be used for several research projects, all concerned with the             
              computational and algorithmic issues in processes and systems that             
              combine vision and motion.  These projects include:                            
                                                                                             
              (1) purposive vision in robot exploration of three-dimensional                 
              scenes,                                                                        
                                                                                             
              (2) analysis of dynamic photometric properties in image sequences,             
                                                                                             
              (3) motion planning for two whole-sensitive robot arm manipulators             
              sharing common space,                                                          
                                                                                             
              (4) sensor-based motion planning for a mobile robot operating in an            
              unstructured environment, and                                                  
                                                                                             
              (5) tracking moving objects using snake models.                                
                                                                                             
              This will provide facilities for image acquisition, processing,                
              motion planning and motion simulation, enabling these projects to              
              perform necessary experimental testing of the theoretical and                  
              algorithmic methods that are being developed.
