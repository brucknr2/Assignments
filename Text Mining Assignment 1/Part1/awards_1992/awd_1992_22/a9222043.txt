Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This proposal focuses on intracellular transport, "protein                     
              trafficking," in neurons.  Neurons, which are highly polarized                 
              cells, must synthesize, translocate, and package numerous                      
              intracellular, extracellular, and membrane proteins in order to                
              maintain their normal structure and function.  The photoreceptor is            
              an example of a highly polarized neuron which must produce and                 
              transfer membrane proteins to the outer segment proteins to the                
              interphotoreceptor space and synaptic terminal.  It is not entirely            
              clear how neurons handle the processing of so many proteins.                   
              Dr. Carter-Dawson proposes to use the photoreceptor cell as a model            
              to examine the processing of extracellular matrix constituents and             
              membrane glycoproteins.  In addition to providing information on               
              "protein trafficking" in neurons, this study will also provide                 
              additional information towards the long-term goal of characterizing            
              the interphotoreceptor matrix and visual cycle components in                   
              normal, developing, and mature retinas.
