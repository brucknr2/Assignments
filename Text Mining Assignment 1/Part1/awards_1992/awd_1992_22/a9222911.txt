Abstract    :
                   An ATM-based network multicomputer will be procured for                   
              several projects involving distributing computing.  These include              
              distributed single-address space systems, distributed                          
              implementation of a functional language with futures, distributed              
              FORTRAN D, distributed genome linkage analysis, and distributed                
              shared memory.
