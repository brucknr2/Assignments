Abstract    :
                   The main objective of this activity is to organize a                      
              conference on automation and computer integrated manufacturing for             
              batch and continuous process industries.  The conference will bring            
              together individuals from academia and industry who have common                
              interests in automation, production control, quality control and               
              related issues to stimulate exchange of ideas and collaboration.               
              The key issue is the focus on process industries.  Strong                      
              regulatory oversight and other conditions particular to process                
              environments have spurred innovative developments in control                   
              automation and quality assurance.                                              
                   This conference should result in a better understanding of                
              common important research topics of interest in the process                    
              industries.  Output of the workshop will include publication of                
              proceedings that will highlight these developments.
