Abstract    :
              9222891  Balsam    The aim of this research project is to develop a model system
              for the analysis of  the role of learning in behavioral development.  During
              development, experience  can affect all of the factors that control the
              expression of behavior as well as the  form of the response itself.  For
              example, in many species the factors that guide  feeding behavior change during
              development.  Many young animals eat under very  different circumstances than
              do the adults of that species.  Additionally, in many  species the form of the
              feeding response changes, as when young mammals go  from suckling to
              independent feeding.  In both of kinds of changes, experience  plays an
              important role.    Drs. Balsam and Deich are attempting to understand changes
              that occur over the  course of development by using principles of learning and
              memory to analyze  specific developmental transitions.  The model system in
              which they study these  processes is in the transition from dependent to
              independent feeding in ring doves.   Both the transitions in controls of
              feeding and changes in the form of feeding  responses will be described and the
              processes underlying the transitions will be  analyzed.  In addition to
              clarifying the role of learning in development, these  studies will contribute
              to a general methodology and theory for the study of the  induction and
              maintenance of new response forms.
