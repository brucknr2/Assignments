Abstract    :
              This proposal presents a novel idea                                            
              to integrate conventional finite                                               
              element methods with neural                                                    
              networks to achieve a fast, time-                                              
              saving, and highly accurate                                                    
              computational scheme for dynamic                                               
              analysis of complex structures.                                                
                                                                                             
              A one-year proof-of-concept study                                              
              will be conducted.  By presenting a                                            
              network with different complicated                                             
              structures, a computational system                                             
              will be developed which combines a                                             
              finite element program and a neural                                            
              net that can handle structures with                                            
              a stiffness matrix up to 500 x 500                                             
              under static or dynamic loading.                                               
                                                                                             
              The above model, if proven                                                     
              successful, has a potential to                                                 
              revolutionize many concepts in                                                 
              structural/earthquake engineering.                                             
              Different neural net modules - each                                            
              of which is trained to perform                                                 
              certain tasks such as analysis,                                                
              design, code provisions, etc. - may                                            
              be developed, and these modules                                                
              will be more reliable than and can                                             
              out perform human engineers.
