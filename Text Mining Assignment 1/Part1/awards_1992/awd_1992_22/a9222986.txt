Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This research is focussed on two projects.  The first part involves            
              continued studies on magnetites and zinc-ferrites.  The main thrust            
              of this research is directed to the investigation of nickel                    
              sulphide-selenide systems.  This material exhibits properties of a             
              good insulator, a good metal, or a metal-insulator for x values of             
              0, 2, and 0.5, respectively.  This property presumably is driven by            
              electron correlation effects.  The systems can be studied by                   
              varying the sulphide/selenide ratio while leaving the cation                   
              sublattice intact.  The following studies are planned:  growth of              
              single crystals, followed by adjustments of stoichiometry,                     
              electrical measurements, magnetization investigations, specific                
              heat studies, structural research, and optical measurements.  The              
              data acquisition is not just of intrinsic interest but is to be                
              used to identify the changeover from the insulating state, through             
              a narrow band correlated state, to the metal-insulated transition              
              regime, and into the region of good metallic behavior, during which            
              the lattice remains basically unaltered.  The data thus serve as a             
              test for current theories of electron transport in the various                 
              regimes.
