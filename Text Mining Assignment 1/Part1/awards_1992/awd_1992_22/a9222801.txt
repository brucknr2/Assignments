Abstract    :
              In this project in the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program                 
              of the Chemistry Division, Stwalley will study the electronic                  
              spectroscopy of diatomic alkali molecules in "long range                       
              states" in which internuclear distances are larger than about                  
              10 Angstroms.  Knowledge of the energy levels in this region                   
              gives information about long-range potential energy curves,                    
              which is important for understanding photodissociation and                     
              associative ionization processes.  Optical-optical double                      
              resonance (OODR) and All-Optical Triple Resonance (AOTR) will                  
              be used to study the spectroscopy and dynamics of these                        
              processes state selectively.                                                   
              %%%                                                                            
              In the experiments being conducted in this project, lasers are                 
              used to determine various properties of diatomic molecules as                  
              well as to study light-induced processes in these two-atom                     
              molecules.  Among the information to be gathered are data                      
              regarding photodissociation (bond-breaking induced by light)                   
              and associative ionization (bond-forming with attendant loss of                
              an electron).  Fundamental information such as this has impact                 
              on our understanding of a variety of areas, including                          
              atmospheric processes and materials processing using lasers or                 
              plasmas.
