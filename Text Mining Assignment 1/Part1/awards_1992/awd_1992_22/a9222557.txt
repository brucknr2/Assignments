Abstract    :
              This project plans to map the                                                  
              fluxes, enzyme activities, and                                                 
              metabolic levels for key reactions                                             
              in the glycolytic pathway and the                                              
              tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle for                                             
              two common bacteria, E. coli and B.                                            
              subtilis.  Both wild-type and                                                  
              metabolic mutants will be examined                                             
              in order to obtain regulatory                                                  
              insights and alternative yield                                                 
              scenarios.  Four areas are expected                                            
              to be impacted.  First, an improved                                            
              understanding of how the TCA cycle                                             
              and glycolysis are coordinated                                                 
              would be obtained.  Secondly, the                                              
              magnitude of the energy spilling                                               
              reactions would be determined.                                                 
              Thirdly, the results could prove                                               
              useful to developing cultivation                                               
              conditions that promote the maximal                                            
              conversion of carbon to cell mass.                                             
              Finally, metabolic engineering                                                 
              strategies could be identified that                                            
              would allow one to alter the                                                   
              regulation of the cell in an                                                   
              optimal manner.
