Abstract    :
              This workshop is intended to bring together Arctic social                      
              scientists working on several ongoing US/Russian projects and                  
              native leaders to help map future directions of international                  
              collaboration. One goal is to establish better links with Native               
              leaders in analyzing and building management regimes for Arctic                
              living resources. A common theme running through the work of                   
              these various projects is, above all, the need to develop                      
              innovative institutional arrangements capable of accommodating                 
              regional and international perspectives associated with whole                  
              ecosystems, and the concerns of local, largely indigenous,                     
              groups.
