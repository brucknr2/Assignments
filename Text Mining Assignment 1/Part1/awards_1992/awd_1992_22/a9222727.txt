Abstract    :
              9222727  Duncan    This is a longitudinal study of income dynamics and other
              social  processes among Hispanics.  It builds upon a survey administered in 
              1990 to a national sample of 2,043 Latino households that had  participated in
              the 1989 Latino National Political Survey.  In 1991  and 1992, reinterviews
              were conducted with these same households,  producing longitudinal information
              on income, employment, and  family structure dynamics, comparable to data
              collected at the same  time on the original sample of the Panel Study of Income
              Dynamics.   The present project will extend this time series of annual 
              interviews with Latino sample households to 1996, and a special  effort will be
              made to secure interviews with households that had  become nonresponse since
              1989.    This research will provide a substantial information base that 
              follows Hispanics over a period of years, allowing social  scientists in
              several disciplines to trace changes in families and  their incomes over time. 
              When combined with the already-funded  Panel Study of Income Dynamics which
              studies chiefly non-Hispanics,  this extensive new data set will answer many
              scientific and policy  questions about the opportunities and life courses of
              Hispanics,  including Hispanic immigrants.    ***
