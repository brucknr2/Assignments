Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Dr. Nowak's research is aimed at obtaining additional knowledge of             
              the mechanisms underlying N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA)                          
              receptor-channel function in mammalian brain neurons.  The NMDA                
              subclass of glutamate receptors are coupled to nonselective cation             
              channels permeable to Ca2+ and blocked by Mg2+ in a voltage-dependent          
              way.  It is Ca2+ entry through NMDA channels which is thought to               
              serve as a trigger for some of the plastic changes observed during             
              nervous system development and in learning.  Thus, the overall goal            
              of the research is to address the question, "how can the apparently            
              high influx of Ca2+ through NMDA channels as demonstrated by dye               
              measurements be reconciled with all of the factors which would tend            
              to limit Ca2+ entry"?  One possible explanation is that there is               
              more diversity among NMDA receptor-channels than previously                    
              recognized with some putative forms of the channels being                      
              relatively insensitive to blockage by Mg2+.  Dr. Nowak's first                 
              series of experiments will involve an examination of the                       
              similarities and differences in biophysical parameters between NMDA            
              channels in cerebellar granule cells and cortical neurons where                
              different forms of the channels are predicted to occur.  She will              
              then perform additional experiments designed to examine the                    
              potential sites of Ca2+ interaction with NMDA channels.  All of the            
              proposed experiments are designed to explore the fundamental                   
              role(s) played by two divalent cations found in physiological                  
              fluids, namely Ca2+ and Mg2+ ions, in regulating the functioning of            
              a major class of neurotransmitter-activated receptor-channels in               
              brain neurons.
