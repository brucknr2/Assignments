Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                                                                                            
              The nervous system is composed of two main cell types, neurons and             
              glia.  The long term objective of this research is to elucidate the            
              molecular mechanism responsible for development of the glial versus            
              neuronal cell identity in the nervous system.  The regulation of               
              two genes, S100B and Glial Fibrillary Acidic Protein, will be                  
              studied.  Both of these genes are expressed in glial cells but not             
              in neuronal cells.  These genes will be studies in a cell line                 
              developed by this laboratory from a tumor of neuronal origin.  The             
              primary focus of the current study is to identify and characterize             
              the control elements in these genes that are responsible for                   
              turning on and/or off the production of these proteins in this cell            
              line.  These studies are fundamental to our understanding of the               
              development of the nervous system.***
