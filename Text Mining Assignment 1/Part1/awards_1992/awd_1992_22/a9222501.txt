Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                                         ABSTRACT                                            
                                                                                             
                                                                                            
              The general goal of the proposed project is to investigate the                 
              syntax--semantics interface through an investigation of a                      
              constraint known as the "weak island effect." The project aims to              
              reinterpret and revise some recent developments in the research                
              of weak islands, using algebraic semantics. The two central                    
              hypothesis are as follows: (i) The weak island effect is a scope               
              phenomenon, and (ii) The scope-taking abilities of WH-phrases and              
              other operators are determined by their denotational semantic                  
              properties as well as their syntactic positions. Cross-linguistic              
              comparisons involving specific phenomena in English, Hungarian,                
              and Dutch will be used to facilitate the clarification of how                  
              syntax and semantics interact. The results will be accommodated                
              in Government-binding theory and in Categorial Grammar.
