Abstract    :
              Iron and steel making have traditionally formed the backbone of                
              industrial strength.  As early as 1770, Americans built up their               
              iron industry to the third largest in the world.  They produced                
              increasing amounts of iron through the 19th century.  By the 20th              
              century Americans led the world in iron and steel production.  Dr.             
              Gordon is tracing the development of the American iron industry.               
                                                                                             
              Three research questions shape his study.  The first concerns                  
              innovation and the transfer of technology.  Dr. Gordon is seeking              
              to demonstrate that while most of the techniques that Americans had            
              used for making and shaping iron and its alloys originated in                  
              Europe, few of these techniques were useful until local artisans               
              substantially modified them and raised them to higher levels of                
              technological development than were ever attained in Europe.  The              
              second question concerns the growth of competence among American               
              artisans.   Third, he is exploring the changing attitudes towards              
              the use of natural resources and the environment in the development            
              of techniques in this energy-intensive industry.                               
                                                                                             
              In order to carry out this study, Dr. Gordon is using                          
              archaeological data and archaeometric methods to supplement the                
              historical records.  Laboratory data are particularly important for            
              this study in dealing with questions about the quality of products             
              made in the past and metallurgical processes that were poorly                  
              recorded.  Metallographic studies and microprobe analyses of slags             
              and metal artifacts allow Dr. Gordon and his assistants to                     
              determine how processes worked and the reasons for technological               
              success or failure.  He is using field observations to locate                  
              sources of artifacts for laboratory study and to examine the long-             
              term environmental consequences of ironmaking.
