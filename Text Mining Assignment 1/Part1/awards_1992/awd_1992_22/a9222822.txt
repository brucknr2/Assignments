Abstract    :
              In this study in the Theoretical and Computational Chemistry                   
              Program in the Division of Chemistry ab initio electronic                      
              structure methods are being used to study the ground and                       
              excited states of molecular systems.  The focus is on the                      
              comparison of various multi-reference correlation methods and                  
              on the testing of combined perturbative-variational approaches.                
              Applications include studies of excited states of diatomic                     
              molecules near avoided crossings, low-lying excited states of                  
              polyenes and other conjugated species, and the ground-state                    
              properties of both symmetrical and asymmetrical alkali halide                  
              dimers.

              Modern computer-based computational methods are being used in                  
              this study to characterize the energies and shapes of a number                 
              of different types of molecules both in their ground and                       
              excited states.  These molecular types include diatomics such                  
              as oxygen, carbon monoxide, and aluminum hydride, various                      
              hydrocarbons, and such high-temperature species as that formed                 
              by two sodium chloride molecules bound together.
