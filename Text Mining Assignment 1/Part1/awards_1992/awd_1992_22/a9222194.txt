Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Why are events with emotional significance remembered with                     
              particular intensity?  Current evidence suggests that the autonomic            
              activity that accompanies emotional experiences in a way that                  
              facilitates later recall.  A popular paradigm for investigating                
              this phenomenon is the conditioned heart rate deceleration that                
              occurs to a stimulus that has become frightening because of                    
              previous association with pain or suffering.  With this NSF award,             
              Dr. McCabe will investigate the changes that occur in neuronal                 
              firing as stimuli change meaning from neutral to frightening and               
              then as they lose their significance through desensitization.  He              
              will use sophisticated neurophysiological techniques to record from            
              single neurons in two brain areas simultaneously.  The information             
              he gains from studying changes in the firing patterns in these two             
              areas will identify the steps involved in the neuronal coding of               
              emotional meaning.  This kind of information is crucial for the                
              development of therapies designed to reverse the effects of early              
              emotional trauma and also to control the abnormal autonomic                    
              reactivity that occurs in many cardiovascular diseases.  It will               
              also prove important for the design of neural nets for information             
              processing, storage and retrieval.***//
