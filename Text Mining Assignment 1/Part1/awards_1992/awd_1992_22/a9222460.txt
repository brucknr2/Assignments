Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  This proposal requests support to analyze observations                    
              obtained during the Convection and Precipitation/Electrification               
              Experiment (CaPE) conducted in central Florida during the summer of            
              1992.  Simultaneous traverses through convective clouds by two                 
              similarly equipped King Airs are the focus of the proposed work.               
              Emphasis will be on the evolution of the kinematic fields within               
              those cumuli that were sampled with more than a dozen passes during            
              their life cycle.  The two-aircraft pattern will provide                       
              observations of the basic characteristics of the near-environment,             
              visible cloud, updraft and downdraft, and the horizontal flow in               
              and at the edges of these features.  Vertical mass flux and                    
              momentum transport as a function of life cycle will be estimated               
              for several of the better observed cases.  The analyses have the               
              potential to be the bench-mark for the kinematic structure of moist            
              convection in an environment characterized by low shear and high               
              convective available potential energy.
