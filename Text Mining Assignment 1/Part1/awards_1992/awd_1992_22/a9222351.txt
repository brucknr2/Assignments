Abstract    :
              This grant from the Organic Dynamics Program supports the                      
              continuing work of Professor Jay K. Kochi at the University of                 
              Houston. The study will develop general concepts of chemical                   
              reactivity based on electron donor-acceptor interactions. The three            
              principal methodologies in which electron-transfer will be induced             
              are (a) chemical oxidants and reducing reagents, (b)                           
              electrochemical oxidation and reduction, and (c) photochemical                 
              quenching and charge-transfer excitation. Specifically, work will              
              be carried out on: (1) application of the charge-transfer                      
              formulation to organic activation; (2) photo-induced electron                  
              transfer in charge-transfer ion pairs; (3) oxometals in high                   
              oxidation states as electron acceptors, (4) charge-transfer                    
              activation of hydrocarbon donors on metal oxide surfaces; (5)                  
              organometallic charge-transfer crystals and polymers.                          
              %%%                                                                            
              In this project by Professor Jay K. Kochi the broad applicability              
              of the electron donor-acceptor concept to a variety of organic and             
              organometallic systems will be exploited to develop new synthetic              
              procedures as well as catalytic oxidations both in solution and in             
              the solid state. The utilization of the charge-transfer phenomenon             
              in chemical dynamics especially of transient ions and radicals in              
              solution and with potential application to solar energy storage and            
              molecular memories and switches is included. The synthesis of                  
              various types of solid state charge-transfer complexes will be                 
              conducted because of their semiconductor and ferromagnetic behavior            
              as well as their unusual optical and magnetic properties.
