Abstract    :
              A symposium, "Non-Mendelian Inheritance" will be held at Michigan              
              State University on March 27 and 28.  The topic is broadly defined             
              so that speakers and participants will be from areas of research               
              which do not normally interact.  Students and faculty from near-by             
              undergraduate institutions will be encouraged to attend.
