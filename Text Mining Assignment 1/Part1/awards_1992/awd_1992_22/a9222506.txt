Abstract    :
                   This award supports the development of an array of millennium-            
              long tree-ring chronologies for the southeastern USA.  These long              
              chronologies are sensitive to precipitation, and reflect anomalies             
              in large-scale atmospheric circulation over eastern North American             
              and the western North Atlantic.  This work will also develop                   
              centuries-long chronologies in the southern Great Plains and Mexico            
              which are sensitive to anomalies in the EL Nino/Southern                       
              Oscillation (ENSO), the most important known cause of interannual              
              to decadal variation in global climate.  The network of ENSO-                  
              sensitive tree-ring chronologies will be expanded in Mexico and the            
              Southeast in order to develop longer ENSO reconstructions, to                  
              explore possible changes in the ENSO phenomenon during the Little              
              Ice Age, and to estimate the frequency of ENSO extremes such as the            
              1982-83 warm event.  The potential for dendroclimatology will also             
              be explored in East Africa, where and ENSO influence on climate has            
              been detected, but where long, annual climate proxies are not                  
              presently available.  The proposed research will provide unique                
              paleoclimatic data that will help define the natural variability of            
              climate, and may help evaluate GCM-simulations of climate during               
              global warm and cool episodes of the late Holocene.
