Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                                         ABSTRACT                                            
                                                                                             
                                                                                            
              The aim of this research is to produce a definitive lexicon of                 
              Wiyot, a native American language of a northern California whose               
              last living speaker died in 1962. A previous NSF grant has been                
              applied to phase I. This part of the project, now complete, has                
              as                                                                             
              its issue the Wiyot Glossary, a lexical index  to Teeter's The                 
              Wiyot language (1964). In phase II, the glossary is expanded into              
              a comprehensive Wiyot Lexicon, which takes as its subject the                  
              entire corpus of materials collected by Teeter (in field notes                 
              and                                                                            
              on tape), and by anthropologists Gladys A. Reichard and Alfred L.              
              Kroeber. This should approximately double or triple the number of              
              entries of the glossary and lead to a lexicon covering everything              
              ever recorded on Wiyot.
