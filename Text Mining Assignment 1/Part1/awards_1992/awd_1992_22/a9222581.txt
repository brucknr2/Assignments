Abstract    :
              This project will support the Prinicpal Investigator to spend                  
              one-half year of his sabbatical leave at the University of Wales,              
              Cardiff, United Kingdom.  The Principal Investigator will                      
              participate in joint research projects in the area of creep and                
              loss of prestress in masonry with Prof. David Lenczner of the                  
              University of Wales, who is a world authority in these areas.
