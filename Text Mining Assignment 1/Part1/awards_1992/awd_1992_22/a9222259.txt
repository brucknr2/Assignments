Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This Small Grant for Exploratory Research undertakes a survey of               
              candidates running for the US House of Representatives in the 1992             
              elections, as part of an international, comparative study including            
              Britain, Australia, New Zealand, Canada and the United States.                 
                                                                                             
              The survey will permit a comparative study of American, Canadian,              
              Australian, British national legislative elections.  Surveys in                
              Britain and Australia have been fielded, while the Canadian study              
              has been funded in anticipation of the 1993 elections.  The funding            
              will allow the investigators to field the survey and accomplish the            
              following objectives:  compare the social background, motives, and             
              political experience of legislative candidates; analyze                        
              similarities and differences in the recruitment process to national            
              legislatures; compare factors affecting female and minority                    
              representation; analyze the relationship between the attitudes,                
              values and opinions of representatives and the general public; and,            
              determine the relation between the recruitment process and the                 
              nature of representation.                                                      
                                                                                             
              This study allows a comparative investigation and promises to make             
              substantial contributions to our understanding of candidate                    
              motives, values and attitudes.
