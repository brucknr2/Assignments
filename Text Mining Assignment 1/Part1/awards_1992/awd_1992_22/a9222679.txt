              McVaugh 9222679 This project will continue the compilation of a descriptive,
              illustrated flora of western Mexico begun in 1951 and now approximately 50%
              complete.  This area of Mexico is among the most diverse botanically.  Seven
              volumes will be published by 1993 covering the conifers, ferns and
              monocotylodons and two large groups of dicotylodons; this renewal will treat a
              number of the remaining dicotylodon groups.  Although this flora has been
              issued in traditional treatments, the project has now begun to capture
              electronically the relevant collections in Mexican herbaria, so that in future
              the primary product will be an updatable floral database that will be used by
              researchers and land managers in various botanical studies and conservation
              measures.  Collaborators include Mexican herbaria, at which the collections
              will continue to be used to train students.     (#

              project involves an exhaustive survey and compilation of the flora of western
              Mexico, which is among the most diverse areas botanically.  The project began
              in 1951 and the descriptive, illustrated flora is projected to be published in
              17 volumes.  Although this flora has been issued in traditional treatments, the
              project has now begun to computerize the relevant collections in Mexican
              herbaria, so that in future the primary product will be an updatable floral
              database that will be used by researchers and land managers  in various
              botanical studies and conservation measures.  At the University of Michigan and
              at the collaborating Mexican herbaria the project's botanical collections are
              fundamental resources for training students and for research projects in
              maintaining and understanding this regional biodiversity.      (#
