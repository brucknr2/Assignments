Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Dr. Page will examine the gene structure, distribution of gene                 
              expression, and ligand specificity of two biogenic amine receptors             
              whose genes have been cloned.  Biogenic amines modulate behavior               
              similarly in both invertebrates and vertebrates.  They are                     
              particularly interesting due to their implication in human                     
              neurological disorders including schizophrenia, manic depression,              
              and drug addiction.  Some insects provide an ideal model system for            
              studying the role of biogenic amines in behavioral control due to              
              the caste structure of their societies which results in the                    
              division of stereotypic behavioral repertoires between individuals             
              according to sex, caste, and age.  Dr. Page's work will provide a              
              complete molecular genetic characterization of two insect receptor             
              genes.  This will include the localization of gene expression in               
              the central nervous system in insects of each sex and caste.                   
              Antibodies will be produced for each of the receptor proteins for              
              use in protein regulation studies.  Finally, the receptors will be             
              expressed in Baculovirus transfected insect cells and a ligand                 
              binding profile of each receptor will be determined.  This work                
              will provide the basis for future studies describing the genetic               
              basis of behavioral control and social integration.
