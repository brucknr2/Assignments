Abstract    :
                   This award is for renewed funding of a diverse program of                 
              research in elementary particle physics.  Support is requested                 
              for a senior faculty member, a postdoctoral research associate                 
              and one - two graduate students during the requested three                     
              year grant period.  The planned program consists of                            
              participation in four activities:  continued analysis of data                  
              of three experiments taken some years ago at Fermilab, R&D on                  
              muon subsystems and solar cells as active calorimeter elements                 
              aimed at a detector to run at SSC early next century, continued                
              construction of the MACRO detector at the Gran Sasso underground               
              laboratory in Italy, and a search for magnetic monopoles possibly              
              trapped in meteorites that landed in Antarctica.  Approval will                
              be asked of the Fermilab Program Advisory Committee to build and               
              install at the Tevatron a prototypical detector to study high                  
              rapidity products of p-p collisions.
