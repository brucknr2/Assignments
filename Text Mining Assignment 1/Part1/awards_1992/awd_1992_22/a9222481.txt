Abstract    :
              Abraham         This research is on fault modeling and test generation for 
              mixed signal integrated circuits.  In the area of fault models,  defect and
              yield statistics are being used to derive  comprehensive fault models for
              analog circuits.  These include  functional fault models useable in design for
              test and test  generation.  New test generation algorithms are being derived
              for  analog circuits, and techniques are being developed to interface  the
              analog tests with the digital circuitry in a mixed signal  circuit.  The
              fundamental theories are being validated  experimentally with designs and data
              from industry.
