Abstract    :
              The focus of this research is to study the behavior of roof                    
              trusses fabricated using cold-formed members and connections.                  
              Both full-scale and sub-assembly tests of steel roof trusses will              
              be conducted.  The test specimens will be representative of                    
              industry design, fabrication, and erection practices.  Of                      
              particular interest will be the behavior of the connections, to                
              include eccentricities resulting from the use of C-shaped members              
              connected back-to-back, and the use of self-drilling screws as                 
              connectors.  Emphasis will be placed on defining the member                    
              buckling characteristics and the influence of the end-restraint                
              effect of the end connections.  This is a cooperative project                  
              with the American Iron and Steel Institute.//
