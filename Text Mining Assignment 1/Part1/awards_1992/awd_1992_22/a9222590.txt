Abstract    :
              In this project,  supported by the Physical Chemistry Program                  
              of the Chemistry Division, Prof. C. Johnson of the University                  
              of North Carolina at Chapel Hill will conduct research in the                  
              area of diffusion-ordered two-dimensional nuclear magnetic                     
              resonance spectroscopy.  This research will be devoted to the                  
              development of techniques and instrumentation, and their                       
              applications to chemical exchange effects, binding equilibria                  
              involving surfactants and macromolecules, and micelles and                     
              micellanes.  Work will also be done on the continued                           
              development of mobility-ordered two-dimensional nuclear                        
              magnetic resonance spectroscopy with special emphasis on                       
              electrokinetic studies  and data analysis for the diffusion and                
              mobility of vesicles ranging in size from 50 to 200 nanometers.

              The relaxation rates observed in nuclear magnetic resonance                    
              spectra of condensed media are affected by frictional effects                  
              determined by the sizes and shapes of molecules as they undergo                
              translational and reorientational motions in the medium.  The                  
              recently developed technique of diffusion-ordered                              
              two-dimensional nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy allows                 
              the identification of molecular components of mixtures and the                 
              simultaneous characterization of the sizes of aggregates and                   
              other structures present.  Using a variation of this technique,                
              mobility-ordered two-dimensional nuclear magnetic resonance                    
              spectroscopy, one is able to identify and determine the                        
              mobilities of ions in condensed media.  The research by                        
              Professor Johnson serves to improve on these methods and extend                
              them into the three dimensional domain.
