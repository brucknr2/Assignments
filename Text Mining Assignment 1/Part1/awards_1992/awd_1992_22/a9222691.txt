Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              High speed computer networks support shared databases and new                  
              modes of collaboration in several scientific areas.  These                     
              capabilities have yet to be widely applied to materials science                
              and engineering, a large, geographically scattered, innately                   
              multidisciplinary area of national importance.  The Southeastern               
              Universities Research Association (SURA) request support for a                 
              workshop to determine ho the materials community could best                    
              benefit from high speed computer networks.                                     
                                                                                             
              Network capabilities and database and conferencing technology                  
              such as dial-up video service would demonstrated in this tow day               
              workshop.                                                                      
                                                                                             
              This conference will bring together many academic and government               
              representatives from the numerous materials science and                        
              engineering constituencies and from the networking technology                  
              community who are essential for the design, development,                       
              deployment, and operation of a robust, high performance computer               
              network.  This effort is in step with federal initiatives in high              
              performance computing and its plans to meet pressing needs for                 
              improved research collaboration and productivity in the United                 
              States.***
