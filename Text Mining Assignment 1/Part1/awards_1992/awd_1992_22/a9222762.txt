Abstract    :
              Scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) and atomic force microscopy                
              (AFM) are being used to directly image isolated fullerene molecules            
              and obtain a mapping of their local density of states.  The                    
              structure and electronic properties of the fullerenes are being                
              studied by the surface microscopy tools.  Fullerene-metal,                     
              fullerene-semiconductor, and fullerene-molecule interactions in                
              condensed films are under study.  Preparation of composite                     
              fullerene materials will be carried out using C-60 molecules                   
              embedded in methyl isobutyl ketone films.  The latter have revealed            
              pronounced intermolecular contrast, the origins of which are being             
              investigated in this project.  Finally, the tip-sample interactions            
              involved in the microscopy technique is being investigated with the            
              objective of improving the utility of these techniques.

              This project concerns the characterization, by surface microscopy,             
              of a technologically important group of the recently discovered                
              fullerene molecules.  Materials composed of these molecules have               
              recently demonstrated dramatic properties of interest to solid                 
              state physicists as well as materials scientists and chemists.  The            
              proposed research will provide information about the structure and             
              electronic properties of these materials.  This information is of              
              fundamental interest and should pave the way toward practical                  
              application of these materials.
