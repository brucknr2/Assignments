Abstract    :
                   Central College is establishing a connection to NSFNET via a              
              56,000 bits per second line through the MIDNET mid-level network.              
              The connection enables the school's faculty and students to                    
              communicate and collaborate with the international scientific and              
              educational community, and to access network resources such as                 
              libraries, databases and supercomputers.  This award funds part of             
              the costs for two years.
