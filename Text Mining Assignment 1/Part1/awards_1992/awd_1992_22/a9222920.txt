Abstract    :
              Normal function of the nervous system depends on the proper number             
              of specific neuron types.  This comes about during development                 
              through a complicated balance of cell generation and cell death.               
              This project will investigate various factors that control these               
              two processes, particularly the role of certain hormones.  This                
              project will result in a better understanding of how the nervous               
              system develops.***//
