Abstract    :
              Southern Arkansas University is establishing a connection to NSFNET            
              via a 56,000 bits per second line through the State of Arkansas                
              ARKNET and MIDNET mid-level networks. The connection enables the               
              school's faculty and students to communicate and collaborate with              
              the international scientific and edicational community, and to                 
              access network resources such as libraries, databases and                      
              supercomputers.  This award funds part of the costs for two years.
