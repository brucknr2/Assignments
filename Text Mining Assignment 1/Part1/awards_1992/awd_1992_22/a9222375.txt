Abstract    :
              Professor Onak of California State Los Angeles University will                 
              conduct studies of carborane chemistry with funding from the                   
              Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic Program;  the award                
              is made through the Research in Undergraduate Institutions                     
              program of NSF.  The research to be conducted focuses on the                   
              reactivity of carboranes.  Specifically, experiments will be                   
              conducted to probe the partial cage opening of closo-C2B6H8 and                
              other carboranes with hydride ion, amines, and fluoride ion.                   
              Carborane rearrangements and equilibria among carboranes will                  
              also be explored, as will cage growth and insertions.  2D NMR                  
              and IGLO calculations will be prominent among the methodologies                
              to be used.                                                                    
              %%%                                                                            
              Chemical research will be conducted on the reactivity of                       
              molecules that are based on cage-shaped clusters of carbon and                 
              boron atoms.  These molecules place the carbon atoms in                        
              extraordinary environments in which they can be bonded to as                   
              many as 6 other atoms.  Experiments will be conducted to                       
              discover, assess, and develop methods to "open" the cages, to                  
              alter the arrangement of the atoms within the cages, and to                    
              increase the number of atoms that constitute the cages.  This                  
              fundamental research will lead to general insights regarding                   
              the chemistry of cage-type molecules.
