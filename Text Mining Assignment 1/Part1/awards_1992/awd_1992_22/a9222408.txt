Abstract    :
              Liu         The research is on algorithms for high level synthesis and  layout
              of VLSI CAD designs.  Algorithms for complex, large  industrial type design
              problems are being developed.  Research  topics include:  1.     high level
              synthesis with testability as an important  goodness measure,  2.     timing
              driven placement algorithms for EPGAs, and  3.     channel and switchbox
              routing in which the effect of cross  talk is to be taken into consideration.  
                    For the first problem, the effect of register allocation and  functional
              unit binding on the testability of the circuit is  being examined.  Then the
              scheduling step is being examined.   Research on the second problem is based on
              the notion of a  "neighborhood graph" which is used in guiding an iterative 
              improvement algorithm that produces placements which satisfy  given timing
              constraints.  An integer programming approach is  being used for the third
              problem, because this avoids parallel  long wires that are close together in
              the routing solution.
