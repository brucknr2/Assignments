Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The anatomical organization of the sense of smell involves                     
              projections from the olfactory primary receptor cells to                       
              connect at synapses on particular cells within the central                     
              nervous system.  The synapses form particular ball-like                        
              structures called glomeruli, composed of neuronal terminals,                   
              or neuropil, from incoming and central nerve cells.  This                      
              fundamental plan of glomerular organization has been conserved                 
              in animals as diverse as snails, insects, fish, rodents and                    
              humans, suggesting it may be important in the recognition and                  
              discrimination of various odors detected by the multiple                       
              olfactory receptors.  This work uses a multidisciplinary                       
              approach of electrophysiological, pharmacological  and                         
              immunocytochemical techniques in an invertebrate model system                  
              to determine how regionalized processing within and among                      
              glomeruli shapes the odor sensitivity of the glomerulus.  The                  
              basic organizational plan of this olfactory region suggests                    
              that results will be important for our general understanding                   
              of the poorly known mechanisms for chemosensory coding, and of                 
              the relation of central nervous system structure to function                   
              in sensory processing.
