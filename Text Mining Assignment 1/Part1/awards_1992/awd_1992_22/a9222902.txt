Abstract    :
                   Studies are continued and extended of the potentially                     
              observable consequences of the general theory of relativity,                   
              in experimental, astrophysical and cosmological contexts.  A                   
              study of the inspiral and coalescence of binary systems of                     
              compact objects (neutron stars or black holes) and of the                      
              gravitational radiation emitted will be continued, using high-                 
              order post-Newtonian approximations to general relativity.                     
              The results will be of importance to the U.S. Laser                            
              Interferometric Gravitational Observatory (LIGO).  Professor                   
              Will will study the possibility of placing a complete                          
              observational bound on post-Newtonian metric gravity using                     
              current observations and minimal theoretical assumptions.                      
              Studies of tests of the Einstein equivalence principle will                    
              continue, including tests of the isotropy of the one-way speed                 
              of light and tests of a nonsymmetric spacetime metric using                    
              trapped atoms.  The cosmological effects of massive scalar                     
              fields, whose coupling to gravity produces a rapidly                           
              oscillating Newtonian coupling constant will be studied, as                    
              will the effects of relic gravitational perturbations emerging                 
              from the very early universe in "squeezed" quantum states.
