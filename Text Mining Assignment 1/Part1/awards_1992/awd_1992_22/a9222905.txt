Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  Video display and recording equipment shall be purchased to               
              augment existing research equipment in order to allow simulation of            
              the effects of various algorithms and errors on the quality of                 
              digital video sequences under realistic viewing conditions.                    
              Particular projects include:                                                   
                                                                                             
              *  Compression of video data.                                                  
                                                                                             
              *  Restoration and enhancement of video data through nonlinear and             
                nonstationary filtering.                                                     
                                                                                             
              *  Visual communication system channel error effect compensation.
