Abstract    :
                   This award is for research by a senior University of                      
              Houston faculty member, a research assistant professor and a                   
              graduate student.  The project has three distinct component                    
              activities.  The major effort is the SMC experiment at CERN,                   
              which studies inelastic scattering of polarized muons on                       
              polarized protons and deuterons.  In this way information is                   
              gotten on the underlying quark constituent contribution to the                 
              nucleon spin, the spin-dependent structure functions.  The                     
              group continues to be involved in R&D for the GEM detector to                  
              operate at the SSC.  Some attention continues to be given LVD                  
              still in construction at Gran Sasso in Italy.  LVD is expected                 
              to detect neutrinos emitted in stellar collapse, gather                        
              information about possible oscillations among neutrino types                   
              and seek evidence of proton decay.
