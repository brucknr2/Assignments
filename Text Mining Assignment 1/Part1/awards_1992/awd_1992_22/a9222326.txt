Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Discovery and Analysis of Extremely Low Metallicity Stars,                     
              Horizontal Branch Stars, and A-Type Stars in the Galactic Halo.                
                                                                                             
              Dr Beers will carry out follow-up spectroscopic and photometric                
              observations of candidate low metallicity stars, field horizontal              
              branch stars, and apparent main sequence A-type stars discovered               
              in an ongoing survey. Observations of the low metallicity                      
              candidates will provide a significant increase in the numbers of               
              stars with metal abundances less than 1/1000th of the solar                    
              value, thereby enabling a wide range of investigations concerning              
              the formation and evolution of our Galaxy.
