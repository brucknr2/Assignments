Abstract    :
              The International Workshop on Graph Grammars and Their                         
              Application to computer Science will be held in Williamsburg,                  
              Virginia between 14 and 19 November, l993.  It is intended to                  
              bring together leading researchers in graph grammar theory and                 
              applications to discuss open problems which are most critical                  
              to practical applications.  A diverse range of areas including                 
              programming languages, software engineering, massively                         
              parallel computation, knowledge-based systems, developmental                   
              biology, and picture processing shall be represented.  The                     
              highly interactive format of the workshop should encourage and                 
              enable a synthesis of theoretical and practical concerns from                  
              diverse communities.
