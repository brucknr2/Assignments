Abstract    :
                   The ocean technologies have significant economic and                      
              scientific impact to our nation.  An Industry/University                       
              Cooperative Research Center on Ocean Technology at the University              
              of Rhode Island could provide a better mechanism to advance the                
              development and application of basic research on ocean                         
              technologies.                                                                  
                   A planning meeting will study if industry will support an                 
              Industry/University Cooperative Research Center on Ocean Technology            
              to be headquartered at the University of Rhode Island.  The meeting            
              will asses industry interest and determine if the Center has                   
              sufficient support and merit to meet the Industry/University                   
              Cooperative Research Centers Program criteria.  The proposed                   
              research projects will address:1) development of analytical                    
              techniques for environmental monitoring; 2) equipment development              
              and testing; 3) development of hardware and software for collection            
              and processing of under water acoustics and optics data.                       
                   The Principal Investigator is recognized as an eminent                    
              researcher and has the resource for this planning meeting.                     
                   This project has been coordinated with Dr. Norman Caplan,                 
              Program Director of the Environmental and Ocean Systems Program in             
              the Division of Biological and Critical Systems at the National                
              Science Foundation.                                                            
                   The Program Director recommends the University of Rhode Island            
              be awarded $9,892 for one year for this planning meeting.
