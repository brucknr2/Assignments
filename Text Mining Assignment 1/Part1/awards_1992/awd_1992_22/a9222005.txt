Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This research project will test four hypotheses about                          
              evolutionary forces that affect the behavior of pair-bonded birds              
              to each other and to the nestlings they raise:  1.  Male-male                  
              aggression during a female's fertile period decreases the                      
              likelihood that the female's young are sired by males other than               
              her territorial partner.  2.  Female-female aggression during the              
              egg-laying period functions to decrease the likelihood that                    
              females' broods contain nestlings from other females of the same               
              species that lay their eggs in the nests of neighbors.  3.  Mate-              
              guarding by males is a response to females' behavior or                        
              ecological circumstances that increase the likelihood that                     
              females mate with more than one male.  4.  Parental feeding of                 
              nestlings by males varies according to males' likelihood of                    
              genetic paternity as indicated by the behavior of females when                 
              they are fertile.                                                              
                                                                                             
              These are important questions for several reasons.  Dr. Gowaty                 
              and her colleagues are attempting to observe evolutionary                      
              processes as they occur, by testing the current functional                     
              utility and evolutionary significance of important, sometimes                  
              dramatic, social behaviors.  Also, the researchers are testing                 
              hypotheses about the relationship of "confidence of paternity"                 
              (the perceived likelihood that a male is the actual genetic sire               
              of the offspring he cares for) to actual genetic paternity as                  
              assessed using DNA markers.  This in turn is important because                 
              ideas about confidence of paternity are theoretically prominent                
              explanations for variation in the social behavior of male                      
              animals.
