Abstract    :
              A workshop will be convened in late 1992 to bring together                     
              natural and social scientists from Latin America, Canada, and                  
              the United States to consider needs for integrated research                    
              related to the potential impacts of global change on societies                 
              and on national and regional economies.  Topics tentatively                    
              identified for discussion include: changes in land use and                     
              their impacts; coastal zone utilization and management; past                   
              environmental and social change and their linkages to past                     
              global change; and predictions of global change and their                      
              impact on societies and economies.  The workshop will permit                   
              timely identification of topics of highest priority for human                  
              dimensions research related to global change which could be                    
              incorporated into the scientific agenda of the Inter-American                  
              Institute for Global Change Research (IAI).  The Workshop is                   
              being organized under the auspices of the Human Dimensions and                 
              Global Environmental Change Program (HDGECP) and the                           
              International Geosphere-Biosphere Program (IGBP).
