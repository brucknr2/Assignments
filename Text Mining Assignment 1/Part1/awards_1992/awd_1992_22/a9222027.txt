Abstract    :
              The goal of the proposed research is to identify all the                       
              neurotrophic or neuronal cell survival factors active during                   
              development of the inner ear.  Neurotrophic factors are essential              
              for survival and development of most if not all neurons.  They have            
              thus far been studied individually relative to a given population              
              of neurons.  At this point, few studies have probed the issue of               
              whether multiple factors may be active on the same group of cells              
              either at the same time or at different time points during                     
              development.  This is a  potentially important avenue of                       
              investigation that will be pursued in the present project.  This               
              laboratory has previously shown that neurons of the inner ear can              
              respond to nerve growth factor (NGF), one member of a family of                
              neurotrophic factors.  This new project will focus on other members            
              of this family of  molecules.  The initial studies will focus on               
              when during embryonic development binding sites for the other                  
              members of the NGF family appear on the neurons of the inner ear.              
              The presence of binding sites for a molecule is necessary for a                
              nerve cell to be able to respond to that molecule.  Subsequent                 
              studies will determine when the factors themselves appear during               
              development.  Although binding sites are a prerequisite for a                  
              response, the factor itself must be present in the embryo in order             
              to elicit and effect.  This project will yield a more complete                 
              picture of the multiple influences responsible for development of              
              a neuron. ***//
