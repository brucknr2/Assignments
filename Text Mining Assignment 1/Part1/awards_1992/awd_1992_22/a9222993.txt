                  The International Congress for Anthropological and                        
              Ethnological Sciences is the largest and most important                        
              international meeting for anthropologists in the world and                     
              it is held every two years in different countries.  This                       
              project is a request for a block travel grant to support                       
              American anthropologists so they may travel to Mexico City                     
              to attend the 13th congress in July 1993.  The American                        
              Anthropological Association will administer the award by                       
              holding a competition.  Selection criteria will include                        
              quality of abstract, role of applicant in congress (e.g.,                      
              chairing a session), junior scholar status, and the                            
              applicant's ability to broadly represent American                              
              anthropology (sex, ethnicity, etc.).  Standard awards will                     
              be of $500 and are to defray the costs of travel only.
