Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                                         ABSTRACT                                            
                                                                                            
              This project will involve the extensive recording of texts from                
              speakers of Oneida with the goal of furthering understanding of                
              the phonological, syntactic, and discourse properties of prosodic              
              units previously termed "utterance" in the linguistic literature               
              on Oneida and any other prosodic constituents intermediate                     
              between the word and "utterance". The texts will be tape-                      
              recorded, transcribed and translated into English, and then                    
              subjected to instrument measurement to determine pause and                     
              intonation patterns. A completed volume of texts will include                  
              morpheme-by-morpheme analyses and glosses. The project will be                 
              carried out in close collaboration with a respected speaker and                
              teacher in the Oneida community. Such a collaboration will ensure              
              the widest variety possible in the text sample. The collection of              
              such textual material is seen as urgent, given the steady                      
              decreasing numbers of speakers of Oneida over the last two                     
              decades. It is anticipated that the text volume will benefit                   
              linguistics regardless of theoretical alignment and also                       
              community-based projects aimed at maintaining and preserving                   
              Oneida.
