Abstract    :
                    This proposal aims to study two important problems in ceramic            
              high Tc superconductor (HTCS).  They are the dynamics of flux flow             
              and effects of chemical doping.  Two major techniques will be used             
              to study both problems together in a systematic way.  These                    
              techniques are the direct flux-motion monitoring (DFMM) technique              
              and the x-ray absorption fine structure (XAFS) technique.  by a                
              combination of these two techniques, the results are expected to               
              provide information on flux dynamics and microstructures which will            
              be useful for a clear understanding and effective control of the               
              magnetic properties as well as critical current density of the high            
              transition temperature superconductors.

                    This experimental study aims to connect the phenomena of flux            
              flow/flux pinning with their microscopic causes, namely, the                   
              impurities.  Both the direct flux-motion monitoring (DFMM)                     
              technique and the x-ray absorption fine structure (XAFS) technique             
              will be used in combination for this study.  It will provide a                 
              clear understanding and effective control the magnetic properties              
              and critical current density of the ceramic high transition                    
              temperature superconductors.
