Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Normal function of the vertebrate nervous system depends on                    
              a precise pattern of distribution of the different cell                        
              types.  For example, cone photoreceptors, which constitute a                   
              sheet of light-sensitive neurons in the retina of the eye,                     
              come in three main types, each type maximally sensitive to                     
              light of a certain color, red, green or blue.  The different                   
              cone-cell types are arranged in a regular, repeating lattice                   
              or mosaic pattern.  The developmental mechanisms that build                    
              the lattice, i.e. that control the spacing and determine the                   
              fate of the presumptive cone cells, are not well understood.                   
              Most biologists agree that the immature cells send signals                     
              to their neighbors that determine the fate of the                              
              neighboring cells.  To begin to understand this process, the                   
              earliest stages in the development of the cone mosaic will                     
              be examined.  Molecular markers will used to identify the                      
              early developing cone types.  The hypothesis to be tested is                   
              that one cone type acts as the "founder"  to establish a                       
              blueprint of the mosaic pattern, and the other cone types                      
              develop later, filling in the pattern.  This study will give                   
              new insight into how the distribution of different neuron                      
              types are established and will provide new information about                   
              the way cells communicate with each other during                               
              development.
