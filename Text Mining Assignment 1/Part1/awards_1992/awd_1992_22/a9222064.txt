Abstract    :
              The general objective of the research is to develop new floor                  
              system designs for steel framed buildings that are more efficient              
              than those currently used.  This efficiency will be achieved                   
              through a combination of increased composite slab spans and framing            
              weight and development of integrated designs that incorporate                  
              structural, electrical, mechanical and communication systems in a              
              partially pre-assembled configuration.  The objectives of the                  
              research will be achieved by using an integrated approach of                   
              design, analysis and experimentation.  Potential long-span                     
              composite slab systems will be evaluated using partial-composite               
              theory, which incorporates elemental tests and a non-linear finite             
              element program.  Basic slab properties related to the interfacial             
              bond and end-anchorage strengths will be evaluated with the                    
              elemental tests.  Semi-rigid composite beam-to-girder connections              
              will be developed to reduce serviceability problems associated with            
              the use of high strength steels.
