Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  A system incorporating very large storage capacity and high               
              computational power will be developed for this project involving               
              special purpose VLSI applications.  These applications include:                
                                                                                             
              *  VLSI architectures for compression algorithms.                              
                                                                                             
              *  VLSI Algorithms for computer vision.                                        
                                                                                             
              *  VLSI Algorithms for signal processing.
