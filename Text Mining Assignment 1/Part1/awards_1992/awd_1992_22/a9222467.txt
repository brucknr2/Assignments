Abstract    :
               The approaches in computational geometry to date have  been largely theoretical
              and deal with discrete and  combinatorial structures such as point sets, lines,
              polygons,  polyhedra and at most general arrangement of hyperplanes.  This
              project considers the design and implementation of  efficient algorithms for an
              arbitrary arrangement of algebraic  curves and surfaces and specifically
              compact solids bounded by  curved algebraic surface patches.  The class of
              algebraic  surfaces, a subset of arbitrary analytic surfaces, provides  enough
              generality to accurately model almost all complex rigid  objects. 
              Additionally, algebraic curves and surfaces have  compact storage
              representation and form a class which is  complete under all common operations
              required by a geometric  modeling system.  Finally, representing physical
              objects with  algebraic surfaces encompasses all prior modeling approaches. 
              The main research thrusts of this project are:  (1) the design of efficient
              algorithms for basic operations on  algebraic surfaces (these manipulations
              include  intersection, parameterization, Ck-interpolation, and  approximation),
              and  (2) the design of efficient algorithms for basic manipulations  on solids
              bounded by algebraic surface patches (these  manipulations include: boolean set
              operations, convex hull,  decomposition, convolution, offset, blending, and
              smoothing  operations).
