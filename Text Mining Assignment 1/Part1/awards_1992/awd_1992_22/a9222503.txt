                  Abstract ATM-9223114 Henrichs, Susan University of Alaska Title: Flux and
              Fate of Sediment and Water from Small, Mountainous Rivers to the Continental
              Margin: The Gulf of Alaska Example  Small rivers charging directly from
              mountains into the ocean carry greater sediment loads than commonly envisioned,
              a relatively great percentage of which may escape to deeper waters during high
              stands of sea level.  This award supports a study of the flux of Holocene
              fluvial sediment into the Gulf of Alaska, whose generally small tributary
              rivers are collectively the largest supplier of sediment from North America. 
              Alaskan rivers are relatively uninfluenced by human activities, although
              glacial activity has resulted in higher sediment yields than noted for other
              rivers with similar drainage areas.  The investigation will employ
              high-resolution seismic profiling for the identification of sediment
              accumulation and discharge patterns on the shelf and slope, and to trace
              individual sediment layers derived from episodic (flood) events. 
              Sedimentological data will help define the escape routes/processes, and a
              variety of radiometric datings will show frequency of occurrence and rates of
              accumulation.  Measurements of total organic carbon and total nitrogen, del13C,
              del15N, and lignin will be used to determine the amount and source of organic
              matter accumulating in the sediments. Contemporaneous oceanographic processes
              controlling strata formation will also be evaluated.  This information should
              help in the interpretation of the older strata observed by seismic profiling
              and coring.
