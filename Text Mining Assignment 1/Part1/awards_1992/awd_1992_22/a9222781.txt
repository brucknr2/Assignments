Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              A fundamental investigation of epitaxial growth and analysis of the            
              properties of SiGeC will be conducted to assess the viability of               
              obtaining strain compensation in SiGe by incorporation of 1 to 2               
              atomic percent carbon into CVD-grown layers of SiGeC, and thereby              
              raise the energy band gap.  In the binary alloy, the presence of               
              about 10 atomic percent Ge in Si introduces strain and lowers the              
              energy gap; in contrast, the addition of only 1 to 2 percent carbon            
              in SiGe is expected to compensate the strain and raise the energy              
              gap. If this is feasible, and the material is thermally stable to              
              temperatures of 950C, it may be possible to fabricate a wide range             
              of structures and advanced devices through band gap engineering of             
              Si/SiGe/SiGeC heterostructures analogous to what has been                      
              successfully demonstrated with compound semiconductors, which would            
              represent an important advance in microelectronics.                            
              %%%                                                                            
              This research will investigate epitaxial crystal growth of silicon             
              germanium carbon alloys to understand basic materials properties,              
              and to assess the possibility of controlling the energy band gap of            
              Si/SiGe/SiGeC heterostructures for utilization of this material in             
              a wide range of advanced silicon-based devices.  The ternary alloy,            
              SiGeC, holds the potential of superior device and circuit                      
              capability while simplifying process integration.
