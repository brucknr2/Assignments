Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Foraging honey bees learn the locations of dozens of flower                    
              patches within a 10-kilometer radius of their nest, and perform a              
              series of body movements referred to as a "dance language" to                  
              communicate to nestmates the locations of these sites.  Memory of              
              landmarks, and of the relationship between the landscape and the               
              sun's course, plays a prominent role in these behavioral feats.                
                                                                                             
              Dr. Dyer's previous studies have clarified what bees learn about               
              the relationships among landmarks seen in different parts of                   
              their foraging range, and about the course of the sun relative to              
              the landscape.  The present project will further investigate the               
              contents of spatial memory in experienced honey bees, and will                 
              also attempt to uncover the processes whereby naive bees acquire               
              information about important spatial relationships in the                       
              environment.                                                                   
                                                                                             
              Honey bees are extremely attractive subjects for such studies                  
              because their behavior poses some intriguing problems, given the               
              enormous scale and flexibility of the bees' movements and the                  
              small size of their brain.  At the same time, the behavior is                  
              highly amenable to experimental exploration of the underlying                  
              processes.  To the extent that many other animals face                         
              navigational problems parallel to those faced by honey bees,                   
              these studies can contribute to the development of general                     
              theories about how nervous systems may be equipped to make use of              
              inevitably limited processing capacity.
