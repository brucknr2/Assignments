Abstract    :
              9222752  Greenaway  The purchase of a multi-institutional, multi-user EPR 
              spectrometer to be housed in the Department of  Chemistry at  Clark University
              will complement the Worcester Consortium  Center for Magnetic Resonance,
              located in the same building,  to  provide facilities for biological and
              chemical research  for institutions throughout Central New England.  A total of
               ten educational institutions throughout New England are  represented.    Five
              specific research projects of biomedical emphasis and  three of
              physico-chemical emphasis are proposed, as well as  a number of secondary
              projects. The major users propose  studies of:    the structure and mechanism
              of action of lysyl oxidase and  related copper-containing amine oxidases;  the
              structures and mechanisms regulating selection and  transfer of fragments of
              antigenic proteins into the antigen-  binding sites of major histocompatibility
              complex molecules;  the improvement of EPR dosimetric techniques with emphasis 
              on the use of bone marrow and bone fragments as in situ  dosimeters;  the
              cytochrome P-450 monooxygenase-mediated mechanisms of  toxicity of
              chlorocarbons;  the effects of metal-binding in the neurochemically-  important
              protein calmodulin on conformation and  interactions with intracellular target
              enzymes and inhibitor  proteins;  the low-temperature magnetic properties of
              transparent  bimetallic layered ferrimagnetic systems;  the nature of the
              radical sulfur species present in aqueous  solutions and at electrode surfaces;
               quantum effects n linear antiferromagnetic chains.
