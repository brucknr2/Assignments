Abstract    :
              9222177  Potts    The genes of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) play a
               major role in immune recognition.  Because of this, it has  generally been
              assumed that their unequalled genetic diversity  results from parasite-driven
              selection.  However, these genes may  also function in a genetic-based
              kin-recognition system.  This  possibility is indicated by Dr. Potts' recent
              demonstration that  female house mice prefer to mate with MHC-dissimilar males,
              but  prefer to nest communally with MHC-similar females.  Dr. Potts  will now
              attempt to extend these findings in two major ways.   First, discrimination in
              kin-recognition systems requires a  referent to which other individuals are
              compared.  Dr. Potts will  use MHC-based mating preferences in a seminatural
              population of  house mice as an assay to determine (1) whether self, a parent,
              a  nestmate, or some combination is the referent, and (2) the nature  of the
              rules for matching MHC haplotypes.  Second, to determine  whether or not the
              unique features of MHC (known primarily from  studies of mice) are general
              vertebrate traits, Dr. Potts will  evaluate MHC-related patterns of fitness,
              mating, and genetic  diversity in natural populations of five other vertebrate 
              species.    If MHC genes are generally involved in disease resistance, mating 
              preferences, and kin recognition in vertebrate species,  understanding the
              mechanisms and function of this MHC-based  discrimination will have important
              implications for a wide range  of areas in vertebrate biology.  These areas
              include the  evolution of immune-recognition systems, the evolution of social 
              behavior, modulation of kin-based cooperation, inbreeding-  avoidance
              mechanisms, and the genetic basis of mating behavior  and kin discrimination.
