Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The principal investigator was previously funded by NSF/ATM to                 
              initiate an experimental science education project in the Bronx                
              public school system.  The project is entitled the District Eleven             
              Weather Study Program (DEWS).  Its primary object is to demonstrate            
              that when fourth-, fifth-, and sixth-grade students are given the              
              opportunity to participate in highly-motivational activities in                
              weather study, they will acquire skills in basic scientific                    
              procedures, positive attitudes towards the study of science, and a             
              greater awareness of career opportunities in the sciences,                     
              especially in meteorology.  The DEWS program is a successful                   
              activity within the Bronx public school system and has required                
              only intermitted and nominal NSF support.  Recent events prompted              
              the principal investigator to request additional support from NSF              
              under a new proposal.  The support under thiss award will be used              
              to partially cover the increased cost of weather data received                 
              under the UNIDATA contract with Zephyr Weather Information Service,
