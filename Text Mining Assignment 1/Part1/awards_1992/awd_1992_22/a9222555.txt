Abstract    :
              The Organization for Tropical Studies, Inc., a consortium and                  
              Costa Rican universities and research institutions, has operated               
              the La Selva Biological Stations in the Atlantic rainforest of                 
              Cost Rica since 1968.  This project will provide the critically                
              important operational support for one of the world's premier                   
              research and training sites in the wet tropics.  High quality                  
              laboratories and infrastructure, a state-of-the-art Geographic                 
              Information/Database System, spectacular biodiversity, and a                   
              welcoming host country have all contributed to La Selva's                      
              dramatic growth and success.  Over 230 researchers and more than               
              50 university courses now use the station annually.  La Selva                  
              serves an unusually broad segment of the U.S. academic community,              
              is playing an increasingly important role in the development of                
              science in Latin America, and has become a world center for the                
              study of tropical rain forests and their associated altered                    
              ecosystems.  As such, the station is a valuable element of the                 
              United States' programs on biodiversity, global change and                     
              international science.
