Abstract    :
              These funds provide technical and administrative support of                    
              activities of the Committee on Interagency Radiation Research and              
              Policy Coordination (CIRRPC), a subcommittee of the Committee on               
              Life Sciences and Health, which is part of the Federal Coordinating            
              Council for Science, Engineering and Technology (FCCSET).  Sources             
              of radiation (ionizing and nonionizing) affect all Americans, play             
              a significant role in many scientific and technological segments of            
              American society, and are ubiquitous in our natural environment.               
              The Director of the Office and Science and Technology Policy                   
              (OSTP), who is also the Chairman for FCCSET signed the Charter                 
              creating the CIRRPC in 1984. CIRRPC complements the radiation                  
              research and policy activities of the 18 federal member agencies.              
              Each agency contributes financial support to the operations of                 
              CIRRPC.                                                                        
              %%%                                                                            
              Current activities of CIRRPC include review of the literature on               
              the possible health risks to humans from exposure to low-frequency             
              electric and magnetic fields and coordination of radiation risk                
              assessments and the review of radiation protection standards.
