Abstract    :
              This research project, supported in the Analytical and Surface                 
              Chemistry Program, explores the detailed kinetics of                           
              hydrocarbon species on well characterized transition metal                     
              surfaces.  The work focusses on the development of methods for                 
              preparing hydrocarbon intermediates cleanly on the surface                     
              using a low energy ion source, on improving the sensitivity for                
              monitoring surface kinetics in these systems, and on carrying                  
              out careful isothermal kinetic measurements of the reactions of                
              these adsorbed intermediates.  The chemistry to be explored                    
              includes the isolation and reaction of intermediates such as                   
              alklyidene, vinyl, and allyl on platinum, copper and nickel                    
              surfaces.                                                                      
              %%%                                                                            
              The understanding of the detailed chemistry of the                             
              intermediates produced when hydrocarbon molecules interact with                
              transition metal surfaces is important for understanding                       
              heterogeneous catalysis.  This research project develops                       
              methods and approaches for identifying and detailing the                       
              kinetics of adsorbed hydrocarbon intermediates on such                         
              catalytically important metals as platinum, nickel and copper.                 
              The kinetic information obtained from these studies will be                    
              useful for our developing understanding of the reactivity and                  
              selectivity of transition metal catalysts.
