Abstract    :
                   This award supports studies of long-term (Pleistocene and                 
              Cenozoic) climate change aimed at developing a plausible physical              
              model to account for the simultaneous time-evolution of many                   
              climatic variables (e.g., ice mass, CO2, ocean state and surface               
              temperature and their spatial distributions).  The studies involve             
              statistical analyses of the relevant time-series records as well as            
              theoretical studies based on both "deductive" physics (using                   
              general circulation models and statistical-dynamical models) and               
              "inductive" low-order models (using qualitative physics, structured            
              by the theory of dynamical systems analysis).  This work will                  
              enlarge upon our present theory of Pliocene/Pleistocene climatic               
              evolution by (a) extension to Pre-Pliocene changes, (b) extension              
              to a two-dimensional geography, (c) incorporation of explicit ocean            
              dynamics, (d) explicit treatment of the continental biosphere, and             
              (e) establishing closure relations between the fast and slow                   
              response variables by systematic GCM studies.
