Abstract    :
              9222684  Lavery       The Board on Mathematical Sciences (BMS) and the Board  on
              Chemical Sciences and Technology (BCST) of the Commission  on Physical
              Sciences, Mathematics and Applications (CPSMA),  National Research Council
              (NRC) will conduct a study that  will identify research opportunities for the
              mathematical  sciences, appropriate for both collaborative work will  chemical
              scientists and for independent work, relevant to  computational chemistry.  The
              primary goal of the study is  to engage the talent of more mathematical
              scientists to work  on problems in computational chemistry, which should
              produce  advances of benefit to both the mathematical and chemical  sciences. 
              This study will produce a report, written in  language accessible to both
              chemical and mathematical  scientists, that presents a number of open problems
              in  computational chemistry that have mathematical components,  to give
              mathematical scientists sufficient background for  initiating relevant research
              either independently or in  collaboration with chemical scientists.  The report
              will  also identify some of the intellectual and administrative  barriers that
              often hinder crossdisciplinary research  related to computational chemistry,
              and make recommendations  to the research communities, policymakers, and
              federal  funding agencies on how to overcome or minimize these  barriers.
