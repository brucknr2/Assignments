Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                                                                                             
                  This  project represents a  joint research program                        
              between the Dr. Len Muscatine of UCLA and Dr. Karl Va. Bil',                   
              Head of the Photobiotechnology Department, Institute  of                       
              Soil Science and Photosynthesis, Russian Academy of Science.                   
              The research will determine the path of carbon flow produced                   
              in photosynthesis of symbiotic dinoflagellates (known as,                      
              zooxanthellae) in sea anemones and corals and how this                         
              pathway is altered by a host factor which induces the algal                    
              cells to release glycerol.  Host factor is now obtained in                     
              pure form in Muscatine's laboratory.  The path of carbon                       
              will initially be determined in zooxanthellae in vitro using                   
              classical  C-14 labeling and short-term photosynthesis                         
              techniques of Calvin and Benson.  In companion experiments,                    
              the researchers  will concurrently introduce cnidarian host                    
              factor and attempt to detect changes in the pathway which it                   
              induces.  From the data obtained, including analysis of key                    
              enzyme activities, a testable hypothesis on the mechanism of                   
              action of host factor on the reductive pentose phosphate                       
              pathway and glycerol synthesis will be formulated and                          
              tested.
