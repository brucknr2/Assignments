Abstract    :
              

Mr. Michael Kucher, under the direction of Drs. David Hounshell and Lawrence
              Duggan, is examining an engineering community and its work in one city --
              Siena, Italy.  He is using an ecological and hydrological perspective to frame
              a multi-faceted discussion of urban uses of water and their impact upon the
              "built" and natural environments.  He is further attempting to assess the
              formation of an engineering community responsible for building this            
                           infrastructure, the sources of its technical knowledge, and the
              training of its members.  This requires focussing upon the engineering
              community's role in design and construction of a state-of-the-art system for
              the supply and distribution of water during a period of rapid demographic and
              economic expansion.  He is also examining how the technological innovations
              developed in this context were diffused to other cities in the region and
              across Europe.  This study promises significant contributions to our
              understanding of the development of cities, large-scale technological systems,
              and the diffusion of technical knowledge  across cultural frontiers.
