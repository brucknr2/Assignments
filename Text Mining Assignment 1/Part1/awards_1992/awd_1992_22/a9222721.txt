Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  Many anthropologists have suggested that carnivores played                
              an important role in human evolution, as predators, competitors,               
              and carcass providers.  However, the details of these                          
              relationships remain fuzzy, largely because of a dearth of                     
              quantitative work on the ecological adaptations of the extinct                 
              carnivores.                                                                    
                                                                                             
                   This research in the functional morphology and guild                      
              structure  of large bodied carnivores  will greatly improve the                
              quality of our inferences concerning hominid-carnivore                         
              interactions in the African Plio-Pleistocene.  The graduate                    
              student will test hypotheses concerning critical behaviors of the              
              predators, such as their ability to cache prey in trees, kill                  
              large prey, and scavenge from kills.  It is significant to                     
              hominid evolutionary studies because it will fill in significant               
              information on the paleoecology of our ancestors.
