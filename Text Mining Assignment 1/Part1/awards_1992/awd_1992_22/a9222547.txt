Abstract    :
              Professor Pearson is comparing the relative status of African-                 
              American and White doctoral chemists in the American scientific                
              community.  Previous studies of the career patterns of American                
              chemists have not included racial status.  This research seeks to              
              contribute to this literature by examining the participation of                
              African-Americans in chemistry.                                                
                                                                                             
              Professor Pearson is examining the career patterns of all African-             
              Americans known to have earned chemistry doctorates.  He and his               
              student assistants are collecting data by means of a mailed                    
              questionnaire and personal interviews.  The control group is                   
              comprised of White chemists matched on four criteria:  (1)  Ph.D.-             
              granting department, (2) sex, (3) thesis advisor (where possible),             
              and (4) research specialty.                                                    
                                                                                             
              Professor Pearson is analyzing the data by means of bivariate and              
              multivariate statistics.  Because much of the existing knowledge of            
              the role of race in science in general and chemistry in particular             
              is unsystematic and anecdotal, the results of the study will                   
              advance our knowledge of the career patterns of African-American               
              doctoral scientists.  The results should provide data that permit              
              scholars to revise our understanding the experiences of African-               
              American chemists vis-a-vis their white counterparts.  While this              
              history cannot correct past wrongs, it can point the way to                    
              avoiding those mistakes in the future.  And to the extent that                 
              recent policy has ameliorated past wrongs, the study should help to            
              assess what works and does not work in the effort to create true               
              equal opportunity within science.
