Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              How do we construct maps of the real world in our brain?                       
              Apparently there is a structure called the hippocampus that                    
              contains a spatial map that is laid down through experience.  Dr.              
              Walsh has devised a novel behavioral test to assess how various                
              chemical inputs affect the behavioral function of this structure.              
              With this NSF grant he will manipulate the chemical environment of             
              the cells that provide major inputs to the hippocampus.  By                    
              measuring the number and types of errors made in a spatial maze                
              after each manipulation he will be able to determine whether his               
              chemical manipulations have improved or interfered with hippocampal            
              function.  The results of these experiments will improve our                   
              understanding of the neurobiological foundations of learning and               
              memory.  The future applications will include drugs that can be                
              used to improve memory or, alternatively, reduce the influence of              
              unwanted, intrusive memories.***//
