Abstract    :
                   This project will study the feasibility of fabricating                    
              microelectronic devices from boron and boron carbide-based                     
              materials.  The research is based on initial success in the                    
              selective area deposition of boron and boron carbide by chemical               
              vapor deposition, using boranes.  A number of electronic devices               
              and electronic grade protective coatings will be fabricated by                 
              using x-ray lithographic techniques.                                           
                   Boron carbide-based semiconductor devices may be of                       
              considerable interest, due to their potential high temperature and             
              radiation-resistant properties.  As a result, such devices may work            
              under extreme conditions.
