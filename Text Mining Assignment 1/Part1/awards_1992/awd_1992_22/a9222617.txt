Abstract    :
              This award in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic                  
              Program provides support to Dr. Cynthia K. Schauer of the                      
              Chemistry Department, University of North Carolina at Chapel                   
              Hill, for synthesis of linear oligomers of small                               
              metal-phosphorus clusters.  The clusters generally contain five                
              atom frameworks of iron and phosphorus with carbonyl ligands.                  
              A variety of synthetic strategies will be used to form metal                   
              bridged, phosphorus-phosphorus bridged, and organic group                      
              bridged chains.  The reactions take advantage of the reactivity                
              at the phosphorus atom when hydrogen or trialkylsilyl groups                   
              are removed from that site.  The properties and reactivities of                
              the resulting oligomers will be investigated, with the goal of                 
              providing models for the reactivity of polymeric chains.                       
              Synthesis of longer chained species or chains containing                       
              phosphorus cubanes will also be attempted.                                     
              %%%                                                                            
              This study attempts to find synthetic procedures for the                       
              construction of linear chains containing phosphorus and metals.                
              The project is a synthetic challenge and is of fundamental                     
              interest.  Utility may lie in the extent to which shorter                      
              chain, and therefore more easily characterized, molecules                      
              reveal the properties of longer chain polymers built from the                  
              same connecting units.  It is possible that these compounds or                 
              their analogues may have interesting electronic properties.
