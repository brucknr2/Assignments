Abstract    :
                   Eight 4-processor compute engines, a central monitor                      
              workstation and associated hardware shall be aquired and used in a             
              specially developed 32- processor multicomputer including custom               
              hybrid instrumentation and performance monitoring features which               
              will be dedicated to support several research projects.  These                 
              include:                                                                       
                                                                                             
              *  Active Memory Hierarchy (AMH) Architecture and Software                     
              Development.                                                                   
                                                                                             
              *  Portable Performance Monitoring.                                            
                                                                                             
              *  Portable Parallel Programming Environment.                                  
                                                                                             
              *  Parallel Algorithm Development.                                             
                                                                                             
              *  Low Latency Multicomputer Interconnection Network.                          
                                                                                             
              These interdisciplinary projects bring together faculty and                    
              students from Aerospace Engineering, Electrical and Computer                   
              Engineering, Computational Engineering and Computer Science with a             
              common purpose of accelerating CFS applications.  The                          
              instrumentation will provide a common platform or hub around which             
              key research issues involving performance optimization, parallel               
              system instrumentation and monitoring, parallel algorithm and                  
              program design and parallel programming environments can be                    
              synergistically pursued.
