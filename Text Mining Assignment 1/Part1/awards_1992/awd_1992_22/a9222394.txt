Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                                         ABSTRACT                                            
                                                                                             
                                                                                             
                  The linguistic expression of spatial relations is central to              
              recent work in semantics, cognitive anthropology, and language                 
              acquisition. Universalist claims have been advanced about the                  
              nature of linguistically coded spatial concepts, their origins in              
              human perception and cognition, and their order of acquisition.                
              There are, however, few studies of spatial language in non-                    
              European contexts, and even fewer studies of the use of spatial                
              language in ordinary life. This projects investigates three                    
              spatial domains in Zinacantec Tzotzil (Mayan, Chiapas, Mexico)                 
              which challenge current typological claims: (1) verbs of motion;               
              (2) positional roots involving "support" and "containment"; and                
              (3) inalienably possessed nominal roots encoding "anatomical"                  
              spatial relations. Extending existing studies of spatial                       
              semantics in adult Tzotzil, this project investigates the use of               
              elements from these linguistic subdomains in both natural and                  
              semi-natural contexts: in everyday work, and in constructed                    
              interactive "space games". The project also explores the                       
              Zinacantec child's acquisition of the structure and use of these               
              lexical systems, cross-sectionally and longitudinally. The                     
              project will elucidate, first mutual relationships between                     
              semantic systems and the indexical structure of specific cultural              
              communicative practices. Second, it will reveal possible                       
              interactions between the acquisition of spatial concepts and                   
              language-specific systems of spatial representation.
