Abstract    :
              This award in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic                  
              Program provides continued support to Dr. Louis H. Pignolet of                 
              the Chemistry Department, University of Minnesota, for the                     
              investigation of mixed metal cluster compounds containing gold,                
              platinum, and palladium.  Pignolet will synthesize additional                  
              cluster molecules that are larger, contain a wider variety of                  
              metals, and use less bulky phosphine ligands.  Recently,                       
              Pignolet has observed that hydrogen molecules can equilibrate                  
              with deuterium molecules on the surface of these clusters.  He                 
              wishes to explore the mechanism of this interaction and                        
              characterize the species involved.  He would also study the                    
              catalytic activity of these clusters upon hydrogenation under                  
              both homogeneous and heterogeneous conditions.  The catalyst                   
              systems would be characterized using TEM, XPS, chemisorption                   
              and other surface methods.                                                     
              %%%                                                                            
              Many industrial catalysts contain a mixture of metals, and it                  
              is speculated that the effectiveness of these catalysts depends                
              on a synergistic interaction between the various metals.  Mixed                
              metal clusters, containing eight to twenty metal atoms, have                   
              been postulated as useful model compounds for understanding the                
              details of such catalytic activity.  In this project, Pignolet                 
              will make larger and more varied clusters and reduce the size                  
              of the stabilizing phosphine groups attached to the metals so                  
              as to enhance the cluster's catalytic effectiveness.  The                      
              catalytic behavior of the clusters will be investigated,                       
              particularly for hydrogenation catalysis, and both free and                    
              alumina-supported clusters will be studied.  The results could                 
              provide increased understanding of the factors affecting the                   
              reactivity of catalysts.
