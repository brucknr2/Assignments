Abstract    :
                   Improved understanding of the solar activity cycle and of its             
              effects upon solar outputs requires, first and foremost, more                  
              information on its past behavior. This grant is for the completion             
              of one aspect of the RISE (Radiative Inputs of the Sun to Earth)               
              program, to digitize and reduce the CaK spectroheliograms obtained             
              on a daily basis between 1915 and 1985 at Mt. Wilson. These images             
              provide by far the longest record of solar chromospheric plages. We            
              also plan to analyze the behavior of these structures in active                
              regions and in the network over the past 7 solar cycles, for                   
              information on variations of solar UV, EUV and total irradiances.              
              The behavior of facular area, spatial distribution, and brightness             
              will also provide information on the sun's magnetic fields and                 
              activity levels that is complementary to data obtained by the                  
              sunspot index, and from other much shorter data bases such as                  
              magnetograms. The data from this grant will be made available to               
              the scientific community. The results of this project should be of             
              considerable interest to the upper atmospheric physicists,                     
              climatologists and in ongoing efforts to improve prediction and                
              dynamical understanding of solar activity cycles.
