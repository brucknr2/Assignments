Abstract    :
              The 5th International Symposium on Meson-Nucleon Physics and the               
              Structure of the Nucleon will be held.  Currently, there is great              
              interest worldwide in this topic.  Experts will gather to assess               
              the experimental and theoretical status of the field and discuss               
              future plans.  Strong international participation is expected.
