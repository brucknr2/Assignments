Abstract    :
              The nervous system is composed of numerous cell types.  The                    
              mechanisms that control development of the different cell types are            
              poorly understood.  It is clear that a complex array of signals                
              sent between the developing cells are essential.  One type of                  
              signal is communicated through direct contact between the surface              
              protein that influences the final stages of maturation of one cell             
              type, the neuroglial cells.  The current project will examine in               
              more detail the role and mode of action of this protein in cultured            
              retinal cells.  Artificial genes will be constructed and introduced            
              into the retinal cells.  These artificial gene constructs will                 
              block normal expression of the protein in the retinal cells, thus              
              allowing the investigators to directly observe the role of this                
              molecule in specific developmental events.  The protein being                  
              studied is one member of a large family of proteins, and one or                
              more members of this family are present on most if not all cells of            
              the developing nervous system.  Insights gained as to the function             
              of one member of this protein family will supply a better                      
              understanding of mechanisms active in development of all nervous               
              system cells.***//
