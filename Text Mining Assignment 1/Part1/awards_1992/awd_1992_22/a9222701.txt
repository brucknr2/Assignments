Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Ms. Ann S. Oliver's dissertation research is a comparative field               
              study of behavioral endocrinology in two species of fish that are              
              simultaneous hermaphrodites.  Spawning behavior depends upon size              
              in one species, which is serially monogamous, and upon social                  
              status in the other species, which is permanently monogamous.                  
              The objective of this project is to complete hormone analysis                  
              necessary to test three hypotheses about the relationships                     
              between behaviors and the absolute levels and relative                         
              concentrations of circulating steroid hormones.  Comparison of                 
              hormonal correlates of behavior in two species will allow                      
              generalizations about the influence of steroid hormones on                     
              hermaphrodite mating behavior.  Analysis of the relationship                   
              among aggression, androgens, and size or social status will                    
              clarify the complex interaction of social and physiological                    
              factors regulating hermaphrodite mating systems.  Timing and                   
              duration of hormone surges will be compared between species to                 
              examine physiological influences on the daily pattern of egg                   
              maturation and time of spawning.  Ms. Oliver's physiological data              
              will provide the basis for future hormone manipulations critical               
              for testing theoretical concepts about the evolution and                       
              maintenance of hermaphroditism as a stable reproductive strategy.
