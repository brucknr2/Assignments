Abstract    :
              This Phase II SBIR grant will allow BIOTEK to do research on                   
              low molecular weight metal polymer salts that can be used as                   
              biodegradable implants or injections.  Many medical                            
              therapies can benefit from drug delivery using biodegradable                   
              implants or injections.  The FDA-approved polymers used for                    
              this purpose are polyesters of lactic and glycolic acids                       
              (PLGs) which are limited to rather slow degradation in the                     
              body.  PLGs with a molecular weight low enough to degrade                      
              quickly are syrups or sticky solids. BIOTEK is seeking to                      
              improve PLGs by using low molecular weight metal polymers                      
              salts that have both good physical properties and shortened                    
              degradation times.  Phase I confirmed that such salts can be                   
              strong and non-tacky.  These new materials open the door to                    
              many new medical products; the company's commercial interest                   
              lie chiefly in producing PLG salts for the drug delivery                       
              field.  In Phase II BIOTEK will investigate alternative                        
              methods of production; verify reproducibility and purity;                      
              prepare injectable and implantable drug delivery systems;                      
              and assess delivery, irritation, and resorption                                
              characteristics.
