Abstract    :
              This award provides support for a conference with                              
              representatives from academia, industry and national                           
              laboratories to examine emerging separations processes for the                 
              mining, minerals and fuels industries.  The program encompasses                
              a wide spectrum of approaches from membranes and solvent                       
              extraction to separation methods based on molecular recognition                
              or biotechnology.                                                              
                                                                                             
              The meeting will help to make American firms more globally                     
              competitive and is timely with the present focus on renewing the               
              industrial and civil infrastructure.  Broad impact is expected                 
              with potential benefit to several industrial sectors and the                   
              general public through addressing environmental processin                      
              problems.
