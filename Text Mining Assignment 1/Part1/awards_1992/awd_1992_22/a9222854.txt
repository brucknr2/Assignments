Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              In the preparation of superconducting powder (Tc = 110 K) in                   
              the Bi-system, the precursor superconducting powder (Tc = 80                   
              K) has similar composition and physical properties as the 110                  
              K phase.  The objective of this project is the separation of                   
              the 110 K phase powder after a significant fraction of it is                   
              formed.  Considering that there is no significant difference                   
              in the physical properties (e.g. density, electrical and                       
              magnetic characteristics) of the                                               
              80 K phase and the 110 K phase, separation techniques based on                 
              differences in such properties can be ruled out.  In this                      
              study, aqueous biphase formation technique and selective                       
              flocculation technology will be examined to separate the 110 K                 
              phase from the 80 K phase.  Preferential fractionation of 110                  
              K (or 80 K) phase in the polymer rich (or aqueous phase) will                  
              be achieved using dextran, cellulose and other synthetic                       
              polymers.  Separation of the two phases by the selective                       
              flocculation technology would also involve preferential                        
              interaction between a given particle phase and polymer.  The                   
              polymer examined would include, polyacrylamides, polyacrylic                   
              acid and polyethylene oxide.                                                   
                                                                                             
              It is expected that the fundamental knowledge base generated                   
              in this study would be used in the processing of                               
              superconducting powders, as well as other applications related                 
              to materials production and environment.
