Abstract    :
              9222572  Terry Baker      This is an exploitation of carbon filaments as a
              catalyst support medium.  Catalytically grown carbon filaments have attributes
              both of active carbon and of graphite; they have high surface area but are an
              ordered array of graphitic microcrystals with a high density of active edge
              sites.  In this effort, attention is focussed on the catalytic behavior of
              platinum or iron particles supported on carbon filaments and on the catalytic
              properties of the carbon filaments themselves.  Specific issues under
              investigation include the use of oxidation treatments to increase the surface
              areas of the filaments; methods of introducing platinum or iron particles onto
              the surface; structural and chemical changes of supported particles under
              various reaction conditions; and comparisons of the catalytic activities of
              carbon-filament-supported metal particles with those of particles on
              conventional support media.  A combination of techniques is employed including
              controlled-atmosphere electron microscopy, in-situ electron diffraction,
              thermogravimetry, chemisorption, temperature-programmed desorption, and
              flow-reactor studies.    The high-surface-area carbon filaments may have
              applications and advantages in a number of industrial and pollution control
              situations as catalysts, catalyst supports, or separations (adsorption) agents.
               This is a high-risk investigation.
