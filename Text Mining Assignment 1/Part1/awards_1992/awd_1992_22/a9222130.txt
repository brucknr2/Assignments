Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The research to be carried out is based on radio                               
              spectroscopy of the gas in galaxies and is aimed at                            
              extending the Tully-Fisher relationship to determine the                       
              distance to galaxies, and to use this information to study                     
              the departures from the Hubble flow around the rich cluster                    
              cores of superclusters.  This will enable one to determine                     
              the dynamics of cluster formation.                                             
                                                                                             
              Observations will also be made of absorption of the 21-cm                      
              line through the Magellanic Clouds in order to determine                       
              certain physical characteristics of the gas in these                           
              objects.
