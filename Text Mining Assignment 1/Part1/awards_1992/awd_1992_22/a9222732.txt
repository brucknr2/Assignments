Abstract    :
                   Two force control robots with interfaces and floating point               
              accelerators will be obtained for use in projects dealing with                 
              coordination of mobile manipulators.  In particular, for:                      
                                                                                             
              *  Environment exploration force and motion control.                           
                                                                                             
              *  Locomotion and manipulation coordination.                                   
                                                                                             
              *  Multiple mobile manipulator coordination.                                   
                                                                                             
              These two compact six degree-of-freedom manipulators will be                   
              mounted on existing mobile platforms so that mobile coordination               
              may be examined.
