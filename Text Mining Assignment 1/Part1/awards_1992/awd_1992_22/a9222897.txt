Abstract    :
                   This Small Business Innovation Research Program Phase II                  
              research is to design and build a functional prototype of a fully              
              portable Computer-Aided Instrument Design (CAID) and is preparatory            
              to full-scale development of a table product use in design and test            
              of fully portable digital signal processing (DSP) instrumentation.             
                   The CAID system will have: 1) the software environment for                
              design of portable DSP instruments; and 2) a Functional-                       
              Programmable Instrument (FPI) platform, which embodies these                   
              instruments.  The CAID software integrates instrumentation, DSP,               
              and real-time aspects of signal processing instruments.  FPI                   
              consists of uncommitted instrumentation/DSP hardware blocks and                
              software functions.
