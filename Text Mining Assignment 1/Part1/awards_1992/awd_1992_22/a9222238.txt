Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This award provides supplemental funding to                                    
              EAR 9204563 for the collaborative study with                                   
              Chinese scientists of high-grade metamorphic                                   
              rocks in central China.  The objectives are to                                 
              map several metamorphic belts, to study the                                    
              mineralogy of the high pressure rocks there, to                                
              delineate mineral parageneses and to establish                                 
              geologic ages for several critical rock units.                                 
              The study will lead to a better understanding                                  
              of how continental crust was subjected to                                      
              mantle depths, and later exhumed.
