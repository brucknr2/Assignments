Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  A special configuration of high performance workstations will             
              be acquired with peripheral equipment and supporting software in               
              order to enhance collaborative problem solving environments.  The              
              selected projects to which this equipment shall be dedicated                   
              include.                                                                       
                                                                                             
              *  Extension of small group R&D environments.
