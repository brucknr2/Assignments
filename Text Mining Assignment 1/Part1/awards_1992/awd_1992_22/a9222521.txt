Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This award provides partial travel support for young United                    
              States scientists to attend the XXIII International Ethological                
              Conference (IEC), to be held in Torremolinos, Spain, 1-9                       
              September 1993.  The IEC is open to all who are interested in                  
              ethology (the biological study of behavior) and its related                    
              disciplines.  The IEC is the only international gathering in the               
              field of ethology that brings together scientists studying all                 
              aspects of animal behavior, including mechanisms, development,                 
              evolution, and function (behavioral ecology).  The biennial                    
              conference attracts scientists from over 40 nations and covers a               
              multitude of disciplines including ethology, comparative                       
              psychology, ecology, evolution, neurobiology, sociology,                       
              anthropology, psychobiology, animal science, conservation,                     
              primatology, and human ethology.  The opportunity to meet                      
              colleagues in all of these disciplines, from all over the world,               
              fosters new collaborations, new methods and approaches, and a                  
              broader perspective on the field.  These are lasting benefits to               
              the young scientists who attend and to the scientific community                
              of the United States.
