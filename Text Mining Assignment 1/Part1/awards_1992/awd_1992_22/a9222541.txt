Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The nature of the superconducting vortex lattice in high-Tc                    
              materials will be investigated by a new experimental approach based            
              on scanning probe microscopies. Low-temperature magnetic force and             
              scanning tunneling microscopes will be construed to provide direst             
              imaging of the superconducting flux-line lattice in a wide range of            
              materials of scientific and technological importance. The technique            
              will potentially yield direct imaging of structure and properties              
              of the flux lattice, including two- and three-dimensional melting,             
              glassy behavior, correlated motion, and other topics of modern                 
              condensed matter physics.                                                      
              %%%                                                                            
              The behavior of superconductors in magnetic fields is of great                 
              scientific and technological importance. Understanding the physics             
              of these materials will aid in designing new materials capable of              
              carrying large currents which will enable major new technologies,              
              devices, motors, etc. The properties of the superconductors are                
              being investigated by a novel microscope capable of imaging the                
              magnetic fields in the superconductors. This information is not                
              available by other techniques and will provide new knowledge about             
              the factors that determine the current carrying capabilities of the            
              materials.
