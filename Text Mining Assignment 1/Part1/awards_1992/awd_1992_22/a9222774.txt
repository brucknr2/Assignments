Abstract    :
                9222774  Atema      The way in which sensory receptors process rapid changes
              of  stimulus over time has not been studied much in chemical reception  (smell
              and taste), where the emphasis has been on molecular  recognition.  Yet complex
              and dynamic odors characterize the  natural environment, and are likely to be
              very important to how the  brain integrates chemosensory signals into
              appropriate behavior.   This work develops novel electrochemical measuring
              techniques for  investigating the spatial and temporal resolution of olfactory 
              receptors on the very accessible model system of the antenna of  marine
              crustaceans.  A new tightly-controlled stimulus delivery  technology allows a
              variety of stimulus parameters to be used while  measuring the magnitude and
              reliability of response parameters,  looking at effects such as excitation and
              adaptation patterns.  The  data will be incorporated into a model of
              chemosensory dynamics,  and extended in studies on receptor development and
              central coding.   This work will have impact beyond chemosensory neurobiology
              into  areas of diagnostic tests for smell and taste performance for the  food
              industry as well as medicine, and to the potential  biotechnological
              development of underwater chemosensing robotic  devices for ecology and for
              fisheries exploitation.   ***
