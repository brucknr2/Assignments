Abstract    :
              The Iceland Database Project Two is an expansion of a PC-machine-              
              readable database using the Icelandic National Archives. To                    
              previous files of vital events and census records will be added                
              farm registers, tax, probate and mortgage data. The goal is to                 
              reconstruct histories before 1871 based on the linkage of records              
              of individuals, households, families, famine survivorship and                  
              women's reproductive histories. These findings will be correlated              
              with population, climate change, the technology of food production             
              and the beginnings of modernization in mid-nineteenth century                  
              Iceland.  The project will contribute in a major way to our                    
              understanding of population and economic dynamics under arctic                 
              conditions.
