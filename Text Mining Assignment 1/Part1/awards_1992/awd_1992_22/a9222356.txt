Abstract    :
                   This award provides funding to New Jersey Institute of                    
              Technology's Industry/University Cooperative Research Center for               
              Hazardous Substance Management, for a project titled "Creation of              
              an Industry/University Cooperative Research Centers' Center                    
              Director's Handbook."  Currently the only document available to                
              I/UCRC directors which provides operational guidance is a 10-year              
              old, 27 page document that only addresses three aspects of center              
              operations.  The Committee of Visitors, which recently reviewed                
              the I/UCRC program, recommended that this document be revised.                 
              The new handbook, to be produced under this award, will codify                 
              and document the collective managerial knowledge acquired by                   
              I/UCRC participants and translate this knowledge into operational              
              "art and science" so that it can be communicated more efficiently              
              and effectively to Center directors.  The authors, Dr. George                  
              Walters and Dr. Dennis Gray, propose to research, develop and                  
              produce such a Handbook for I/UCRC Center Directors which                      
              incorporates the experience and wisdom possessed by a variety of               
              individuals such as NSF staff, Center Directors, and Evaluators                
              associated with the I/UCRC program throughout the history of the               
              program.  The Handbook will contain the following elements: 1)                 
              introduction; 2) recommended policies, procedures, and/or                      
              practices for an I/UCRC; and 3) appendices.                                    
                   The Program Director recommends that New Jersey Institute of              
              Technology be awarded $68,000, for 18 months, to undertake and                 
              complete the I/UCRC Center Directors Handbook.
