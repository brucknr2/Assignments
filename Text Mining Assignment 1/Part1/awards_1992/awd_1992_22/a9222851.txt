Abstract    :
              This proposal is for block travel grant to make a

              Expert Systems Applications to Power Systems                                   
              (ESAPS) possible.  This international meeting is a                             
              excellent vehicle for the dissemination and                                    
              exchange of information on this emerging and                                   
              important area.  Participation by key researchers                              
              from around the world is expected.  An effort will                             
              be made to augment NSF funds with industry funds
