Abstract    :
              This project is in the general area of analytical and surface                  
              chemistry and in the subfield of electrochemistry.  During the                 
              tenure of this three-year continuing grant, Professor Murray and               
              his students will pursue studies in (1) the dynamics of electron               
              self-exchange reactions and electron transfer cross-reactions in               
              polymeric phases and at their interfaces; (2) the diffusion                    
              dynamics of redox solutes and of redox-labeled polymers within                 
              polymeric phases; (3) the design and synthesis of new redox                    
              polymers and mixed valent polymer phases; and (4) the electron                 
              transfer chemistry of selected redox proteins.  The polymer phase              
              experiments involve polymer melts and glasses rather than the more             
              conventional monomeric fluid solvents.

              This research will lead to the design of new electrochemically                 
              based measurement tactics for obtaining data useful in                         
              understanding the fundamental principles involved in electron                  
              transfer and mass transport dynamics.  Also, it should lead to new             
              classes of redox polymer electrolytes and new insights into their              
              physical chemistry that will enable their effective utilization in             
              novel electrochemical sensor technology.
