              Dr. P. Paramasivam, Department of Civil                                        
              Engineering, National University of Singapore,                                 
              a workshop on the durability of concrete with                                  
              particular emphasis on the marine environment.                                 
              Nine U.S. participants and at least an equal                                   
              number from Singapore, Malaysia, Indonesia, and                                
              Brunei will be selected by an advisory panel of                                
              experts in the field of the workshop.  This                                    
              workshop is a satellite conference for the 4th                                 
              International Conference on Structural Failure,                                
              Durability, and Retrofitting which will be held                                
              in Singapore, July 14 and 15, 1993.                                            
              The magnitude of the durability problem is                                     
              considerable.  In the concrete infrastructure                                  
              estimated at $6 trillion, current replacement                                  
              and repair requirements caused by inadequate                                   
              durability is conservatively estimated at                                      
              several billion dollars.  The workshop will                                    
              focus on the use of new supplementary cementing                                
              materials, corrosion inhibitors, improved mix                                  
              design, rebar types, and construction                                          
              techniques.  The collaborators are well known                                  
              researchers in this field.
