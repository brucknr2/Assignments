Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  An integrated system consisting of a mobile robot, high-speed             
              image processing hardware, and a real-time operating system will be            
              purchased and used in several robotics research projects.  These               
              include:                                                                       
                                                                                             
              *  Visual motion for robot guidance                                            
                                                                                             
              *  Autonomous agent behavior specification and analysis.                       
                                                                                             
              *  Agent construction using discrete event dynamic systems.                    
                                                                                             
              This system will permit closed loop control methods and aid in                 
              validation and techniques involving active camera control.
