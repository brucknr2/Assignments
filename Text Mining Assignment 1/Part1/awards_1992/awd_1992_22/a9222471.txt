Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Description:  This project provides for                                        
              participation of a Pakistani                                                   
              young scientist, Ms. A Mateen, in an ongoing                                   
              research project being conducted at Oakland                                    
              University.  The research aims at the study of                                 
              the metabolism and degradation of carbofuran, a                                
              potentially toxic compound common to many                                      
              pesticides.  The study will be assisted by the                                 
              development of several mutant derivatives of                                   
              Pseudomonas sp. (P.sp.), itself a carbofuran                                   
              degrading bacterium, which have been developed                                 
              but which do not metabolize the same compound.                                 
              The study will: First, characterize the mutants                                
              of P.sp.50432, by localization of the mutations                                
              and the mutant genes, and identification of the                                
              degrative gene product.  Second, develop gene                                  
              transfer techniques and vector systems for                                     
              genetic manipulation in P.sp. 50432 by                                         
              development of techniques such as                                              
              transformation, conjugation and                                                
              electroporation, and construction of cloning                                   
              and expression vectors capable of replicating                                  
              in both E. coli and P.sp. 50432.  The project                                  
              includes a visit by the U.S. P.I. to Pakistan                                  
              to work with Ms. Mateen on a local research                                    
              program dealing with biodegradation of                                         
              xenobiotics.                                                                   
                                                                                             
              Scope:  This project brings the expertise of a                                 
              junior research scientist from the Center of                                   
              Advanced Molecular Biology (CAMB) of the                                       
              University of Punjab, Pakistan to work with a                                  
              senior researcher from Oakland University in                                   
              Rochester, MI on a topic that is of significant                                
              scientific as well as practical interest.  The                                 
              CAMB is one of Pakistan's most dynamic research                                
              institutes with a number of young researchers                                  
              who are beginning to contribute to the world                                   
              research publications in the fast evolving                                     
              molecular biology field.  The linkage promoted                                 
              by this project is likely to benefit the two                                   
              scientists and enhance the potential for useful                                
              joint U.S.-Pakistan research in the future.
