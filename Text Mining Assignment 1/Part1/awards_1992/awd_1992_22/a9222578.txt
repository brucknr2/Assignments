Abstract    :
                   This project encompasses a number of important topics relating            
              to the dynamics and predictability of the atmosphere.  Dr. Robinson            
              will employ a suite of models, ranging from simple to complex                  
              general circulation models, to examine the following:                          
                   (1)  what determines the temporal and spatial scales of the               
                   low frequency variability in atmospheric models and in the                
                   atmosphere,                                                               
                   (2)  the relative contributions of the tropics and                        
                   midlatitudes to low frequency variability,                                
                   (3)  the extent of dependence of atmospheric predictability on            
                   the initial large-scale flow pattern,                                     
                   (4)  the relationship between US summer climate (and rainfall)            
                   to the interannual variability of sea surface temperatures,               
                   particularly in the tropics.                                              
                   This research builds on his prior studies in which he                     
              demonstrated the strong coupling between synoptic scale eddies and             
              low frequency variability of the atmosphere, namely that the                   
              synoptic eddies serve as the principal energy sources for low                  
              frequency phenomena.  This has important implications for the                  
              predictability of atmospheric flows.
