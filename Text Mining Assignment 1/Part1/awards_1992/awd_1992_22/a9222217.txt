Abstract    :
              In this project in the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program                 
              of the Chemistry Division, Clouthier will continue to study the                
              electronic spectroscopy of highly reactive intermediates in                    
              supersonic expansions.  His experimental work will be                          
              supplemented by ab initio calculations of spectroscopic                        
              parameters.  Systems chosen for examination include carbenes                   
              and their germanium analogs (e.g., GeF2 or HGeCl) as well as                   
              HCOCN and PO2.  In the past Clouthier has been instrumental in                 
              developing pyrolysis jet and pulsed discharge jet sources and                  
              using them to produce and analyze spectra of such transient                    
              species.                                                                       
              %%%                                                                            
              It is important to establish sensitive methods for detecting                   
              and characterizing reactive species in order to optimize                       
              industrial processes.  The most useful analytical methods for                  
              studying reactive molecules in industrial systems are those                    
              that can be applied in situ.  The spectroscopic tools applied                  
              in this project, laser-induced fluorescence in particular, are                 
              very sensitive methods for detecting the transient chemical                    
              species which participate in such processes as combustion or                   
              chemical vapor deposition, which is used in the manufacture of                 
              semiconductors.
