Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  The howler (Alouatta), wooly (Lagothrix), and spider monkey               
              (Ateles) are large New World monkeys and exhibit diverse locomotor             
              patterns ranging from above-branch quadrupedalism to specialized               
              suspensory progression below supports.  For a variety of reasons,              
              their behaviors have come to be used as models for interpreting the            
              functional morphology of fossil catarrhine primates of the old                 
              world, and our own ancestors.                                                  
                                                                                             
                   This research project will determine the adaptive significance            
              of the positional behaviors (locomotor, postural, and manipulatory)            
              of these three genera of New World monkeys, and the functional                 
              significance of the postcranial morphology that generates those                
              behaviors.  The project integrates several approaches;                         
              morphological analysis, quantiative skeletal morphometrics, and                
              radiography; motion analysis of video recordings; and observations             
              in natural habitats.  The integration of these approaches will                 
              produce a coherent body of results concerning relationships among              
              morphology, positional behavior and habitat structure.
