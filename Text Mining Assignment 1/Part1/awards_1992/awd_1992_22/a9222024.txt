Abstract    :
              Measurement of threshold charged pion production will be carried               
              out for proton-proton scattering, including spin degrees of                    
              freedom, in order to explore model dependencies of the                         
              fundamental reaction mechanisms.  This work will be done at the                
              internal target facility of the Indiana University Cyclotron                   
              Facility.  In addition, work on the important inner tracking                   
              chamber of the CEBAF large acceptance detector will be carried                 
              out.  The latter is in support of an approved experiment at CEBAF              
              for which this Pitt group is the lead group.  In this activity,                
              the quark sub-structure of nucleon resonances will be probed                   
              through their momentum transfer dependence.
