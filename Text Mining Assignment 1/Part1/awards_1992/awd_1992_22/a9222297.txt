              The primary objective of this U.S.-Hungary                                     
              research project between Dr. Lawrence A.

              Dr. I. Foldvari  of the Research Laboratory for                                
              Crystal Physics, Budapest is to study the                                      
              defect properties of nonlinear optical                                         
              crystals.  Specific materials to be                                            
              investigated include doped and undoped single                                  
              crystals of a new bismuth oxide, Bi2TeO5 as                                    
              well as other materials that possess an                                        
              intrinsic luminescence, (ZnWO4, Bi4Ge3O12,                                     
              Bi12GeO20, Bi12SiO20 and Bi12TiO20).  Single                                   
              crystals will be grown at the Research                                         
              Laboratory for Crystal Physics in Hungary using                                
              the Czochralski technique while crystal                                        
              characterization will be performed at the                                      
              University of Connecticut before and after                                     
              electron irradiation using electron                                            
              paramagnetic resonance, optical and                                            
              spectroscopy.  The experimental efforts will                                   
              include studies of point defects and their                                     
              involvement in scintillation, photorefractive,                                 
              and photochromic processes in these materials.                                 
              Comparisons of the results for the different                                   
              crystals will contribute to our basic                                          
              understanding of these phenomena.  In addition,                                
              complementary theoretical studies will build                                   
              upon results of the researchers' previous                                      
              collaboration on cluster modeling of defects in                                
              paratellurite and will extend those methods to                                 
              Bi2TeO5.  Overall, combined results should                                     
              improve our knowledge of those oxide crystals                                  
              with properties that also have a potential for                                 
              applications in optical devices.                                               
                                                                                             
              This project in condensed matter physics                                       
              fulfills the program objectives of advancing                                   
              science by enabling leading experts in the U.S.                                
              and Hungary to combine complementary talents                                   
              and pool research resources in the areas of                                    
              strong mutual interest and competence.
