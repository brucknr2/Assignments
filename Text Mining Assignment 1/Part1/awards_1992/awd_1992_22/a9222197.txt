              Cells of the adult central nervous system (CNS) have a very limited ability to
              compensate for injury and cell death in the brain.  This is due in part to the
              lack of growth and division of the major cell type of the brain; neurons.  This
              prevents restoration of normal brain function following injury to neruons
              during strokes, unconsciousness and many neurodegenerative diseases.  The
              reason for the inability of neurons to divide is unknown, but may involve an
              abnormal growth of another cell type, astroglia, in response to injury. 
              Importantly, when astroglial cells multiply, they form a dense, scar-like area
              in the injured brain.  It is thought that this multiplication of astroglial
              cells effectively blocks regrowth of neurons and prevents the reestablishment
              of neuron connections called synapses.  Dr. Brennan will investigate why under
              certain circumstances astroglia cells are capable of cell division an d how
              this might be switched off, thus preventing the glial scar formation seen in
              neural injuries.  The long-term goal of this research is to understand the
              factors which regulate cell growth and division in the CNS so that the
              treatment of neural injury and degenerative diseases of the nervous system may
              begin. ***
