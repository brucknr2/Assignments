Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                                         ABSTRACT                                            
                                                                                             
                  This research concerns the origins and consequences of                    
              individual differences in infants' reactions to stress.  It is                 
              focused on the relation between stress, cortisol release (a                    
              physiological indicator of stress), and measures of behavioral                 
              distress in infants and toddlers.  It involves a longitudinal                  
              study between birth and 18 months of age.  Adrenocortical and                  
              behavioral stress responses will be assess for PKU screening at                
              birth and routine inoculation at 6 and 18 months if age.                       
              Maternal caregiving practices and family stress will be assessed               
              when infants are 3 months of age.  Quality of mother-infant                    
              attachment as well as infant visual self-recognition, self-                    
              conscious emotion, and health will be assessed when infants are                
              18 months of age.  The research will inform us not only about                  
              infant reactivity to stress using both behavioral and                          
              adrenocortical responses, but also the impact of the mother-                   
              infant relationship in infant stress reactivity as well as the                 
              impact of both infant stress reactivity and he mother-infant                   
              relationship in early infancy on subsequent outcomes in the                    
              domains of infant health and socioemotional functioning.  This                 
              information is important both theoretically and practically, and               
              will enrich our understanding of fundamental developmental                     
              processes in infancy.
