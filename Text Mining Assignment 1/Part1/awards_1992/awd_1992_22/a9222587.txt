Abstract    :
              This grant from the Organic Dynamics Program supports the work of              
              Professor Barry K. Carpenter at Cornell University who will assess             
              the circumstances under which dynamics play a role in the outcome              
              of a reaction. Specifically designed molecules will be synthesized             
              for the study of the fundamentals of intramolecular energy                     
              transfer, which will test the `statistical' TST and RRKM models.               
              Dynamically controlled reactions in supercritical fluids will be               
              studied in order to analyze the components of solvent effects on               
              molecular dynamics. A vector model for intramolecular dynamics will            
              be evaluated and a new molecular dynamics-based model will be                  
              development.

              In this project Professor Barry K. Carpenter will assess the                   
              circumstances under which dynamics play a role in the outcome of a             
              reaction, which is highly significant subject to a large area of               
              chemistry. Classical theories that are half a century old will be              
              tested with carefully designed experiments. The results may impinge            
              upon vast areas of chemical dynamics theory and may change the way             
              we think about reaction dynamics in the future.
