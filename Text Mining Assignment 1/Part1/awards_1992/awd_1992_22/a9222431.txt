Abstract    :
              This project will greatly improve research, educational and public             
              service activities at the New Mexico State University herbarium,               
              which maintains a research collection of 60,000 specimens from New             
              Mexico habitats and surrounding areas.  Specific improvements                  
              include herbarium cases to relieve crowding, replace older                     
              inadequate cases and accommodate growth for the next 4-5 years.                
              Other improvements are a microscope for student and visitor use and            
              acid-free folders to replace ones that are potentially damaging to             
              specimens.

              This project will greatly improve research, educational and public             
              service activities at the New Mexico State University herbarium,               
              which maintains a strong regional plant collection representing                
              habitats from New Mexico and surrounding areas.  The collection                
              will receive new cases to relieve crowding and accommodate 4-5                 
              years' growth, as well as a microscope for student and visitor use.            
              Apart from students at the university, the plant collection is a               
              resource for many local, state and federal agencies involved in                
              land management, ecological studies, conservation and tourism.
