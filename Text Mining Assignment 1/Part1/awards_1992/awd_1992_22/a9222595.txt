Abstract    :
                   The objective of this grant is to explore midlatitude seasonal            
              cycle and subseasonal interactions, especially during spring and               
              fall.  Hypothesis:  seasonal transitions are analogous to                      
              laboratory flow regime transitions, i.e., they involve                         
              instabilities and intermittencies, and the exhibit hysteresis.                 
                                                                                             
              The methodology involves using EOF and harmonic analysis The PI                
              will compare the seasonal cycle in ECMWF global analyses for the               
              1980's with decade-long simulations computed by NCAR Community                 
              Climate Model version 2 (CCM2) and by a quasigeostrophic model. One            
              CCM2 simulation will be forced by interannually varying sea surface            
              temperatures.  The PI will track the time-varying position of the              
              midlatitude jet during spring and fall to document seasonal                    
              transition time scales, intermittencies, and winter to summer                  
              versus summer to winter hysteresis.                                            
                                                                                             
              The expected significance of this research is validation of the                
              seasonal cycle in the CCM2.  If the CCM2 does not realistically                
              model the "climate change" that occurs during the seasonal cycle,              
              its reliability in simulating climate change in other contexts will            
              be open to question.  Also it is expected that we will gain                    
              increased understanding of seasonal transition processes.
