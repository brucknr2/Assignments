Abstract    :
              The objective of this research is to develop computer models for               
              integrated design of steel structures using several emerging                   
              computer technologies.  They include object-oriented programming               
              (OOP), genetic algorithms, neural network computing, and concurrent            
              processing.  The research includes development of a) a blackboard              
              architecture for integrated design of steel structures using the               
              OOP paradigm, b) an object-oriented database management system                 
              using an enhanced entity relationship model for managing a                     
              multitude of input, intermediate, and output data encountered in               
              integrated design of steel structures, c) an object-oriented                   
              version management model based on the parallel version graph, d)               
              an augmented Lagrangian genetic algorithm for detailed design of               
              steel structures, e) an adaptive conjugate gradient integrated                 
              design machine learning algorithm for training of multilayer                   
              feedforward neural networks, f) a hybrid learning algorithm by                 
              integrating genetic algorithm with error backpropagation multilayer            
              neural networks, g) concurrent algorithms for integrated/optimum               
              design of large steel structures such as highrise buildings using              
              the multiprocessing capabilities of shared memory machines (Cray               
              YMP 8/864) and distributed multicomputers (transputers), and h)                
              concurrent algorithms for the hybrid neural networks/genetic                   
              algorithm.
