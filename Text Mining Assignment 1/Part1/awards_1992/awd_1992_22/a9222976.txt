Abstract    :
              This project involves studies of novel magneto-optically active                
              materials.  The structures include artificially structured magnetic            
              multilayers, thin films and nanoscale clusters of nanocrystalline              
              composites, and manganese-based compounds and films with                       
              anisotropic structures.  The work will focus on 1) the                         
              relationships between magnetization reversal, domain dynamics, and             
              nanostructures of the films, and 2) fundamental magneto-optical                
              properties of novel phases synthesized to produce significant                  
              magneto-optic effects.  A range of magnetization measurements will             
              be performed.  In addition, spectroscopic ellipsometry will be used            
              to fully characterize the dielectric tensor properties of the                  
              materials.  In selected cases, photoemission measurements will be              
              used to study the electronic structure of the new compounds.  The              
              measurements will increase the understanding of fundamental                    
              relationships between electronic structure and magneto-optics in               
              several new classes of transition metal compounds.

              Magnetic thin films and particulate magnetic materials are being               
              synthesized and studied to determine their megneto-optic properties            
              -- which are critical in determining their utility as magnetic                 
              storage media.  The objective of the research is to prepare new                
              materials with enhanced properties and potential for use in optical            
              storage discs, computer hard discs, and other form of magnetic                 
              storage device.  The fundamental properties of the materials will              
              be investigated by magnetic and optical spectroscopy techniques.
