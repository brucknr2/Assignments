Abstract    :
                   A High performance workstation for image processing, 3D                   
              computer graphics, volume visualization, and computationally                   
              intensive signal processing will be procured and dedicated to                  
              research in imaging science.  Specific research projects utilizing             
              this equipment include:                                                        
                                                                                             
              Image Noise Reduction in Pattern Space                                         
                                                                                             
              A Prototype Active Vision System                                               
                                                                                             
              Automatic Tissue Characterization in MR Imaging                                
                                                                                             
              MR/PET Image Registration                                                      
                                                                                             
              Two-Dimensional ARMA Model Order Determination                                 
                                                                                             
              These projects are intended to have both practical and theoretical             
              impact upon a number of current problems in imaging science.
