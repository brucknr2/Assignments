Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The primary objective of this research is to examine the skeletons             
              from a well documented archaeological sequence (Illinois Valley) in            
              an attempt to detect the development of more expert bone setting               
              over time.  The working hypothesis is that, with increasing                    
              specialization of roles with increasingly complex societal                     
              structure, medical/healing techniques should have become more                  
              adept.  This is a new idea, and will call for a new approach of                
              skeletal materials, with readily available techniques.  The idea               
              and approach are novel, and the proposal is a very modest one.
