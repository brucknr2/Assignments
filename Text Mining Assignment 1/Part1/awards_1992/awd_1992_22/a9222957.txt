Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  Verification and logic simulation systems shall be developed              
              within this undertaking and dedicated to projects involving VLSI               
              design-for test.  Individual projects include:                                 
                                                                                             
              *  Diagnostic chip for IEEE Standard 1149.1 boundary-scan boards.              
                                                                                             
              *  Self-test using MISR and parallel shift register sequence                   
                 generator.                                                                  
                                                                                             
              *  Burst-error correcting and self-repair ROM.                                 
                                                                                             
              *  Test by approximation of Boolean function system.
