Abstract    :
                   This award provides funding to the University of California-              
              Berkeley, Industry/University Cooperative Research Center for                  
              Integrated Sensors for a project titled I/UCRC Video Production,               
              Cataloging and Evaluation:"IUCRC Showcase".  This is a two part                
              project consisting of the following:  Project A: scripting and                 
              filming an eight to ten minute video about the I/UCRC program for              
              use by IUCRCs for instructional and promotional purposes; and                  
              Project B: enhancing technology integration via the collection,                
              cataloging and evaluating videos that describe the operations of               
              individual IUCRCs.  The video will address the following points:               
              1) How NSF/Industry/University Centers operate; 2) The advantages              
              of Center membership; 3) What happens at a Center's Industrial                 
              Advisory Board meeting; 4) Topics Centers address; and 5) Total                
              number of Centers and what they do.  Project A will be designed                
              to permit any I/UCRC to add material that describes their                      
              Center's work specifically and will be produced at UC-Berkeley,                
              under the direction of Professor Richard White, Co-Director of                 
              the Berkeley I/UCRC.  In Project B, videotapes and related                     
              graphical materials highlighting I/UCRC research programs will be              
              solicited, collected, and analyzed, and classified and coded onto              
              an archival database.  From this video archive, a "technology                  
              integration" module will be prepared to supplement the "IUCRC                  
              Showcase" video of Project A.  Project B will be produced at the               
              University of Connecticut, under the direction of Professor Don                
              Hempel, Evaluator for the I/UCRC for Grinding Research and                     
              Development.                                                                   
                   The Program Director recommends that the University of                    
              California-Berkeley be awarded $118,977 for this project.                      
              Funding for this project will be as follows: $101,365 in FY 92 and             
              $17,612 in FY 93.
