Abstract    :
              This proposal requests support to study laboratory electron                    
              excitation cross sections and develop a new method for the study of            
              ionization-excitation branching ratios for atmospheric species.                
              Electron excitation and ionization of atmospheric constituents                 
              takes place in the atmospheres of Earth, the major planets and                 
              certain of their satellites, and objects such as comets.  Knowledge            
              of the electron impact and ionization processes is necessary to                
              understand how rapidly electrons lose energy in aeronomical                    
              processes as well as what specific excitations they produce.                   
              During the period of the proposed grant, the atomic nitrogen and               
              oxygen cross section sets will be obtained using a new type of                 
              atomic source currently under development and complete measurements            
              on ionization branching ratios for N2 and other species will be                
              carried out.  It will be possible to provide a large amount of new             
              cross section data to the aeronomy community as a result of work on            
              this grant.
