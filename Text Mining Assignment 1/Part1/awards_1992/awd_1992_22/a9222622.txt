Abstract    :
                   This Research Opportunity Award funds a project "Magnetic                 
              Properties of Cretaceous/Tertiary Glass, Tektites and Nuclear Waste            
              Glass" at Howard University in support of Alfred University's                  
              Industry/University Cooperative Research Center for Glass.  This               
              two-year project is reporting to the Center's Industry Advisory                
              Board.                                                                         
                   The project is studying the ionic, molecular and crystalline              
              species in certain natural and nuclear waste glasses.                          
                   The Program Manager recommends Howard University be awarded               
              $50,000 for two years.
