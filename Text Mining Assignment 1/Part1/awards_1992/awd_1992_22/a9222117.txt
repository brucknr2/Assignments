Abstract    :
                   Equipment for the development of a controlled and automated               
              environment for vision experiments shall be added to the Computer              
              Vision Laboratory.  The key features of this environment include:              
              controlled illumination techniques, controlled positioning of                  
              sensors and illumination sources, precise measurement of                       
              radiometric and spectral characteristics of a scene.  The following            
              are some of the research projects for which the equipment will be              
              dedicated.
