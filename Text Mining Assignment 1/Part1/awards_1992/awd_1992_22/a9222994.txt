Abstract    :
              Questions about the ethical responsibilities of professional                   
              archaeologists are more pressing than ever, given the                          
              accelerating degradation of archaeological resources and the                   
              pressures brought to bear on their disposition by an increasingly              
              diverse range of interest groups.  In response to this, the                    
              Society for American Archaeology has initiated a process of                    
              review of its existing policies on professional responsibility                 
              and ethics.  This project consists of a focused working                        
              conference that will bring together participants from a wide                   
              spectrum of archaeology and museum studies, who have been active               
              on ethical issues in a range of contexts.  The aim of the meeting              
              is to set the framework for a process of wide consultation with                
              members of this society and other interested and involved                      
              organizations and groups.  The ultimate goal of this process is                
              to formulate an updated and integrated set of ethics guidelines                
              and a program of action that will help archaeologists fulfill                  
              responsibilities that they bear, not only to the discipline of                 
              archaeology and its scientific ideals, but also to non-                        
              archaeological interest groups and to the conservation of                      
              cultural resources.
