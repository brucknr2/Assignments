Abstract    :
              This award will fund Undergraduate Design Projects to develop                  
              custom software and/or devices for persons with disabilities.                  
              This is a joint undertaking between faculty/students at IIT and                
              staff/patients at Marianjoy Rehabilitation Hospital.  The group                
              will work on six projects per year and will provide written                    
              reports on the projects completed.                                             
                                                                                             
              This type of undertaking is important since not only will it                   
              provide meaningful projects for engineering students to complete               
              as part of their education, but it will also benefit a population              
              where customization is usually required to increase the                        
              usefulness of the devices and/or software.
