Abstract    :
              9222651  Vaida       This research focuses on the role that the photochemistry
              of  bimolecular complexes could play in the chemical balance of the 
              troposphere.  To provide the data base needed to include this  chemistry in
              tropospheric models, the following studies will be  conducted.       The
              results anticipated from this work will give absorption  cross-sections and
              photochemical quantum yields for bimolecular  complexes of 03, S02, and CS2. 
              Based on this data, it will be  possible to predict the importance of the
              photochemistry of  bimolecular complexes in oxidation processes in the
              troposphere.
