Abstract    :
              This dissertation research project will enable the student                     
              researcher to complete a dissertation which examines the                       
              intersections of feminist theory and social studies of science as              
              applied to research in biomechanics and related fields.  The                   
              proposed research is a study of the scientific and technical                   
              practice of researchers in biomechanics and related fields.  The               
              study will focus on practices in setting research priorities,                  
              modelling, and representation, and how patterns of authority and               
              the relations between gender and power affect these practices.                 
              The project will bridge two gaps in contemporary science and                   
              technology studies: (1) between formally sociological studies of               
              laboratories and institutions and culturally oriented studies of               
              representations in science; and (2) between feminist criticisms                
              of science and theories of science, technology and society.                    
              Particularly, the study will focus on (1) the intersection of                  
              representations in scientific practice and larger cultural                     
              metaphors of body as machine; (2) the practices, such as                       
              filtering, selection, and ordering, that go into the measurement               
              and mathematization of natural objects; (3) the general                        
              organization of knowledge work in science and engineering.  This               
              modest grant will allow the student to travel to several initial               
              and three new research sites in order to conduct the necessary                 
              interviews and observations.  The dissertation should be                       
              completed by December, 1993.
