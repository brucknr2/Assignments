Abstract    :
                   The research concerns singularities of solutions of partial               
              differential equations on manifolds. Implicit in this work are                 
              heat-equation analysis and topology of singular spaces. From this              
              one can study Hilbert/Fredhom complexes and related cohomology                 
              theories. This leads to certain generalizations of the classical               
              Riemann-Roch theorem.
