Abstract    :
              9222322  Knapp  This award will fund Undergraduate Design Projects to  develop
              custom devices for persons with disabilities.  This  group will work with
              therapists and patients at a  rehabilitation hospital which focuses on physical
               disabilities.  Ten projects per year will be undertaken by  the groups and
              reports on the completed projects will be  included in a publication that will
              detail the projects  completed at all institutions participating in this
              program.    This type of experience is important since not only will it 
              provide meaningful projects for the engineering students to  complete as part
              of their education, but it will also  benefit a population where customization
              is usually required  of many rehabilitation devices.  ***
