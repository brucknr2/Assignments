Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This project will produce a systematic revision,                               
              clarifying relationships of the members of the family                          
              Cryptophagidae, a group of beetles with many members                           
              that are fungus feeders.  Character traits of adult                            
              morphology will be investigated in this analysis and                           
              computer assisted methods of examining data will be                            
              used.  Interesting patterns of shifts between fungus                           
              feeding and plant feeding and loss of flight                                   
              capabilities among different species will be explored.
