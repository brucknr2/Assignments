Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                                         ABSTRACT                                            
                                                                                             
                                                                                            
              During the 1980s statistical techniques for analysis for                       
              geographical patterns have been refined to the point that they may             
              be applied to data from many different fields. This project will               
              implement density-estimation algorithms to draw differential-                  
              frequency boundaries for language data, using the extensive                    
              computer files of the Linguistic Atlas of the Middle and South                 
              Atlantic States (LAMSAS); these boundaries will then be compared to            
              dialect feature boundaries generated with pre-statistical                      
              qualitative methods and to boundaries of selected topographical and            
              cultural areas. Prior NSF support assisted the development of                  
              efficient small-computer methods to encode LAMSAS data and to                  
              develop preliminary methods for its statistical analysis. This                 
              project will process files from the existing data-bases with                   
              statistical algorithms and with GIS (Geographical Information                  
              System) software for displays; a Sun work station will provide fast            
              processing for computer-intensive statistics and graphics. Specific            
              programs will be written by a consultant to implement density-                 
              estimation for LAMSAS data and to enable comparison with digitized             
              maps of older boundaries under GIS. Approximately 50 items will                
              receive comprehensive analysis and comparison, leading to several              
              articles on the nature of areal variation  when it is conceived as             
              the differential frequency of linguistic features, and on the                  
              relation of this quantitative method to earlier qualitative                    
              methods.
