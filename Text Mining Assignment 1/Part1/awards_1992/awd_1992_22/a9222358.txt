Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Many speech sounds and musical tones are composed of harmonics,                
              which are frequencies that are roughly integer multiples of the                
              lowest frequency present.  The lowest or fundamental frequency of              
              a harmonic sound usually determines its pitch.  Yet when the                   
              fundamental frequency is removed while the upper harmonics remain              
              intact (as is the case for low voices heard over the telephone),               
              the pitch remains unchanged.  Furthermore, shifting the upper                  
              frequencies causes the pitch to change in complex ways.  This                  
              research will involve the refinement and testing of a theory of                
              auditory perception that accounts for these and other phenomena.               
              The theory postulates that as a result of the properties of                    
              auditory neurons and general principles of neural connectivity,                
              exposure to speech results in the neural encoding of harmonic                  
              patterns.  These neural encodings in turn filter the sounds we hear            
              so that frequencies that are blocked or distorted during                       
              transmission are effectively restored by the auditory system.  The             
              research will test the theory using computer simulations of a                  
              neural-net model and using perceptual experiments.  Understanding              
              how the auditory system recognizes sound patterns may in the future            
              guide the development of "smart" hearing devices that can                      
              compensate for selective loss of auditory function.
