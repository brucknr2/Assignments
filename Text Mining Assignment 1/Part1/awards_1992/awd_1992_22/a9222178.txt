Abstract    :
              This award is for support of a three year project to obtain a long             
              term record of the atmospheric deposition of the marine-derived                
              elements Sulfur, Bromine, Iodine, and Selenium.  The principle                 
              focus of the work is on the sulfur cycle, because of its role as               
              the major aerosol forming species in the atmosphere and its                    
              potential importance in climate regulation.  Samples from the                  
              Vostok and Taylor Dome ice cores will be analyzed for this study.              
              The ice core record of methansulfonate and non-seasalt sulfate will            
              be extended to include two complete glacial cycles in the deep                 
              Vostok ice core and analyses of a shallow, dry drilled ice core                
              from Vostok will allow the identification of any recent changes in             
              these parameters.  Analyses of the Taylor glacier ice core will                
              also be made for comparison with Vostok.
