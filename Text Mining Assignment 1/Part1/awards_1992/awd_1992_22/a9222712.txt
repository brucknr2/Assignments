Abstract    :
              This project is an experimental and theoretical investigation of               
              phase separations of ternary aqueous protein solutions.  The                   
              solutions will be studied by static and dynamic light scattering               
              spectroscopy as well as biochemical chromatographic and                        
              centrifugation methods.  The theoretical studies will use the                  
              Carnahan-Starling mixing entropy and a mean field model for the                
              interaction energies in order to construct a Gibbs free energy for             
              the system.  This will potentially provide a route to                          
              interpretation and prediction of phase boundaries and compositions             
              of coexisting phases.  The results will be of significance for the             
              general area of biomolecular materials purification and processing.
