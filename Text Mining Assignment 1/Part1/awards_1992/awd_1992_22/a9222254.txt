Abstract    :
              Rabaey         High Level Synthesis has undergone remarkable progress in  recent
              years. A number of powerful synthesis environments have  been proposed in the
              area of real time signal processing, both in  Europe and the United States.
              Unfortunately, most of the existing  tools span only restricted application
              domains or very specific  architectural styles. To be successful at an
              industrial level, a  unification of the synthesis approaches is clearly
              essential.          The goal of this research is to boost the field of 
              high-level synthesis for digital signal processing by bringing  together
              researchers from the IMEC Research Center at Leuven,  Belgium and the
              University of California at Berkeley. The  objectives are to exchange synthesis
              techniques and tools in an  attempt to come to a unified framework, addressing
              the global  architectural domain. At the same time, this cooperation will 
              result in the training of researchers with a wider vision and  scope of
              expertise in the field of high level synthesis.
