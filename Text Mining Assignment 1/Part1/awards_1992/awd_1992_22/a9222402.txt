Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Supported by an International Travel Grant, two graduate                       
              students will present papers at two conferences in Australia.                  
              These are The Sixth International Conference on Physics of                     
              Estuaries and Coastal Seas, and The Eleventh Australasian                      
              Conference on Fluid Mechanics. Both conferences will be held                   
              in December of 1992.                                                           
                                                                                             
              The work, supported by a grant from NSF, describes new results                 
              that define vertical mixing rates in density-stratified                        
              turbulent shear flows. Such mixing plays a crucial role in a                   
              variety of environmental pollution problems.
