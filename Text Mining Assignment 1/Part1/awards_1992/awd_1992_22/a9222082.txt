Abstract    :
              This award will support a three day                                            
              workshop on surgical applications                                              
              of robotics, and also will cover                                               
              advanced sensors, real-time                                                    
              computing, and related

              progress and determine the research                                            
              required to overcome the obstacles;                                            
              and 3) to identify  new research                                               
              opportunities created by emerging                                              
              technologies.
