Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The escape response of the cockroach Periplaneta americana has been            
              characterized as a simple behavior:  a cockroach turns away from an            
              attacking predator and then runs.  A set of wind-sensory giant                 
              interneurons has long been known to mediate this response.  Based              
              on studies from our laboratory and others, it has become clear that            
              escape can be elicited by stimuli other than wind, and be mediated             
              by sensory interneurons other than the classic giants.  In                     
              behavioral studies we found that touch is a potent cue for escape,             
              and we have identified several touch-sensory interneurons that                 
              appear likely to be involved in escape.                                        
                                                                                             
              We propose experiments to clarify the control of cockroach escape              
              by wind-sensory interneurons, and to examine the organization of               
              touch-sensory interneurons and their relationship to the wind-                 
              sensory system.  The experiments will involve recording from and               
              stimulating specific interneurons, mapping the afferent input to               
              the interneurons, and assessing behavioral functions by multiple               
              cell (electrolytic) and single cell (enzymatic injection) lesioning            
              techniques.  Even the "simple" escape response of insects shows                
              evidence of complex multisensory control.  Since the behavior also             
              can be related to identified central neurons, it provides a model              
              system for understanding sensorimotor integration at a cellular                
              level.//
