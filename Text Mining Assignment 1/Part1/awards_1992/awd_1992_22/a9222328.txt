Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                                         ABSTRACT                                            
                                                                                             
                  This research will result in a compilation of a Rumsen                    
              dictionary and material for a future Rumsen grammar. The data                  
              base consists of a copy of Prof. William Shipley's slip file,                  
              based on a portion of J.P. Harrington's Rumsen field notes, and                
              copies of microfilms of the remainder of those field notes.                    
                                                                                             
                   The Principal Investigator (PI) will direct a post-doctoral               
              Research Associate 2 in the compilation of the dictionary. The                 
              Research Associate will have at her disposal a Zenith-100                      
              Personal Computer with a hard disk and an Epson LQ-500 Printer or              
              the equivalent. She will enter the Rumsen words and sentences                  
              onto the hard disk in the form of dictionary entries.  Principal               
              entries will consist of underlying stems, with derived stems as                
              subentries. Example sentences will be included to illustrate the               
              range of meaning.  Affixes will also be included in the                        
              dictionary, but their full analysis will await the Rumsen                      
              grammar.                                                                       
                                                                                             
                   The Rumsen dictionary will greatly aid the PI in her on-                  
              going reconstruction of Proto Costanoan (the original Costanoan                
              language) and Proto Utian (the original Miwok-Costanoan                        
              language). The project will also provide extensive data for                    
              Amerindianists generally.
