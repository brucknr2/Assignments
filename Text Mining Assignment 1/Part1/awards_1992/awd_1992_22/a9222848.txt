Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Neuropeptides, a very heterogenous group of compounds located                  
              throughout the brain, play an important role in the communication              
              of signals between neurons.  Some neuropeptides function as                    
              traditional neurotransmitters while other perform modulatory or                
              regulatory roles.  The proenkephalin peptides function as                      
              signaling molecules in the brain and hormones in the peripheral                
              system.  Dr. McMurray is interested in the mechanisms by which                 
              cell surface receptors can signal the turning on and off of the                
              proenkephalin gene.  By using an experimental approach that                    
              includes a powerful combination of biophysical and molecular                   
              biological techniques, she will characterize protein-DNA                       
              interactions involved in the transactivation of the human                      
              enkephalin gene.  Dr. McMurray has developed genetically-                      
              engineered regulatory proteins to examine the signals that occur               
              between the cell surface and the gene.  Moreover, she will use                 
              both natural genes and genetically altered genes to determine how              
              the regulatory proteins interact with brain signaling genes to                 
              "turn on" expression.  The results from these studies will                     
              provide a detailed molecular structure and function of the                     
              proenkephalin gene.  These findings may lead to new insights in                
              the fundamental processes underlying gene expression and begin to              
              unravel the receptor-mediated pathways that are commonly used in               
              both hormonal responses and neurotransmission.
