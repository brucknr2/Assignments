Abstract    :
                   This project plans to study the dopant effects on surface and             
              interfacial properties in alumina.  It will examine the effects of             
              dopants, such as Ca, Mg, and Ti on the relative energies and                   
              thermodynamica stabilities of different crstallographic planes                 
              through measurements of equilibrium pore shapes.  It will also                 
              study the Rayleigh instability of lithographically introduced pore             
              channels with preexistent finite amplitude perturbations of known              
              but systematically varied wavelength.  Finally, it will also study             
              the grain growth, pore drag, amd pore-boundary separation, by                  
              varying pore size, shape, and spacing at the interface between                 
              undoped and doped single-crystal and polycrystalline alumina.

              This proposal uses a lithography-based method for studying pore-               
              boundary interactions.  It studies the effects of dopants such Mg,             
              Ca, and Ti on the pore-boundary separation conditions and on                   
              surface diffusion in alumina.  Through this approach, the effect of            
              these dopants on the surface energy anisotropy in alumina can be               
              critically investigated.    The role of anisotropy on the                      
              microstructural development can be ascertained, and it will be very            
              helpful to the fabrication of in-situ composites such as those with            
              elonagated grain structures.
