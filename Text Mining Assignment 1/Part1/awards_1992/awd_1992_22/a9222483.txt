Abstract    :
              9222483  Walsh  The goal of the research supported by this award is to 
              understand the interaction of the mid-infrared laser  radiation with tissue. 
              The overall objective is to  determine the potential of these lasers for
              medical/surgical  use.  This study will focus on the dynamic changes in the 
              optical absorption properties of water and tissue in the mid-  infrared region
              for high-power laser irradiation.  Experimental measurements will be performed
              and a model to  predict the effects of dynamic optical property changes on 
              ablation rate, residual thermal damage, shock wave induced  damage and ablation
              pressure will be developed and tested.    This research is important since it
              could lead to  fundamental improvements in the use of mid-infrared lasers  for
              research and medical uses.  ***
