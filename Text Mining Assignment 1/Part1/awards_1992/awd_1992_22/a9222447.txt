Abstract    :
              The REPI region is part of an iron transport system-replication                
              unit that we found to be conserved in bacterial plasmids carrying              
              the aerobactin iron transport genes.  The REPI replication region              
              endows the cell with incompatibility properties corresponding to               
              the IncFI group and must have been instrumental in the preservation            
              and epidemiological spread of the aerobactin system.  This replicon            
              is frequently found in bacterial plasmids, however little is known             
              on the mechanism controlling its replication and maintenance, as               
              well as on the mechanisms that result in the expression of the                 
              IncFI phenotype.  We successfully analyzed and characterized the               
              DNA sequences and product(s) involved in the control of replication            
              of REPI-containing plasmids; purified and characterized the trans-             
              acting protein RepI, essential for REPI replication, and dissected             
              the REPI incompatibility determinants.  Furthermore, we have                   
              recently found that the iron concentration of the cell and                     
              expression of the fur (ferric uptake regulation) gene are part of              
              a novel regulatory circuit that acts in the control of copy number             
              of REPI.  We are now performing structure-function studies on the              
              RepI protein, and analyzing the mechanism of regulation of the copy            
              number REPI replicons by Fur and the iron status of the cell.                  
              %%%                                                                            
              This system stands out as a model to study the regulation of                   
              initiation of replication and its relationship to environmental                
              factors.
