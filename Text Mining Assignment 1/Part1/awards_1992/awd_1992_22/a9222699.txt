Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                                                                                            
              The brown mouse lemur, Microcebus rufus, is the world's smallest               
              living primate, and heretofore virtually nothing is known about its            
              natural history - it is nocturnal and is restricted to a section of            
              Madagascar.                                                                    
                                                                                             
              This dissertation project is designed to understand the basic                  
              survival and reproductive strategy of this secretive primate.  It              
              will involve observations on its reproductive pattern and                      
              potential, seasonal changes in natural diet, body weight and                   
              activity patterns, and seasonal patterns of spatial distribution.              
              Its importance to conservation strategies is very clear, as well as            
              the door it will open on nocturnal observations of such primates.
