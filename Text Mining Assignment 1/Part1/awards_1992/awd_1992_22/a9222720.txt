Abstract    :
                   A desktop parallel processing computer will be used to                    
              implement FORR, which is a general learning and problem solving                
              architecture that supports learning about behavior in a broad                  
              domain of related problem classes.  The architecture integrates                
              diverse problem solving heuristic into a common framework and                  
              constructs decisions from their inconsistent advice.  A parallel               
              approach to machine translation based on the principles of                     
              blackboard architecture will also be implemented .  Unlike                     
              conventional, sequential architectures for machine translation                 
              systems, the blackboard approach to MT offers a global workspace in            
              which multiple knowledge sources, each expert in a particular                  
              aspect of translation, can work in parallel to solve difficult                 
              problems.  For Japanese and English these include zero pronominals,            
              number, definiteness, and language style.  A third project involves            
              an alternative architecture for experimental comparison of software            
              test data adequacy criteria.  This approach harnesses the                      
              parallelism inherent in such experiments by coordinating a pool of             
              independent processors that implement the distinct criteria.  The              
              processors work together to decide which of the criteria they                  
              implement is better at exposing errors in the given program.
