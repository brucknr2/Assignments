Abstract    :
                   This award is to fund a 2-day workshop that will examine                  
              and identify areas in which NSF could have an impact on                        
              attracting and retaining women in academic careers in the                      
              computing sciences.  The workshop will address issues such as                  
              professional support and development, pipeline issues,                         
              academic faculty careers, visibility of women in the field,                    
              and partnerships between academia and industry.  It is                         
              anticipated that several initiatives and recommendations for                   
              programs will emanate from the workshop.                                       
                                                                                             
              Dr. Susan Conry will be organizing a workshop directed towards                 
              identifying how to extend the scope of opportunities for women                 
              to do research and teaching in the academic computing                          
              sciences.  The workshop will be organized around five or six                   
              major topic areas.  The workshop is expected to produce for                    
              the CISE Directorate, a set of recommended programs and                        
              initiatives.
