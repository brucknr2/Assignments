Abstract    :
                   The automation of classification learning is an ongoing                   
              concern in the machine learning, pattern recognition and statistics            
              communities.  People are very good at designing and collecting                 
              data, but less good at analyzing it and extracting useful                      
              generalizations.  It is necessary to improve the techniques for                
              automatic data analysis.  The state of the art in inductive                    
              learning is that there exist several dozen inductive learning                  
              algorithms/concept representations, each of which is best on some              
              proper subset of the possible inductive learning tasks.  The                   
              project will develop an efficient method for selecting the best                
              algorithm/concept representation for each recursive call of a                  
              divide-and-conquer tree induction algorithm.  The combination of               
              different representations into a hybrid significantly improves the             
              ability of the inductive learning program to find a highly accurate            
              generalization of the data.  The major objective of this research              
              will be an approach to learning that includes an efficient search              
              for an appropriate hybrid representation, guided by detection of               
              specific forms of hypothesis pathology.  The creation of systems               
              that search multiple representation spaces greatly increases the               
              autonomy of learning machine, which will make data analysis                    
              techniques accessible to a wider range of scientists.//
