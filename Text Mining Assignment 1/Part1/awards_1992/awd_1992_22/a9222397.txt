Abstract    :
              This award will fund Undergraduate Design Projects to develop                  
              custom software and/or devices for persons with disabilities.                  
              The design experience will be integrated into three courses which              
              will allow a full-year of participation by the students.  The                  
              students will work with institutions providing care or training                
              for the targeted populations and will provide written reports on               
              the projects completed each year.                                              
                                                                                             
              This type of undertaking is important since not only will it                   
              provide meaningful projects for engineering students to complete               
              as part of their education, but it will also benefit a population              
              where customization is usually required to increase the                        
              usefulness of the devices and/or software.
