Abstract    :
              9222640  Garmire  This project will continue our on-going investigations of
              nonlinear optics and carrier transport in semiconductors.  This transport in
              semniconductors and offers promise for improving the optical response of
              semiconductors.  By using advanced materials, which include multiple quantum
              wells (MQW) in dping superlatices (nipi structures), sensitive and large
              nonlinearities at useful wavelengths can be achieved.  Several collaborative
              projects are proposed which will all contribute to improved usefulness of
              semiconductor materials for nonlinear and optical applications.  These are: a)
              Mode-locking of Nd:YAG laser using saturabel absorption of GaInAsP at 1.06 um,
              b) Improved optical modulators consisting of SPSLS MQ W waveguides in p-i-n and
              inpi structures, C) Psec studies of carrier transprot in strained-layer
              InGaAs/GaAs MQW hetero-nipi's  modulators, d) Eperiments to better understand
              MQW hetero-nipi's e) Modelling carrier transport in  MQW hetero-nipi's, f)
              improved design for MQW hetero-nipi's.  Investigations to date at 980 nm will
              be extended to 1.3 um and/or 1.55 um in the proposed new project.  The proposed
              studies will provide no only more useful nonlinear optical devies, but also
              assist in the understanding of carrier transport within strained materials in
              the presence of both quantum wells and inernal fields. The results are needed
              for the better understanding of opto-electronic lasers, modulatores,
              detectores, and optical switches.  ***   v       s  t
