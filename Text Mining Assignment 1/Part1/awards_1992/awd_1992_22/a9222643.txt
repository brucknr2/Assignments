Abstract    :
              Today's microprocessors are much more remarkable in their                      
              similarities than in their differences, this is not likely to                  
              change for the foreseeable future.  By combining a fixed set of                
              datapath components with FPGA-implemented interconnect and control,            
              complex systems can be constructed that emulate different                      
              microprocessor architectures.  This research attempts to identify              
              target applications for which special-purpose processors can offer             
              performance gains.  Current areas of investigation include gene                
              sequence analysis and multimedia systems.  The objectives of this              
              research are the completion of a quantitative study of the utility             
              of FPGAs in the prototyping of large heterogeneous digital systems,            
              and the development of new FPGA architectures based on this study.             
              The methods employed consist of:  (1) the implementation of custom             
              microprocessors and general emulation systems on FPGAs; (2)                    
              quantitative analysis of these designs; (3) measurement of                     
              performance, power consumption, and other relevant parameters of               
              these designs; and (4) use of results to develop new FPGA                      
              architectures better suited to the prototyping of complex digital              
              systems.
