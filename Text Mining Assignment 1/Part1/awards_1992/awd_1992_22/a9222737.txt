Abstract    :
                   A color camera, real-time data processing boards, and a robot             
              arm shall be procured in order to support several research projects            
              in robotics.  These include:                                                   
                                                                                             
              *  3D vision in extreme clutter and partial occlusion.                         
                                                                                             
              *  3D orientation determination from image spectra                             
                                                                                             
              *  Fast vision algorithms.                                                     
                                                                                             
              *  Vision-based supervisory control of dual-arm robotics system.               
                                                                                             
              The research results stemming from these projects will be                      
              integrated in a manner so as to promote technology transfer to the             
              aerospace electronics industry.
