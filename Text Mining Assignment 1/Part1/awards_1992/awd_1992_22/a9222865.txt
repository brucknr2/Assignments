Abstract    :
                   The goal of this project is to establish a long term                      
              academic/industrial program in manufacturing and standards                     
              development, that will assist in the development and transformation            
              of the former Soviet Union (F.S.U.) as well as promote United                  
              States industrial growth in the F.S.U.  This effort will have                  
              United States researchers analyzing processes and procedures,                  
              numerically controlled programming standards, and production                   
              processes of the Moscow Aviation Institute (M.A.I.).  It will be               
              coordinated with efforts at the Massachusetts Institute of                     
              Technology and the Institute for Manufacturing and Automation                  
              Research at the University of Southern California.  The initial                
              work will be done in Moscow in partnership with Russian                        
              counterparts.  The counterparts (funded by M.A.I.) will then come              
              to the United States to continue on the same project.
