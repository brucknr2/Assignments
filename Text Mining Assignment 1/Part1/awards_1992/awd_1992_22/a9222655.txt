Abstract    :
              Professor Norman Allinger is supported by a grant from the                     
              Theoretical and Computational Chemistry Program to continue in                 
              his development of the MM3 empirical molecular mechanics force                 
              field.  This force field is parameterized on the basis of                      
              experimental data in the form of structures, vibrational                       
              frequencies, thermodynamic heats of formation, and when                        
              necessary supplemented with ab initio molecular orbital                        
              calculations.  The MM3 force field is widely used to perform                   
              molecular simulations of organic compounds including                           
              macromolecular species.  In this grant period, Professor                       
              Allinger will address a number of specific anomalies between                   
              current MM3 predictions and experimental observation which                     
              require special parameterization of the MM3 force field.  These                
              anomalies include: the anomeric effect, the Bohlmann effect,                   
              and the electronegativity effect on bond shorthening.

              Molecular structure and thermodynamic properties including the                 
              relative energies of different conformations are frequently                    
              related to the overal physical properties of organic compounds.                
              Chemists are constantly seeking links between molecular                        
              structure and physical properties which will assist them in                    
              directed synthesis of chemical species with desired physical                   
              properties and chemical activities.  Computer models of                        
              molecular structure have recently become a very important tool                 
              in the quantitative prediction of structure and properties.                    
              Although the more sophisticated molecular orbital theory is the                
              preferred technique for smaller molecules, empirical models                    
              such as MM3 are absolutely necessary for most larger molecules                 
              which are of interest to academic and industrial organic                       
              chemists.  Allinger's MM3 force field is one of the most widely                
              accepted empirical force fields which is used for this purpose.
