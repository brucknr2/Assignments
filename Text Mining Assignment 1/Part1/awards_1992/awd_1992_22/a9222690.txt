Abstract    :
                   The NSFNET infrastructure has expanded at an exponential rate             
              and has precipitated the need to evaluate trends that impact future            
              network development.  High performance computing and advanced 3-               
              dimensional graphics environment coupled with new media                        
              technologies provides an expanded visual domain to represent and               
              study complex network topology and data.                                       
                   This project will organize, aggregate, reduce, and investigate            
              large network databases while considering a design criteria that               
              can be applied to a more diverse set of information flow problems.             
              This study is a major step in the development, visualization, and              
              investigation of network data archives and can reveal communication            
              trends in the nsfnet and its components.  The archiving and                    
              distribution of this investigation will provide a valuable national            
              resource and has the potential of becoming a general purpose                   
              visualization tool for network analysis.
