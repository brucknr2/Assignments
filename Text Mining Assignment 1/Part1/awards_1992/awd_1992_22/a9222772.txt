Abstract    :
              This award supports the continued maintenance, collection,                     
              improvement and distribution of genetic stocks of Neurospora,                  
              Aspergillus and to a lesser extent other filamentous fungi at the              
              Fungal Genetics Stock Center (FGSC) currently located at                       
              University of Kansas Medical Center.  The FGSC was initially                   
              established at Dartmouth and has been continuously supported by                
              NSF.  Dr. John A. Kinsey serves as the Director of the FGSC and                
              oversees the operation of the Center.                                          
                                                                                             
              The ready availability of over 7,000 reliable genetic stocks from              
              FGSC has markedly stimulated the use of these organisms for                    
              research in genetics, molecular biology, biochemistry,                         
              microbiology, systematics, plant pathology, and other related                  
              fields.  In addition to genetic stocks, the FGSC maintains and                 
              distributes molecular tools for fungal research such as cloned                 
              genes and libraries of genomic or cDNA from filamentous fungi.                 
              Many of the strains in the collection are also used for                        
              educational purposes.  As part of its service to the community,                
              the FGSC prepares the Fungal Genetics Newsletter as well as a                  
              biannual catalog of available cultures and services.  The FGSC                 
              plans to expand its collection to include filamentous plant                    
              pathogenic fungi.  It also plans to establish an electronic                    
              Fungal Genetics bulletin board if there is sufficient interest in              
              the community.                                                                 
                                                                                             
              Further information can be obtained by contacting FGSC at 913/588-
