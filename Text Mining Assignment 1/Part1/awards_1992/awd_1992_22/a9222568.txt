Abstract    :
              In this study in the Theoretical and Computational Chemistry                   
              Program in the Division of Chemistry, a new theory is being                    
              developed to describe electronically diabatic processes in                     
              complex chemical systems.  The goal of this theory, which is                   
              based on time-dependent molecular orbitals, is to provide new                  
              insights, concepts, and methods for describing collision-                      
              induced and photo-induced electronic transitions.  A related                   
              objective is the development of methods for computing the time                 
              evolution of electronic state populations, differential and                    
              integral cross sections, and electronic branching ratios.                      
              Computer visualizations play an important part in these                        
              studies.  Applications are being made to the description of                    
              atom-atom, atom-diatom, and atom-solid surface collisions.

              The evolution in time of the properties of atoms and molecules                 
              as they undergo collisions or interactions with light can be                   
              described by modern theoretical and computational methods based                
              on quantum mechanics.  In this study new procedures for                        
              obtaining these descriptions are being developed and applied to                
              a wide variety of chemically interesting systems.
