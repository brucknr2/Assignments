Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This Americas Program award will support                                       
              collaborative research between Dr. Philip                                      
              Shevlin, Auburn University and Dr. Galo                                        
              Cardenas-Trivino, University of Concepcion,                                    
              Chile.  This award will supplement two existing                                
              NSF grants. The research involves the area of                                  
              carbon cluster chemistry and metal atom                                        
              chemistry.  It will focus on the use of metal                                  
              atoms as trapping agents for carbon clusters                                   
              and the synthesis of new cluster based                                         
              materials.  The experiments will cover a broad                                 
              area of research and are designed to provide a                                 
              framework for the investigators' approach to                                   
              carbon cluster chemistry.                                                      
                The complementary research instrumentation at                                
              both universities will play a large part in                                    
              facilitating the collaboration.  The new                                       
              cluster based materials will be synthesized in                                 
              Auburn while their reactions with metal atoms                                  
              will be carried out at Concepcion.                                             
              With the emerging importance of carbon cluster                                 
              chemistry and that of clusters in general, the                                 
              merge with metal atom chemistry has a potential                                
              impact on the infrastructure of chemistry.
