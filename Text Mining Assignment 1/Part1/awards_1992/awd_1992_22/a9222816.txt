Abstract    :
              Professor Skyrms is focussing his research on evaluating the                   
              explanatory significance of equilibrium concepts in biological and             
              decision sciences.  The significance of equilibrium depends on                 
              there being underlying dynamics.  Evolutionary and ecological                  
              dynamics are relevant in biology.  Various kinds of adaptational               
              and learning dynamics are relevant in decision sciences.  But when             
              the dynamics is explicitly modeled, new questions arise which may              
              call into question the explanatory significance of equilibrium.  We            
              are first led to ask:  "how is equilibrium reached?"  Perhaps the              
              dynamics does not lead to an equilibrium, but rather exhibits                  
              periodic, quasi-periodic, or chaotic behavior.   And even if                   
              equilibrium remains important, the most plausible dynamics may lead            
              to a revision of the equilibrium concept.  These considerations                
              have led Professor Skyrms to rethink the question of the                       
              explanatory significance of equilibrium.
