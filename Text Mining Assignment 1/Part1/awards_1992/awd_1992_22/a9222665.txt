Abstract    :
              This award is for partial support for a meeting to help train                  
              Mexican engineering evaluators who will later evaluate Mexican                 
              engineering programs using US Accreditation Board for Engineering              
              and Technology (ABET) standards.  Use of these standards by the                
              Mexicans, as well as giving them a uniform minimum standard for                
              their own use, will facilitate exchange of engineering students                
              between the US and Mexico, which is expected to increase under                 
              NAFTA.
