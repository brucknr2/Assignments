Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Although plasticity of the nervous systems has been viewed as the              
              property of the development central nervous system, increasing                 
              evidence indicate that the adult brain has great potential for                 
              modulation of functional organization and at least part of this                
              reflects hormonal effects.  The hypothalamo-neurohypophysial                   
              system has proved to be a useful model to study environmentally                
              induced neural plasticity.  Under conditions of increased                      
              physiological demand such as lactation, parturition and                        
              dehydration, neurosecretory cells in the supraoptic nucleus and                
              the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus undergo                        
              morphological changes reflecting an increase in manufacture and                
              release of neuropeptide hormones from the pituitary.   Dr.                     
              Beagley will determine whether non-painful stressors can change                
              the ultrastructural features of cells in these specific regions                
              of the hypothalamus.  Undergraduates will be involved extensively              
              in these experiments and will learn state-of-the-art anatomical                
              techniques including ultramicrotomy and electron microscopic (EM)              
              procedures.  This project will not only generate important new                 
              information about how physiological and psychological stressors                
              result in rapid morphological changes in the brain but also                    
              provides an excellent opportunity for students to become exposed               
              to exciting and timely research problem.
