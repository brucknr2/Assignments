Abstract    :
                   A 64 processor nCUBE multicomputer shall be acquired and                  
              dedicated to the support of research in computer and information               
              science and engineering.  The equipment will be used for several               
              research projects to be undertaken by an interdisciplinary group of            
              faculty.                                                                       
                                                                                             
              This equipment supports the proposed projects' common goal of                  
              developing novel parallel methods for advanced engineering                     
              projects.  In particular, the following projects shall be explored:            
                                                                                             
              Asynchronous algorithmic techniques for Computational Fluid Dynamic            
                                                                                             
              Run-time support for data distribution using formal methods                    
                                                                                             
              Parallel-specific algorithms in neural network learning for                    
              Nonlinear Control Systems, Computational Electromagnetics, and                 
              Chemical Process Flowsheeting.                                                 
                                                                                             
              This interdisciplinary project shall bring together applications               
              practitioners and Computer Science researchers.  The equipment is              
              representative of proposed teraflop computers.  thus, the                      
              equipment will be used to develop prototypes of codes that can be              
              scaled to run on larger computing equipment as it becomes                      
              available.  The collective result of this research will be improved            
              technological infrastructure for scientific computation.
