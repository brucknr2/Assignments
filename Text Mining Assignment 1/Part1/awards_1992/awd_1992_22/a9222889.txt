Abstract    :
              This project will complete data analyses and prepare a series of               
              publications on ethics and values in graduate education in four                
              fields:  chemistry, civil engineering, microbiology, and                       
              sociology.  The project, which is co-sponsored by the AAAS                     
              Committee on Scientific Freedom and Responsibility, the Council                
              of Graduate Schools, and Sigma Xi, has been underway since 1987.               
              Major research foci include the nature and transmission of                     
              professional values and ethical standards held by doctoral                     
              students and their faculty and the types of ethical problems and               
              value conflicts that occur in the context of graduate education                
              programs in the four disciplines.  The study's findings and                    
              recommendations will be based on comparative and associational                 
              analyses of four sets of project data:  (1) a 1988 national                    
              survey of graduate school deans concerning university policies                 
              and ethical issues in research and graduate education, (2) a 1990              
              national survey of 2,000 doctoral students enrolled in                         
              departments/programs in the four disciplines at major research                 
              universities, (3) a 1991 survey of 2,000 graduate school faculty               
              in the departments/programs whose students were surveyed in 1990,              
              and (4) a set of 78 in-depth interviews, ranging from 60 to 120                
              minutes, conducted during 1991-1992 with graduate students and                 
              faculty in the four disciplines at eight departments in three                  
              major research universities.
