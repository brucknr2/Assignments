Abstract    :
                                                  9222493  Ganz    Fundamental aspects of
              molecular beam epitaxy of silicon,  germanium/silicon, and details of surface
              diffusion of atoms will  be studied using hot scanning tunneling microscopy. 
              The  instrumentation used and experimental approach followed will  allow atomic
              resolution imaging and electron diffraction to be  measured during the crystal
              growth process.  The effects of  temperature on the kinetics of film growth, as
              well as direct  determination of important growth parameters including 
              anisotropic diffusion, coarsening, binding energies, step  velocity, and
              diffusion across or reflection from step edges will  be studied.  These
              parameters are to be investigated for silicon  homoepitaxial growth on Si(100)
              substrates, and for Ge  heteroepitaxial growth on Si(100) with Sb as a
              surfactant.  %%%   This research is expected to provide fundamental new
              information  about semiconductor materials which are widely used for VLSI 
              technology.  State-of-the-art surface instrumentation and methods  are expected
              to reveal atomic scale features of surface  interactions in real time as
              reactions occur.  The semiconductor  materials under study have wide
              applicability in electronic and  optoelectronic devices, and a greater
              understanding of their  primary materials science properties is expected to
              improve the  performance of devices made from these materials.  New devices 
              and device configurations may result from these studies as well  as significant
              improvements in devices and integrated circuits  currently used in computing,
              information processing, and  telecommunications.  ***
