Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This research involves the investigation of a new king of                      
              reactor system which employs a bed of coal char (pyrolytic                     
              carbon) and microwave (radio frequency - RF) energy to cause a                 
              variety of gas phase reactions to occur catalytically at low                   
              temperatures.  In preliminary work, it has been demonstrated                   
              that such a reactor will produce high purity hydrogen from                     
              methane, isopropyl alcohol from methane and steam, and can                     
              decompose NO, SO2, and H2S.  The system thus shows potential                   
              to produce high-value products from natural gas, and to clean                  
              up hot combustion flue gases and synfuel process gases before                  
              their discharge to the environment.                                            
                                                                                             
              The overall objective is to understand the phenomena involved                  
              in gas phase chemical reactions in the presence of microwave                   
              and pyrolytic carbon.  A series of experiments will be                         
              performed to determine reaction products, reaction mechanisms,                 
              reaction rates, and energy effects (absorption and heating)                    
              when a variety of reactions occur in the presence of microwave                 
              energy.  This is a Small Grant for Exploratory Research and is                 
              meant to determine the feasibility of the process before funds                 
              are committed for an extensive, in-depth study.
