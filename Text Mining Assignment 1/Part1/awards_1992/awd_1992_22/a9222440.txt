                            9222440 Coldren Recently, several novel schemes to provide
              tunable lasers with relative wavelength tuning ranges much larger than the
              achievable index change have been proposed.  Such lasers are desired in high
              capacity wavelength division networks for applications in tele  and data
              communications, and they may find use in optical sensors and memories as well
              as in spectroscopies applications.  Two of the most promising structures have
              been studied at UC Santa Barbara.  Wavelength tuning ranges> 30 nm have been
              demonstrated.  Unfortunately, current funding for this and related programs has
              ended without any renewal prospect due to the sponsoring company's policy. One
              of the problems with such lasers is that they are difficult to directly
              modulate without simultaneously shifting the wavelength. Thus, it is desirable
              to integrate them with separately controlled modulator external to the laser
              cavity.  At UCSB work on a simple and robust guide/antiguide modulator has
              indicated that is an excellent candidate for this function.  Again, funding for
              this work has also ended.  One goal of this proposed program would involve
              integrating this modulator with one of the tunable laser structures.  It is
              shown that this can be accomplished with no extra processing steps.
