Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This is a proposal for a collaboration with two outstanding Russian            
              investigators to study the principal mechanisms of modulation and              
              integration of neuronal networks involved in the control of feeding            
              behavior in the mollusc Clione limacina.  This preparation serves              
              as a model system for posing general questions concerning the                  
              modulation and control of motor output and behavior by the central             
              nervous system.  The mollusc central nervous system is particularly            
              favorable for this study because neuronal networks involved in the             
              control of feeding behavior have been identified.  The main idea is            
              that neuronal networks are not rigidly wired formed by fixed                   
              connections between neurons, but are flexible polyfunctional                   
              structures that generate a broad range of motor outputs.  The                  
              flexibility of the networks is determined by nervous and hormonal              
              inputs that modify the properties of neurons and their connecting              
              synapses.  The properties of single neurons, synaptic connections              
              and the feeding network will be studied by recording the responses             
              of neurons during feeding behavior in the presence and absence of              
              various neuromodulators found in molluscs.***//
