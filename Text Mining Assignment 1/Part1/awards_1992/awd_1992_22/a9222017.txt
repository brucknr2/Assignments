Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  The four specific objectives to be defined are:  (1) the role             
              of melting and subcloud layer evaporation in the creation of lower             
              tropospheric inverted troughs, (2) the effects of surface fluxes,              
              melting, and lower tropospheric evaporation on the structure,                  
              circulation, and amplification of a vortex-bearing mesoscale                   
              convective system, (3) the differences between the large scale                 
              environment of regions that experience numerous mesoscale                      
              convective complexes (MCCs) and the environment of other                       
              convectively-active regions where MCCs rarely occur, and (4) the               
              global characteristics of MCCs and their contribution to the global            
              hydrologic cycle.  The PIs expect to provide understanding of how              
              mesoscale cloud and precipitation processes interact with,                     
              contribute to, and change their large scale environment.//
