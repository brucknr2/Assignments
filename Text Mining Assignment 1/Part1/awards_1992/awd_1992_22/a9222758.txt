Abstract    :
              Government officials commonly face the difficult problem of                    
              having to make important policy decisions in the absence of                    
              perfect information about the ultimate impact of their decisions.              
              Often, those affected most directly by government policy have                  
              better information than the government about the likely impact of              
              policy decisions.  However, those affected by public policy are                
              often reluctant to share their superior information with the                   
              government, because doing so can jeopardize their financial                    
              interests.  The purpose of this research is to examine the                     
              optimal design of public policy in such settings, and to analyze               
              how government policy makers can best elicit and employ superior               
              information held by individuals and firms who will be affected by              
              government policy.                                                             
                                                                                             
              A number of specific settings will be examined.  First, the                    
              question of whether and how the government should identify and                 
              provide special treatment or protection for particular domestic                
              industries in order to improve their international                             
              competitiveness will be explored.  Second, the optimal design of               
              government policy to enhance environmental quality will be                     
              examined.  The proper use of tradeable resource rights will                    
              receive special attention.  Third, optimal regulatory policy for               
              public utilities will be investigated.  Fourth, alternatives to                
              traditional regulatory policy will be analyzed.
