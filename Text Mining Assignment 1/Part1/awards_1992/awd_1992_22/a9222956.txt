Abstract    :
              Scandinavian settlers colonized the islands of the North Atlantic              
              500 years before Columbus. They introduced European economies and              
              culture into fragile Arctic terrestrial and marine ecosystems and              
              over time suffered the consequences of ecological damage, human                
              population decreases and extinctions. The Nordic archaeological,               
              historical and ecological data on these human impacts is unique in             
              the circumpolar world and highly relevant to our understanding of              
              global change. This five year project seeks to coordinate,                     
              integrate and, through case studies, analyze the complex multi-                
              disciplinary data from the North Atlantic region. This effort will             
              greatly enhance the value of individual research projects in 10                
              countries, and is of direct relevance to applied studies of                    
              fisheries and agriculture in the north.
