Abstract    :
              An experimental study at University of California, Berkeley                    
              (UCB), spanning three years, has led to the development of a                   
              Slotted Bolted Connection (SBC), which under cyclic                            
              rectilinear loading exhibits almost ideal elastic-perfectly-                   
              plastic behavior.  This arrangement has provided a cost                        
              effective, predictable and reliable energy dissipator with                     
              possible applications beyond the originally intended area of                   
              seismic design and retrofit.  Analytical studies have shown                    
              that structures equipped with SBCs perform very well under                     
              violent earthquake excitations.  Preparations for shake                        
              table tests of a three story frame at Richmond facility are                    
              currently in progress.  It is expected that the results of                     
              these tests will further affirm the significant utility of                     
              SBCs in earthquake hazard mitigation.  However, it is felt                     
              that in order to bring this project to full fruition, that                     
              is to attain confident acceptance and application by                           
              industry of SBCs, a number of additional tests of SBCs with                    
              bolt sizes other than the 1/2 inch diameter for which                          
              results already exist, and variations in other design                          
              parameters must be conducted.                                                  
                                                                                             
              In this project, additional connections with different bolt                    
              sized, bolt spacing and connection plate sized will be                         
              tested on the existing test facility to obtain more                            
              information of practical importance for utilization of these                   
              connections in steel structures.
