Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              RUI: Studies of Gravitation, the Interstellar Medium, and Pulsars.             
                                                                                             
              Dr. Weisberg will continue investigations in three areas.  (1)                 
              Studies of relativistic gravitation with the first binary pulsar:              
              Continued observations of this pulsar will be used for                         
              investigation of gravitational radiation emission, geodetic spin               
              precession, the constancy of G, and constraints on alternatives to             
              general relativity.  (2) Measurements and analyses of pulsar                   
              distances and the interstellar medium;  21-cm--pulsar absorption               
              spectra will be measured.  These data will be used to study pulsar             
              distances and the neutral hydrogen and free electron distribution              
              and density in the Galaxy.  (3) A pulsar polarimetry and timing                
              survey:  Polarization and timing measurements will be made on 120              
              pulsars at three-month intervals at the Arecibo Observatory.  The              
              output of these observations will be used for studies of pulsar                
              emission mechanisms, pulse morphology, glitches, timing noise, and             
              precession; and, via Faraday rotation measurements, investigations             
              of the galactic magnetic field.  This award is made under the                  
              Research in Undergraduate Institutions (RUI) activity at the NSF.
