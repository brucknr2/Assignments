Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Fishes live in an aquatic medium that is rich in potential                     
              chemical cues.  Soluble chemical products from various parts of a              
              fish's body are known to trigger many forms of social and                      
              symbiotic behavior.  Fish anesthetics that are commonly used for               
              laboratory procedures and to capture fish in the field have long               
              been rumored to have a negative effect on fishes' sense of smell.              
              Limited research on one common anesthetic produced conflicting                 
              results.  There have been no studies of the effects of other                   
              commonly used anesthetics or of any chemical at concentrations                 
              commonly used for field collections.  Many fish behaviorists                   
              could be using test subjects that are deprived of a significant                
              portion of their normal stimulus input.                                        
                                                                                             
              This study will provide an initial indication of the effects of                
              the four most common anesthetics at the strongest concentrations               
              normally used.  The fright reaction of the goby, Asterropteryx                 
              semipunctatus, will be used as a test system.  This reaction can               
              be released, with about equal probability and intensity, by a                  
              chemical cue and a visual cue.  Thus, fish that show impaired                  
              responsiveness to chemical cues can be tested for responsiveness               
              to visual cues to distinguish any general effect on                            
              responsiveness from specific impairment of the chemical senses.
