Abstract    :
              Integrodifference equations are simple discrete-time models that  arise in
              population biology as models for organisms with discrete  nonoverlapping
              generations and well-defined growth and dispersal  stages.  These equations
              possess many of the attributes of  continuous-time reaction-diffusion models. 
              At the same time,  scalar integrodifference equations readily exhibit 
              period-doubling and chaos, and traveling cycles as well as  traveling waves. 
              Systems of integrodifference equations, in  turn, exhibit a new  variety of
              diffusive instability and pattern  formation.  The investigator proposes to
              study the traveling  waves and cycles and the varied spatial patterns that
              arise in  these models, employing a variety of analytical and computational 
              techniques.  Some equations have solutions that show repetitive behavior 
              either in space or in time, developing patterns.  It is of  interest to
              determine under what conditions such pattern  formations can arise.  This
              research will shed light on pattern  formation in general.  The equations
              studied here are related to  models of ecological processes.  Landscape ecology
              is beginning  to investigate how ecological processes generate the complex 
              spatial patterns observed on the landscape and how these  patterns, in turn,
              constrain or determine the rates of the  processes.  The investigator examines
              a fundamental mechanism  that may be responsible for spatial patterns.  The
              project has  practical ramifications in that it may allow for better 
              prediction of the spread of invading riparian plants and invading  insect
              pests.
