Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                                                                                             
                  A major unresolved problem in fisheries oceanography is the               
              mechanism by which water column density stratification affects                 
              growth and survival of larval fish populations.  These initial US              
              GLOBEC field and modeling studies will evaluate the potential                  
              effects of climate change of larval survival due to changes in the             
              stratification process on Georges Bank.  Water column density                  
              stratification has been shown to have a significant influence on               
              the feeding and survival of larval cod and haddock on George Bank              
              by providing a concentrating mechanism for their prey organisms.               
              Changes in wind, precipitation and temperature suggested by climate            
              change models could significantly alter the stratification process             
              on Georges Bank and affect the feeding and survival of larval fish.            
                   This project will involve scientists from NOAA/NMFS, Woods                
              Hole Oceanographic Institution, Bigelow Labs, and the USGS.                    
              Cooperative funding is provided by NOAA, NSF and USGS; the NSF                 
              contribution in FY1992 via this award.
