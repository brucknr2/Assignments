Abstract    :
              This award is for support of a glacial geologic, stratigraphic, and            
              geochronologic study of the limits and timing of Late Weichselian              
              /Holocene glacial and deglacial events on Franz Josef Land, Russia.            
              High resolution satellite imagery will be used to identify study               
              areas; radiocarbon dating of subfossils included in raised beaches             
              of known elevation will provide information on the timing and rate             
              of glacial-isostatic uplift; stratigraphic and sedimentological                
              studies of glacial deposits will provide information on provenance;            
              and integration of field data with isostatic and glaciological                 
              modeling will provide insight into glacial thickness, position of              
              ice divides, domes, and streams and possible response to sea-level             
              rise.  This study will provide new data on Holocene and Late                   
              Weichselian glacial geometry in the Russian Arctic where little                
              data currently exists.
