Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The Pliocene site of Hadar, central Afar, Ethiopia, has been one               
              of                                                                             
              the most productive hominid fossil-bearing sites in the world,                 
              yielding up such  fossils as the Australopithecus afarensis (Lucy              
              and First Family) finds.                                                       
                                                                                             
              The aims of this new phase of the excavations are 1) to refine                 
              the                                                                            
              geochronologic framework of the Hadar Formation, with special                  
              emphasis on the younger sediments; 2) to recover hominid fossils               
              especially from these more recent levels; and 3) to document the               
              paleoenvironments through detailed stratigraphic and                           
              sedimentologic                                                                 
              study.                                                                         
                                                                                             
              There is every expectation that it will be a successful and                    
              productive expedition.
