Abstract    :
              The objective of this workshop is to evaluate the state of                     
              the art of geophysical techniques for use in civil                             
              engineering applications, and to identify areas that need                      
              additional development.                                                        
                                                                                             
              Geophysical methods provide a theoretically sound                              
              means of measuring the mechanical properties of soil and                       
              other civil engineering materials.  An attractive feature of                   
              these methods is that they are nondestructive, and often                       
              non invasive.  There have been several important                               
              developments in geophysical methods in the past decade.                        
              Many recent developments have been made possible by                            
              the increased power and availability of computers.                             
                                                                                             
              Three areas of focus are: (1) Existing analytical  and                         
              numerical methods for wave propagation in near-surface                         
              soils and other engineering materials; (2) new                                 
              applications of geophysical methods in civil engineering;                      
              and (3) to summarize the availability, distribution and                        
              documentation of software, so that engineers can benefit                       
              from recent software developments.
