Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              In recent years, the presence of several novel neuronal                        
              intermediate filament species has been documented.  Dr. Shea has               
              shown that the "66kDa neuronal intermediate filament," also known              
              as alpha-internexin, is constitutively expressed by NB2a/d1 cells,             
              and displays a unique distribution within the neuritic base and                
              axon hillock during differentiation.  Dr. Shea will modulate this              
              protein in cells at various stages of differentiation by two                   
              methods already in use for the study of axonal cytoskeletal                    
              dynamics:  1) inhibiting the translocation, assembly, and                      
              interaction of this neuronal intermediate filament species with                
              other cytoskeletal components, and 2) inhibiting the synthesis of              
              this protein by treating cells with antisense oligonucleotides.                
              Cells will be examined at hourly intervals by phase-contrast                   
              microscopy for alterations in neurite outgrowth, neurite                       
              retraction, compromise of stability, and immunocytochemistry for               
              intracellular localization of the 66kDa neuronal intermediate                  
              filament/alpha-internexin as well as other axonal cytoskeletal                 
              antigens.  These analyses will help determine whether or not NF-66             
              is required for neurite outgrowth, continued elongation, or                    
              stabilization.  Comparison of results obtained following                       
              down-regulation of the 66kDa neuronal intermediate                             
              filament/alpha-internexin with H-200 will provide information                  
              regarding the role played by this novel neuronal intermediate                  
              filament species in axonal outgrowth and maturation.
