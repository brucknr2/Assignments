Abstract    :
                   This research explores connections between initial value                  
              constraints and gauge transformations in classical field                       
              theories.  Initial value analyses of standard examples indicate                
              that (i) the Euler-Lagrange equations are simultaneously                       
              underdetermined and overdetermined; (ii) the (first class)                     
              constraints are given by the vanishing of the energy-momentum map              
              associated to the gauge group; and (iii) the evolution equations               
              can be written in adjoint form.  Noether's theorem and the Dirac-              
              Bergmann analysis of constraints help to predict and explain                   
              these features.  The key tool in the analysis is the                           
              "energy- momentum map."                                                        
                   The general goal of this research is to develop an                        
              understanding of the mathematical structure of physical theories               
              underlying physical entities such as gravitation,                              
              electromagnetism and the nuclear forces.  Recent work has shown                
              that all basic physical processes can be described in a very                   
              similar manner mathematically, and this observation has led to                 
              the discovery of several striking features and phenomena which                 
              yield new insights into these processes.  These insights, in                   
              turn, have generated applications in fields far from removed                   
              their source, such as robotics, optimal control and laser optics.              
              The proposed research will endeavor to unify and extend current                
              approaches, based on geometric and symmetry considerations,                    
              thereby obtaining a fundamentally new understanding of the                     
              structure of physical theories.
