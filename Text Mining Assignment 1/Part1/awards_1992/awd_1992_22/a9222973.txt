Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This project studies the formation of policies that affect                     
              international trade and the global environment.  While the trade               
              literature has devoted much attention to identifying policies that             
              maximize aggregate welfare, relatively little effort has been made             
              to understand what policies will emerge from a realistic political             
              process in which policy makers must respond to the demands of both             
              special interests and the general electorate.  A political economy             
              model has been developed in which elected officials respond to                 
              political incentives.  This model will be extended and applied to              
              consider such problems as the equilibrium structure of protection,             
              the government's choice of trade policy instrument, the interaction            
              between trade and environmental policies (and between the interest             
              groups that support these two types of interventions), and the                 
              interaction between governments of different countries in both                 
              cooperative and noncooperative settings.                                       
                                                                                             
              The ultimate aim of the research is to evaluate alternative                    
              institutional "rules of the game" for the world trading system.  It            
              is hoped that rules will be identified that will facilitate a                  
              liberal trading regime with greatest mutual benefits from trade and            
              with efficient cooperation on international environmental matters.             
              In order to accomplish this, the theoretical framework must first              
              be developed and refined so that emerging policy outcomes can be               
              predicted under different possible institutional constraints.
