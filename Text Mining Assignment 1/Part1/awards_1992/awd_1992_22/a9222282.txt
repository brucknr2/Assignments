Abstract    :
              This award will fund Undergraduate Design Projects to develop                  
              custom software and/or devices for persons with either mental or               
              physical disabilities.  The students will work with institutions               
              providing care or training for the targeted populations and will               
              provide written reports on the projects completed each year.                   
                                                                                             
              This type of undertaking is important since not only will it                   
              provide meaningful projects for engineering students to complete               
              as part of their education, but it will also benefit a population              
              where customization is usually required to increase the                        
              usefulness of the device and/or software.
