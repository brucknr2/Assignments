Abstract    :
              An interdisciplinary group of scholars at Cornell University and               
              Carleton University, Canada, has initiated a joint project on                  
              "Global Environmental Change and Social Justice."  The Social                  
              Science Research Council is co-sponsoring the project, and it is               
              administered by the Peace Studies Program at Cornell.  In a                    
              series of three workshops and a final conference scheduled for                 
              September 1993, participants will examine in depth the ethical                 
              issues posed by global environmental change and national and                   
              international policy choices.  Issues to be covered include the                
              moral standing of the environment, the role of science in framing              
              environmental issues, the competing claims of different levels of              
              community, and the ethical problems posed by environmental                     
              refugees and resettlement policies.  These issues have been                    
              relatively neglected in the general discourse on environmental                 
              change.  This project will begin to elucidate a framework for                  
              making practical ethical judgments about environmental issues and              
              to link that framework to discussions of the politics of global                
              environmental change.  Selected papers from the workshops and                  
              conference will be published in an edited book.
