Abstract    :
              The purpose of this proposal is to better understand the                       
              interrelationships of protein structure, stability,  and dynamics              
              using T4 lysozyme as a model.  This moderate sized protein of 164              
              residues has a known 3-dimensional crystal structure.  The                     
              protein has two structural domains and no natural disulfide bonds.             
              Many mutants exist that modulate its thermodynamic                             
              stability and more than 100 mutant crystal structures have been                
              determined by Brian Matthews' laboratory at the University of                  
              Oregon.  We have assigned the amide resonances of the wild type and            
              several mutant proteins using modern nuclear magnetic                          
              resonance techniques (NMR).  We propose to use these methods to                
              investigate (1) the ionization behavior of the 19 carboxyl groups              
              of the protein with the goal of understanding electrostatic and                
              polarity effects in the protein; (2) the dynamics of the folded                
              state; (3) determine the role in the folding pathway of an early               
              folding intermediate which was detected as a result of the                     
              protection to hydrogen exchange it afforded a limited set of                   
              amides; (4) complete the assignments of the sidechain resonances               
              with the goal of determining the solution structure of the                     
              protein.                                                                       
              %%%                                                                            
              The linear amino acid sequence of a protein determines the                     
              complex three-dimensional shape that  protein acquires in                      
              solution.  This proposal investigates how that linear information              
              is used to fold the protein into its three-dimensional structure.              
              We will investigate:  (1) the role of charge-charge interactions in            
              stabilizing the folded state, (2) the rigidity of the folded state,            
              (3) the time course of the conversion of a random,                             
              unfolded polymer chain into the final folded state, and (4) the                
              structure, in solution, of the final folded state.
