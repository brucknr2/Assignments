Abstract    :
              The study will examine the                                                     
              hydrologic conditions prevailing in                                            
              the Oakland Hills before the                                                   
              October 1991 fire which took the                                               
              life of 25 people, injured 150                                                 
              others, destroyed nearly 4,000                                                 
              homes and caused about $1 billion                                              
              property loss.  The preceding                                                  
              hydrologic and climatic conditions,

              impact of the fire on the local                                                
              watersheds are some issues that                                                
              will be examined.  The research                                                
              will take advantage of a rare                                                  
              opportunity and its results will                                               
              benefit the natural hazard research                                            
              community by providing a better
