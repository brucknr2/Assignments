Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Dr.  Benz  will  investigate  two  main  themes  in  computational             
              astrophysics:    the  modeling  of  stellar  collisions  and the               
              simulation of hydrodynamical behavior in supernova explosions. He              
              will use a 3-D Smooth Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) computer code               
              to extend previous work on stellar collisions and disruptions to               
              include encounters involving main sequence stars of unequal mass               
              and compact objects.  The long range goal is to obtain cross-                  
              sections for merging, mass-loss and binary formation for all                   
              possible stellar encounters.  Knowledge of these cross-sections is             
              an essential ingredient for models of the evolution of globular                
              cluster cores and active galactic nuclei.  The need for a better               
              understanding  of  hydrodynamical  instabilities  occurring  in                
              supernova explosions has been demonstrated by the unexpected early             
              detection of x-rays from SN1987A.  Dr. Benz will also study the                
              subsonic flame propagation and off-center ignition in type Ia                  
              supernova.                                                                     
                                                                                             
              Because SPH is a relatively new method to solve the hydrodynamical             
              equations, emphasis in this study is given to comparisons between              
              results from SPH and state-of-the-art finite difference methods.               
              The various tests envisioned go far beyond the usual simple shock              
              tube problem and will deal with complicated multidimensional flows.            
              This should provide a better understanding of the capabilities of              
              SPH at a time when this method is becoming increasingly popular.
