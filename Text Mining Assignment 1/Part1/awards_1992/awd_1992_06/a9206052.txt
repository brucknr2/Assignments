Abstract    :
                   This project will continue to research of an interdisciplinary            
              team to establish an accurate theoretical model of the electrical              
              double layer at the surface of 2:1 clay minerals suspended in 1-1              
              and 2-1 electrolyte solutions.  The research proposed has become               
              feasible recently because of important, new results obtained by the            
              Principal Investigators and other researchers.  The renewal project            
              objectives are:                                                                
                                                                                             
                   (I) To perform Monte Carlo simulations of the ion                         
              distributions in a 1-1 electrolyte near the surface of a 2:1 clay              
              mineral, including fully molecular-scale water-water, water-ion,               
              and ion-ion interactions.                                                      
                                                                                             
                   (II) To perform statistical mechanical calculations of the                
              interactions ("swelling pressure") between planar charged surfaces             
              immersed in 1-1, 2-1, and 1-2-1 electrolyte solutions.                         
                                                                                             
                   The results obtained will provide a significantly-improved,               
              quantitative foundation for the surface chemistry of 2:1 clay                  
              minerals as it occurs typically in mineral weathering and                      
              diagenesis.
