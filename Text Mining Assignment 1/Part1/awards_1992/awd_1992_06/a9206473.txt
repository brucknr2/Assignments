Abstract    :
                This research is to measure shear-wave splitting in western                  
              North America to infer alignment of olivine in the mantle and                  
              associated mantle flow patterns.  These patterns have                          
              implications on lithospheric deformation, absolute plate motion                
              and associated earthquake hazards.  In this continuation of an                 
              ongoing study, an improvement in the ability to handle two                     
              anisotropic layers will be made by inverting a suite of                        
              seismograms directly for the anisotropic parameters.  The derived              
              thicknesses can then be compared with those independently                      
              determined by means of teleseismic P and S time residuals.  This               
              research is a component of the National Earthquake Hazard                      
              Reduction Program.
