Abstract    :
                   This award supports basic research in nuclear theory                      
              carried out by Professors D-H. Feng and M. Vallieres at Drexel                 
              University.  The main focus is on understanding nuclear                        
              structure phenomena both in terms of the group theoretical                     
              based Fermion Dynamical Symmetry Model and a newly developed                   
              shell-model code.  Work will be done on the properties of                      
              super-deformed nuclei and nuclei far from stability.
