Abstract    :
              This work addresses a long-standing problem in using large water               
              samplers at sea where the terminal velocity of the sampler sinking             
              through the water column is less than the wire to which it is                  
              attached.  Without careful management and complex motion                       
              compensation devices, data can be degraded, and excessive snap                 
              loads can develop causing the cable to break.  This project will               
              involve mechanical design, prototype construction and testing of a             
              water sampler attachment mechanism that will decouple the                      
              underwater instrument package from its wire during descent.  The               
              sampler will be allowed to free-fall at its natural, and constant              
              terminal velocity, independent of the hydrographic wire's ship-                
              induced movement.  Once at full depth, a mechanical device will                
              firmly couple the instrument package to the wire for retrieval back            
              to the surface.  A constant and predicable descent rate through the            
              water column will improve the quality of oceanographic data and                
              lessen the chance of losing instruments from cable management                  
              problems.  This work has a direct bearing and use on several global            
              geoscience research initiatives.
