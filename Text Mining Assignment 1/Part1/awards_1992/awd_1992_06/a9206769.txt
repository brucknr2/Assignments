Abstract    :
                   Professor Payne and his colleagues will establish an optical              
              multiphoton spectroscopy laboratory at Georgia Southern                        
              University.  This grant will fund the purchase of equipment to                 
              begin the laboratory.  This research will involve undergraduates               
              and is funded under the RUI (research at undergraduate                         
              institution) program of NSF.
