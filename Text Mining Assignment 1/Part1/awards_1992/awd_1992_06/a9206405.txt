Abstract    :
                   The underlying hypothesis of this research is that those firms            
              that utilize an internal capability to design a major part of their            
              own manufacturing technology will have competitive advantages that             
              can be identified and ascribed to this strategy.  The objective of             
              this research is to investigate and test this hypothesis.  The                 
              research plan includes field studies of the use of in-house                    
              capabilities to develop and build new manufacturing technology and             
              the development and implementation for survey mechanisms to serve              
              as benchmarks for the United States' performance in this area.                 
                  The project is an exploratory step toward a full-scale                     
              cooperative research program that will study the concept of                    
              proprietary process technology design and manufacturing in the                 
              United States, Europe and Japan.
