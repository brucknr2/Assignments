Abstract    :
              Awards resulting from earlier versions of this proposal dating back            
              to July, '88, were in large part for the development of a SRIMS                
              technique for the isotopic analysis of Os, using Lamont's new                  
              Isolab 54 mass spectrometer.  But after 1990 when the NTIMS was                
              shown to be better, this is what has been used in the PI's lab.                
              Efforts during the proposed funding period will involve Re-Os                  
              investigations of ancient crustal rocks, mantle-derived                        
              peridotites, and modern mantle-derived volcanics.  The goals are               
              to: 1) investigate the extent to which old cratonic rocks represent            
              intracrustal "recycling" of even older continental materials; 2)               
              establish the present state of Os isotopic heterogeneity in the                
              modern mantle; and 3) characterize Re and Os distributions on                  
              mineralogical scales in both crustal and mantle rocks.
