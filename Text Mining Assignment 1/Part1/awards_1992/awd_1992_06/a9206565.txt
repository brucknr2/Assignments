Abstract    :
                This research is to deploy 20 three-component broadband                      
              seismometers, most of which will come from the PASSCAL program, to             
              study variation in the physical properties of the crust and upper              
              mantle beneath the eastern Snake River Plain region.  This region              
              shows the results of a mantle hot spot crossing the continent with             
              associated volcanic and earthquake activity.  Tomographic imaging              
              of the P- and S-wave velocities and attenuation will be used to                
              outline the thermal and partial melt structure of the hot spot                 
              plume in the crust and upper mantle.  Shear-wave splitting will be             
              used to study anisotropy and implied mantle flow structure.  This              
              research is a component of the National Earthquake Hazard Reduction            
              Program.
