Abstract    :
                   This award will provide two-thirds of the funding needed to               
              acquire optical microscopy equipment that will be housed in the                
              Department of Geological Sciences at Southern Methodist University.            
              The University is committed to providing the remaining funds                   
              necessary for the acquisition.                                                 
                   The optical equipment to be acquired consists of a Nomarski               
              differential interference contrast system which is particularly                
              useful in the study of microscopic textural features of rock-                  
              forming minerals such as compositional zoning and dissolution                  
              surfaces in volcanic rocks. The Principal Investigator, colleagues,            
              and students in the Department of Geological Sciences at Southern              
              Methodist University are engaged in basic research on the growth               
              of volcanos and the record of their growth as seen in the                      
              microscopic details of crystal growth patterns in lava.
