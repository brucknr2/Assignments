Abstract    :
              This project will define the stratigraphy and extent of the major              
              volcaniclastic units and analyze their textures, facies, and                   
              depositional characteristics of the ignimbrites and related surge              
              and lahar deposits.  Combination of data from the reworked and                 
              primary deposits will allow interpretation of the history of                   
              explosive volcanism and catastrophic sedimentation, including                  
              pyroclastic flow-lahar transitions.  The study will yield data                 
              pertinent to several unusual and important problems:  1) Caldera               
              development in the Taal magmatic system.  2) The nature of mafic               
              ignimbrites, their shallow submarine equivalents, and transitions              
              to sediment gravity flows. 3) The emplacement mechanisms of                    
              widespread surge-like deposits that have previously been attributed            
              to base surges.  A by-product of the geological information gained,            
              and the collaboration with PHIVOLCS, will be an improved                       
              understanding of volcanic and related hazards for the Greater                  
              Manila region.
