Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Program Summary:                                                               
                                                                                             
              This is a joint proposal from PI's at SIO and at Woods Hole                    
              Oceanographic Institution (WHOI) to develop improved seawater                  
              profiling and sampling systems.  Each of the three proposals in the            
              joint package addresses a particular problem with current water                
              sampling devices.  In this proposal, the PI proposes a one-year                
              development program to design, construct and test an improved water            
              sampling bottle and an improved CTD controller.  The proposed                  
              design changes for the water sampling bottles are necessary to                 
              reduce contamination of water samples and to permit more efficient             
              water sampling and use of shiptime.  Such improvements would                   
              benefit sampling programs to be conducted during the WOCE                      
              hydrographic cruises.  //
