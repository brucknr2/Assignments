Abstract    :
                 This project is focused on the regulatory cascade that                      
              culminates in the activation of ion transport in the giant                     
              internodal cell of Chara corallina. Upon illumination, ion                     
              transport activity in these cells rapidly becomes spatially                    
              segregated into alternating bands of what appears to be proton                 
              influx and efflux. Experiments are aimed at discerning the                     
              potential role of protein dephosphorylation in the activation of               
              the transport system and in the rapid spatial segregation of ion               
              movement activities.                                                           
              %%%                                                                            
                 The movement of ions across the plasma membrane of plant cells              
              is under strict regulatory control and is responsive to a variety              
              of extracellular signals. The giant internodal cell from Chara                 
              corallina provides a unique model system for the study of these                
              regulatory cascades because ion movement is triggered by light and             
              appears to be coupled directly to photosynthetic activity. The                 
              intermediary steps in signal transduction are not well understood              
              and are part of the focus for this project. The transduction of                
              these signals can provide important clues to mechanisms by which               
              plant cells regulate transport at the plasma membrane.
