Abstract    :
                     Due to the dynamics of plate interactions, deformation and              
              fabrics resulting from deformation are expected to form                        
              sequentially and diachronously across an orogen.  However, it has              
              been difficult to directly date deformation fabrics sufficiently               
              accurately to detect the propagation of deformation.  This project             
              will utilize an area in the western Alps where temperature during              
              deformation remained low so that the fabric-forming common white               
              mica should have refrained radiogenic argon.  The work will attempt            
              to date deformation in four basement-cored nappes of the Grand                 
              Saint-Bernard Nappe complex.  Results should distinguish between               
              cooling ages and deformation ages, thus providing the basis for a              
              very detailed tectonic interpretation of the progress of fabric                
              development during orogenesis.
