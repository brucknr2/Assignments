Abstract    :
                   Effros, Popa, and Takesaki will continue their investigations             
              into operator algebra theory and its applications which can be                 
              phrased as "Quantized Analysis."  Quantized Analysis is a key to               
              understanding quantum phenomenon in mathematics and physics.                   
              Effros will continue his study of operator space analysis which is             
              essential for building an analytic theory of quantum groups.  Popa             
              will continue his work on subfactor analysis based on his                      
              successful classification of amenable subfactors.  Takesaki will               
              continue his project on the cocycle conjugacy analysis of group                
              actions on von Neumann algebras.                                               
                   The general area of mathematics of this project has its basis             
              in the theory of algebras of Hilbert space operators.  Operators               
              can be thought of as finite or infinite matrices of complex                    
              numbers.  Special types of operators are often put together in an              
              algebra, naturally called an operator algebra.  These abstract                 
              objects have a surprising variety of applications.  For example,               
              they play a key role in knot theory, which in turn is  currently               
              being used to study the structure of DNA, and they are of                      
              fundamental importance in noncommutative geometry, which is                    
              becoming increasingly important in physics.
