Abstract    :
              This research, with work completed earlier, will provide a detailed            
              analysis of the paleoecology of Cenozoic Central America using a               
              series of fossil beds that are extremely rich in pollen.  Cores                
              will be sampled from each of two sites---one in southern Mexico and            
              one on Puerto Rico.  This study will complement data collected from            
              other sites in the Caribbean and Isthmus regions.  The data and the            
              derived inferences will have great implications for understanding              
              the effect of large-scale global change on the dynamics of                     
              vegetation, and the effects of those changes on animal populations             
              and climate itself.  Specifically, the results will be instrumental            
              in understanding the origin and migration of floras during the                 
              closure of the Pan-American land mass.  This event is crucial to               
              comprehending the modern floras and faunas of the New World, and it            
              has significance for biogeography, systematics, ecology, etc.
