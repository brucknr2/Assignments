Abstract    :
                   A Dark Matter Workshop will be held February 14-16, 1992                  
              at the University of Florida.  The workshop will bring                         
              together workers from several backgrounds to discuss the                       
              nature of the non-luminous matter in the universe.  The                        
              discussion will consider the observational evidence for this                   
              non-luminous matter, its nature, and prospects for direct                      
              detection of dark-matter particles.                                            
                   The nature of the dark matter is one of the outstanding                   
              riddles in astrophysics.  A workshop bringing together                         
              theorists, experimentalists, and astronomical observers to                     
              consider the problem is an important step.
