Abstract    :
              By thorough examination of the spatial variations in textures,                 
              mineralogy and chemistry in a few recent, well-characterized ash               
              flow sheets, the PIs will be able to determine the systematics of              
              devitrification and vapor- phase alteration and to develop a model             
              for these processes that will allow them to predict their role in              
              element redistribution.  These textures are usually too                        
              fine-grained to be adequately characterized by standard optical                
              petrography, therefore 'nanopetrography' studies will be performed             
              using analytical transmission electron microscopy (TEM) in addition            
              to standard mineralogical methods of characterization, in order to             
              determine the mechanics and systematics of devitrification and                 
              vapor-phase alteration.  These studies should lead to three                    
              seperate publications, providing significant new information on the            
              evolution of silicic volcanic rocks.
