Abstract    :
                 The Department of Mathematics at North Dakota State                         
              University, Fargo will purchase a workstaion, computer algebra                 
              software, and ancillary computing equipment which will be                      
              dedicated to the support of research in mathematical sciences.                 
              The equipment will be used for research on commuting varieties of              
              Lie algebras.
