Abstract    :
              This proposal presents an experimental plan to investigate                     
              biological mechanisms to defend against activated forms of oxygen              
              in soybean root nodules.  This defense is centered on the 4 enzymes            
              of the ascorbate-glutathione pathway in wich H2O2 is scavenged.                
              Biochemical studies will concentrate on glutathione reductase.                 
              This enzyme will be purified and characterized with regard to amino            
              acid sequence, kinetic properties, pH optimum, inhibitor effects,              
              cofactor requirements, substrate specificity, pI values, and                   
              possible isozymes.  Polyclonal antibodies will be used to                      
              immunologically characterize the enzyme and to determine the                   
              subcellular location with electron microscopy.                                 
                                                                                             
              A major component of the proposed work consists of molecular                   
              studies to 1) identify the biochemical mechanisms that regulate the            
              genes encoding glutathione reductase and ascorbate peroxidase and              
              2) describe environomental and developmental factors that affect               
              regulation.  The genes for glutathione reductase and ascorbate                 
              peroxidase will be cloned in order to identify regulatory sites and            
              study cis- and trans-acting factors involved in express.  The                  
              regulatory role of various environmental factors (water stress,                
              heat and chilling shock, pO2) and of potential biochemical                     
              effectors (GSH, H2O2, paraquat, rhizobiol signals) will be                     
              examined.  These studies will involved analysis of transcript and              
              protein levels in whole nodules and in soybean protoplasts bearing             
              electroporated reporter genes fused to promoter regions.  A long               
              term goal is to assess the criticality of oxygen defense through               
              use of transgenic plants bearing antisense genes.
