Abstract    :
              An investigation of the factors which govern the rate and                      
              efficiency of electron transfer reactions will be conducted.                   
              The effect of spacers separating donor and acceptor groups will                
              be evaluated by measuring photoinduced charge separation rate                  
              constants and emission spectra as a function of temperature and                
              calculating free energies of electron transfer. Picosecond                     
              photocalorimetry will be used to evaluate enthalpy and volume                  
              changes which occur upon electron transfer. Finally,                           
              through-solvent electron coupling and its impact upon electron                 
              transfer will be investigated in structurally rigid molecules.                 
              Correlations between transfer rate constants, electronic                       
              coupling matrix elements, and solvent band structure will be                   
              analyzed.                                                                      
              %%%                                                                            
              A process which is common to a large number of chemical                        
              reactions is the rapid transfer of electrons. With this grant                  
              from the Organic Dynamics Program, Profssor Matthew Zimmt of                   
              Brown University will investigate the factors which govern the                 
              rate of electron transfer processes which are complete within a                
              few trillionths of a second. The parameters which influence                    
              electron transfer will be investigated using molecules                         
              specially designed so that both the distance between donor and                 
              acceptor groups and the identity and positions of the                          
              intervening atoms are well-defined. The results of the study                   
              may make it possible to design molecular systems which will                    
              maximize electron transfer efficiency.
