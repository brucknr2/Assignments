Abstract    :
                   This research will be on the nutational and deformational                 
              responses of the Earth to lunisolar perturbations, and on                      
              geophysical phenomena which affect these reposes; it will consist              
              of theoretical investigations, as well as analyses related to                  
              space-geodetic data.  The primary goals are, firstly, to obtain                
              more accurate knowledge of the Earth's structure and properties,               
              especially those relating to the fluid outer and solid inner cores,            
              and secondly, to apply this knowledge to derive accurate formulae,             
              including the effects of mantle anelasticity, ocean tides, etc.,               
              for nutation amplitudes and tidal parameters.  The theoretical                 
              studies will take advantage of the developments in the theory of               
              nutations including the influence of inner core dynamics, and in               
              the formulation of the tidal deformation problem in computationally            
              efficient form.
