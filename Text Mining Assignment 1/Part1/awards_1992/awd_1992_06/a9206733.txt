Abstract    :
              As AI planning systems are applied to more realistic problems, the             
              issue of choosing among alternative plans arises.  The planner                 
              typically cannot prove that any alternative will or will not be                
              successful, and so it much choose among plans on the basis of how              
              likely they are to achieve their aims and how efficiently they do              
              so.  Decision theory supplies a normative model for making these               
              choices, but is not directly applicable to the planning problem as             
              AI has posed it, and more importantly does not provide a                       
              computational framework within which to make the choices.  In                  
              particular, decision theory offers no advice on how to generate or             
              modify plans.  Decision theory and symbolic AI planning algorithms             
              therefore offer complementary strengths: the former provides a rich            
              representation for expressing choice among alternatives and a                  
              theory of how to make those choices rationally; the latter provides            
              a computational method for generating and improving plans, but                 
              under restrictive assumptions.  The two approaches will be                     
              integrated to produce a practical decision-theoretic planner.  The             
              research contains theoretical and computational; aspects, the                  
              former oriented toward reconciling the decision-theoretic and AI               
              problem representations, the latter oriented toward developing an              
              algorithm that efficiently builds, evaluated, and chooses among                
              plan alternatives.
