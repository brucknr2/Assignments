Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              It was recently discovered that, in the rat, the amounts of a                  
              particular protein, the K-ras p21 protein, contained in the ovary              
              mirror the pattern of secretion of progesterone from the corpus                
              luteum. Furthermore, when an antibody against this protein was                 
              incorporated into luteal cell in vitro, progesterone secretion from            
              these cells was significantly decreased, thus demonstrating that               
              this protein plays a role in the production/secretion of                       
              progesterone by the luteal cell. It is the objective of this                   
              proposal to determine the specific way in which the K-ras p21                  
              protein affects luteal progesterone secretion and to determine                 
              whether this p21 protein plays a role in the secretion of other                
              hormones from the luteum. The K-ras p21 protein is present in all              
              mammalian cells. Thus, the results of the proposed studies will                
              have a significant impact upon the understanding of ovarian hormone            
              secretory mechanisms as well as our understanding of the ways in               
              which all mammalian cells respond to hormones and growth factors.
