Abstract    :
                   In a telecommunication system, the denial of service requests             
              according to customer type or systems state, even when excess                  
              capacity exists, can improve system performance.  Finding good call            
              admission policies is therefore an important part of system design.            
                   The principal investigators (PIs) propose a probabilistic                 
              algorithm to search for call admission policies in                             
              telecommunications systems.  Such a procedure decouples policy                 
              evaluation from policy search and in this way allows consideration             
              of problems which seem intractable using analytic methods.  The                
              policies found are expected to yield insight which will allow                  
              useful analytic approximations to be employed.  As a case in point,            
              the PIs considered the M/M/c/c queue with two customer classes.                
              The search procedure was able to find nearly optimal solutions                 
              whose structure strongly suggested the known optimal policy                    
              structure.  It is proposed that this study be extended first to                
              other simple systems which appear frequently at communications                 
              systems models and then to specific problems in the fields of                  
              mobile communications an high speed networks.
