Abstract    :
                   Recent U/TH and 14C measurements by Bard et al. (1990) on                 
              corals from Barbados have indicated that 20,000 years ago the                  
              activity of 14C in the atmosphere was approximately 50% higher than            
              the modern activity.  They ascribed this increase in activity to               
              enhanced 14C productions due to more intense cosmic radiation as               
              a result of a weaker terrestrial dipole magnetic field.  We propose            
              to test this origin for the 14C enhancement by reconstructing the              
              deposition of another cosmogenic radionuclide, 36C1.  A similar                
              enhancement of the 36C1 would demonstrate that both nuclides were              
              responding to production fluctuations.  We propose to sample                   
              atmospheric 36C1 preserved in fossil packrat (Neotoma) urine in an             
              arid site in western Nevada.  This site contains a midden that has             
              been 14C dated to cover the time interval 29,000 to 3,000 years                
              before present.  If strong correlation of the 36C1 and the Barbados            
              14C records is found, the 36C1 data might help to reconstruct                  
              atmospheric 14C activity during the period 30,000 to 20,000 years              
              B.P., for which other data are scarce.  We will also compare                   
              36C1/C1 ratios in midden samples from western Nevada and other                 
              widely spread localities with meteoric 36C1 ratios in the same                 
              localities in order to establish the relationship between the rat              
              urine and soil-water 36C1.  In addition to addressing the problem              
              of secular variations in cosmogenic nuclide production, the record             
              of variation in meteoric 36C1 may provide a valuable dating agent              
              for goundwater and soil water.
