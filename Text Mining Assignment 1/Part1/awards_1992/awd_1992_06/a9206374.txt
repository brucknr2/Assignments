Abstract    :
                   This award supports the research of Professor R. Stanley and              
              Professor G.C. Rota to work in combinatorics.  Professor Stanley               
              intends to work on Schubert polynomials and the connection between             
              subdivisions and local h-vectors.  Professor Rota will work on the             
              umbral calculus and invariant theory.                                          
                   The research is in the general area of combinatorics.                     
              Combinatorics attempts to find efficient methods to study how                  
              discrete collections of objects can be organized.  And, so it is               
              extremely important to modern communications, for example the                  
              design of large networks as in telephone systems and the design of             
              algorithms in computer science.
