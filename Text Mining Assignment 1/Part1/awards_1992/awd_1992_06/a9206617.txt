Abstract    :
                   This award will provide 58% of the funds required to purchase             
              a cathodoluminescence (CL) microscope system for research and                  
              teaching use in the Department of Geological Sciences at the                   
              University of Tennessee-Knoxville. The University is committed to              
              providing the remaining funds needed for the acquisition of this               
              equipment.                                                                     
                   The CL technique (inducing luminescence by electron                       
              bombardment of the microscopic target) is useful in bringing out               
              features otherwise invisible during microscopy of geological                   
              samples. The Principal Investigator and colleagues in the                      
              Department of Geological Sciences are involved in research on rocks            
              that have been tectonically deformed, on ancient soil profiles, and            
              on processes of rock-fluid chemical interactions during rock                   
              metamorphism. In all of these studies the CL method is a necessary             
              tool for detecting microscopic mineralogical changes used to                   
              interpret geological processes.
