              acquisition of an X-ray diffractometer system that will be                     
              installed and operated in the Department of Marine Geology and                 
              Geophysics at the Rosenstiel School of Marine and Atmospheric                  
              Sciences in the University of Miami. The University of Miami is

                   A modern X-ray diffractometer system is needed at this                    
              institution as an integral part of many of its research projects               
              in carbonate sedimentation, analysis of samples from the Ocean                 
              Drilling Program, hydrology, paleoclimatology, and paleontology.
