Abstract    :
                   Instructional simulation software for undergraduate                       
              quantum or modern physics will be developed.  It will                          
              introduce the time-dependent Schrodinger equation in a simple                  
              discrete form to do many intuition-building real-time                          
              simulations.  The software will allow students to see directly                 
              that the Schrodinger equation governs real-world phenomena                     
              such as resonant absorption of electromagnetic waves.  This                    
              intuitive background will make it much easier for a student to                 
              understand the formal theory of the Schrodinger equation as a                  
              partial differential equation.  The software will be a                         
              general-purpose one- and two-dimensional time-dependent                        
              Schrodinger solver, based on a new fast and accurate                           
              algorithm.                                                                     
                   This software will be of immediate use in upper-level                     
              physics courses.
