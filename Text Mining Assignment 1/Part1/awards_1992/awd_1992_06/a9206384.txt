Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This award provide funds to assist in bringing together a                      
              diverse group of international scientists and engineers                        
              working in the area of adhesion.  Adhesion's pervasive role in                 
                                                                                             
              areas as diverse as structural materials, biomaterials,                        
              membranes, and protective coatings, to name only a few, has                    
              come to be widely appreciated in recent years.  The interest                   
              in adhesion as a science has been spurred by two developments.                 
                                                                                             
              One has been the growth in techniques to manipulate surfaces                   
              and interfaces in multiphase materials systems, with                           
              significant improvement in the overall behavior of such                        
              systems.  The other has been the rapid progress in molecular                   
              and atomic level characterization of surfaces and interfaces.                  
                                                                                             
              Still being developed is a thorough understanding of how                       
              molecular or atomic level details at the interface between the                 
                                                                                             
              adhering phases are related to the macroscopic performance                     
              characteristics.  Correspondingly, the construction of a                       
              complete and general theory of adhesion is still in process.                   
              To achieve this goal, several scientists need to exchange not                  
              only results, but ideas.  They need to challenge each other,                   
              teach each other, and develop insights from one another.  This                 
                                                                                             
              can be best accomplished by an extended period of personal                     
              interaction.  The Gordon Conference, providing a week of close                 
                                                                                             
              contact among scientists, is one of the few venues that                        
              provides the required face-to-face interaction.
