Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              A maternal effect influencing DNA endoreduplication activity in the            
              developing endosperm of maize has been observed in data generated              
              by flow cytometric techniques.  The overall objective of this                  
              project is to expand the information concerning these maternal                 
              effects in the developing endosperm.  Specifically, tests will be              
              made to determine: (1) the extent of the maternal effects in                   
              reciprocal crosses among a wide range of inbreds; (2) the precise              
              characteristic(s) that are governed by the maternal effects; and               
              (3) the role of these maternal effects in the cytokinetics of the              
              developing endosperm.  Flow cytometric analyses of endosperm will              
              be obtained from a diallel pattern of parents and F1 reciprocal                
              crosses at the peak of endoreduplication activity and at closely               
              spaced intervals over an extended developmental period.                        
              Brd/Urd/monoclonal antibody techniques in conjunction with an in               
              vitro ear culture system will be used to determine the role of                 
              maternal effects upon cell cycle phases and DNA replication rates.             
              The information could lead to new ideas about DNA replication, cell            
              cycle timing, genome interaction, and even combining ability and               
              hybrid vigor.  The possibility exists that such information might              
              eventually be used in a predictive manner for the selection of                 
              parents for hybridization.
