Abstract    :
                   The principal investigator will develop frequency domain                  
              techniques to study uniform stability and robust stability for                 
              distributed parameter control systems.  These techniques will be               
              used to study several stabilization questions for mechanical                   
              system models.                                                                 
                   Control theory deals with the theoretical aspects of                      
              understanding how complex systems learn about its environment,                 
              process the information to reduce uncertainty, plan, generate and              
              execute control actions.  It has played a major role in many                   
              areas of science and engineering.
