Abstract    :
                   We propose to test and extend existing sequence stratigraphic             
              and sedimentological interpretations of rocks of Neoproterozoic to             
              earliest Cambrian age in the Adelaide geosyncline, South Australia.            
              Sequence stratigraphy provides an independent method for                       
              significantly improving intro-basinal correlation in sparsely                  
              fossiliferous rocks, and a physical context in which to analyze                
              biostratigraphic, chemostratigraphic, magnetostratigraphic and                 
              geochronological data.  To the extent that the waxing and waning of            
              Neoproterozoic ice sheets must have influenced sea level, we infer             
              that at least some of the most persistent sequence boundaries are              
              of global extent.  This possibility needs to tested against the                
              emerging stratigraphic record in key sections.  The Adelaide                   
              geosyncline was selected as a reference section for sequence                   
              stratigraphic research on the basis of its great thickness (15 km),            
              quality of outcrop, limited deformation and metamorphism,                      
              availability of seismic and core data in adjacent basins of the                
              same age, varied biota (including acritarchs, trace fossils,                   
              Ediacara assemblage metazoa, and stromatolites), and amenability to            
              stable isotope geochemistry.  There is some potential also for U-Pb            
              geochronology of ash beds, and we propose to search systematically             
              for such layers.  The proposed research will be co-ordinated with              
              the work of others under the umbrella of Project 320 of the                    
              International Geological Correlation Programme (Neoproterozoic                 
              Events and Resources), with the long-term objective of documenting             
              and evaluating the connections between a variety of biological,                
              environmental and tectonic phenomena recorded in younger                       
              Neoproterozoic rocks.
