Abstract    :
                   The principal investigators will conduct research in various              
              aspects of dynamical systems. The investigators will concentrate               
              primarily on low dimensional systems. In particular they will                  
              study attractors for unimodal maps of the interval, determination              
              of asymptotic properties of the renormalization operator, and the              
              problem of topological exponential maps. They will also consider               
              iterations of homeomorphisms of the annulus and the dynamics of                
              flows on three manifolds.                                                      
                   This award will support research in the general area of                   
              dynamical systems. A process which is very simple and easy to                  
              understand locally can become extremely complicated, nonlinear,                
              and difficult to analyze globally. Dynamical systems is the study              
              of this local to global relationship. Many physical systems can                
              best be modeled using this area of mathematics including fluid                 
              flow and turbulence, complex biological systems, mechanical                    
              systems, and chemical reactions.
