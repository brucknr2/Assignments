Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              A series of deep current meter moorings will be deployed in the                
              Brazilian rise (deep western boundary current) in support of the               
              World Ocean Circulation Experiment's Deep Basin Experiment (DBE).              
              The objectives of this study are (1) to observe and quantify the               
              deep circulation, (2) to distinguish between boundary and                      
              interior mixing and (3) to study the nature of boundary mixing.
