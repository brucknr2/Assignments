Abstract    :
                   This award supports the research of Professor A. Garsia to                
              work in combinatorics.  He intends to investigate representations              
              of finite reflection groups, in particular, problems derived from              
              studying the Macdonald basis.  He will also study orbit harmonics              
              and graded representations and the q,t-Kostka coefficients of                  
              bigraded modules.                                                              
                   The research is in the general area of combinatorics.                     
              Combinatorics attempts to find efficient methods to study how                  
              discrete collections of objects can be organized.  And, so it is               
              extremely important to modern communications, for example the                  
              design of large networks as in telephone systems and the design of             
              algorithms in computer science.
