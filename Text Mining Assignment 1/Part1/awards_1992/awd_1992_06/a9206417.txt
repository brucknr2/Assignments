Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  The northern and southern polar regions exhibit striking                  
              differences in ozone depletion and polar stratospheric cloud (PSC)             
              formation.  They are also significantly different in terms of                  
              energetic electron precipitation in the upper atmosphere.  The                 
              suggestion has been made that PSC formation is stimulated by                   
              electron participation by creating bremsstrahlung X rays that                  
              penetrate to the stratosphere and ionize atmospheric constituents              
              there which become nucleation centers for droplet formation.  If               
              correct, this would partially explain why ozone depletion and PSC              
              formation occur almost exclusively in Antarctica:  energetic                   
              electron precipitation is a common phenomenon there, but rarely                
              occurs in the Arctic polar cap.  An experiment to investigate this             
              suggestion is to be conducted.  A balloon payload with a strong,               
              localized ionization source will be flown through the cold Arctic              
              stratosphere; a photographic record would reveal whether the                   
              ionization had caused droplet formation to occur.  A positive                  
              result from the experiment would have wide ranging implications.               
              It would indicate that current models of stratospheric chemistry               
              need to be revised and that additional experimental investigation              
              of the stratosphere is needed.
