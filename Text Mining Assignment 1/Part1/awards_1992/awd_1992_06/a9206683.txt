Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  The goal of this research project is to study the role of                 
              phase transformations in the rheological properties of the deep                
              mantle.  Phase transformations may change the rheological                      
              properties through various mechanisms, including the change in                 
              crystal structure and the change in grain-size.  The present                   
              project includes the following elements.  (i)  High-temperature                
              deformation experiments on single- and poly-crystals of analogue               
              materials.  Analogue materials to be studied include oxides garnets            
              and titanate perovskites.  Both grain-size insensitive                         
              (dislocation) and grain-size sensitive (diffusion) creep will be               
              studied to identify the deformation mechanisms in each regime and              
              to determine the boundaries between the two deformation mechanisms.            
                                                                                             
              (ii)  Transmission electron microscopy of dislocation micro-                   
              structures in high pressure polymorphs of silicates and                        
              experimentally deformed analogue materials to compare the                      
              dislocation slip systems and dislocation core structures, and to               
              infer the relative strength of coexisting minerals.
