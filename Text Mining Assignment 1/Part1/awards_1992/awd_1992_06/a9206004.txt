Abstract    :
                   New techniques and combinations of existing techniques will               
              be used in our studies of the properties of mantle and core                    
              materials.  The research will consist of two general areas of high             
              pressure/temperature research: 1) the measurement of strength of               
              mantle materials at high pressures and temperatures using diamond              
              anvil cells and synchrotron radiation, 2) study of phase                       
              transitions and melting in MgSiO3, MgO and iron at very high                   
              pressures and temperatures by laser heating and synchrotron                    
              radiation.  Our understanding of the dynamics of the mantle and                
              especially the origin of deep earthquakes depends on our knowledge             
              of the mechanisms and kinetics of phase transitions and the                    
              strength of various phases at the pressure/temperature conditions              
              of the Earth's mantle.  Our understanding of the temperature                   
              distribution and composition of the mantle and core depends on our             
              knowledge of the melting temperatures of important mantle and core             
              materials.
