Abstract    :
              The biosynthesis of tetrapyrroles is initiated from simple                     
              molecules and comprises few enzymatic steps.  Moreover, the pathway            
              for the biosynthesis of tetrapyrroles is remarkably similar in all             
              living systems; it is initiated with the biosynthesis of 5-                    
              aminolevulinate (ALA).  In animals, fungi and some bacteria, the               
              first step of the pathway is catalyzed by ALA synthase, the enzyme             
              of focus of this proposal.  While ALA synthase has been recognized             
              as a key enzyme in heme biosynthesis since its discovery in 1958,              
              there has been limited opportunity to study its structure and                  
              function due to the inability to obtain high concentrations of                 
              purified, active enzyme.  The long term goal of this project is to             
              understand how 5-aminolevulinic acid, the first committed                      
              intermediate in the tetrapyrrole biosynthetic pathway, is                      
              synthesized in higher animals, and the mechanism by which this                 
              process is regulated both in liver and erythroid cells. Future                 
              studies projected for the next two years will utilize chemical,                
              biochemical, and molecular biological approaches to overexpress the            
              mammalian 5-aminoevulinate synthase gene in E. coli and purify the             
              overexpressed enzyme in active form; and identify the pyridoxal                
              phosphate binding site and active site of the 5-aminolevulinate                
              synthase.                                                                      
              %%%                                                                            
              As 5-aminolevulinate synthase is the first enzyme involved in the              
              biosynthesis of tetrapyrroles, and the rate-limiting enzyme of the             
              heme biosynthetic pathway in the liver, these studies are of                   
              fundamental importance to the understanding of the metabolism of               
              hemes, chlorophylls, corrins and bile pigments.
