Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Direct Extremum Control (DEC) is a useful tool for analyzing                   
              model algorithms in computational fluid dynamics (CFD).  The                   
              purpose of this research is to investigate the feasibility of                  
              using DEC as a component in designing and analyzing practical                  
              algorithms for large-scale CFD computations.  Particular                       
              attention will be given to the development of a multi-dimensional              
              version of DEC.
