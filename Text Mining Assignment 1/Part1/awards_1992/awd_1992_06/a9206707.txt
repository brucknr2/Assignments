Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Like other proteins that regulate gene expression, homeodomain                 
              proteins appear to be modular in nature. Regulatory target                     
              specificity is determined by the homeodomain and immediately                   
              adjacent regions while other less characterized protein domains                
              are required for regulating gene expression. The specific aim of               
              this proposal is to understand how protein domains outside of the              
              homeodomain contribute to regulatory activity. The Drosophila                  
              homeotic gene Abdominal-B provides an excellent experimental                   
              system for the study of regulatory domains. Abdominal-B encodes                
              two proteins that differ only by a glutamine rich domain, but                  
              have different genetically defined functions during development.               
              Using a heat shock promoter system to ectopically express                      
              proteins during embryogenesis, preliminary results demonstrate                 
              that distinct segmental transformations are generated by each                  
              Abdominal-B protein, as well as a chimeric protein consisting of               
              the Deformed protein but with a substituted Abdominal-B                        
              homeodomain. To analyze the contribution of regulatory domains to              
              the diversity of phenotypes observed, putative regulatory domains              
              will be altered through in vitro mutagenesis. The modified                     
              constructs will be ectopically expressed, and their effect on                  
              cuticular transformations and expression of target genes will be               
              compared to the regulatory activity of the normal Abdominal-B                  
              proteins.
