Abstract    :
                   In the course of developing the world's most efficient                    
              manufacturing sector, U.S. management has relied increasingly on               
              beliefs and practices which are proving to be less well adapted to             
              post-1980 requirements for regaining international competitiveness.            
              The objective of this research is to undertake an intensive                    
              exploration of the management development policies, practices and              
              results in five major Japanese companies as the basis for                      
              comparison with five major U.S. firms in similar industries.                   
                   Field work for the Japanese portion of this exploratory                   
              project has been completed.  This project will carry out the U.S.              
              complementary part of this undertaking.  Given the urgent need for             
              better understanding of the core issues underlying our county's                
              decline in manufacturing competitiveness, this study is not only               
              timely but should contribute a unique and very well respected                  
              perspective to the knowledge base in technology management.
