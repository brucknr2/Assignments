Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              A joint analytical and experimental investigation is to be                     
              conducted of the viscous decay, evolution and interaction of                   
              vortex couples at large Reynolds number.  Analytically,                        
              boundary layer ideas are used to derive their behavior from                    
              known inviscid solutions.  The interaction of vortex couples                   
              with weak background vorticity or shear is studied using                       
              singular perturbation theory.  By studying mixing in the large                 
              Peclet number limit, estimates on the efficiency of vortex                     
              couples in transport are derived.  The experiments employ a                    
              novel use of stratification to create two-dimensional flows.                   
              Mixing is studied quantitatively by the optical tracking of                    
              tracer particles and dye.  Data processing determines the                      
              velocity and vorticity fields as they evolve.                                  
                                                                                             
              Vortex couples, localised dipolar regions of vorticity,                        
              possess nearly closed streamlines, are self-propagating, and                   
              persist for long times.  Consequently, they efficiently                        
              transport vorticity, momentum, heat and contaminants.  Vortex                  
              couples arise in the shear layers and plumes observed in                       
              atmospheric chemistry, ocean mixing, convective cooling, and                   
              turbulent transport and mixing.
