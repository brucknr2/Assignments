Abstract    :
              The relationship between crystalline structure and magnetic                    
              ordering is being studied in single crystal metal oxide                        
              superlattices of Fe3O4 and NiO.  Superlattices of these materials              
              show strong lattice and chemical modulation coherence, sharp                   
              interfaces, an interfacial strain that couples strongly with other             
              properties of the superlattices, magnetic ordering which is                    
              strongly layer thickness dependent, and, finally, a highly                     
              anisotropic electron conductivity.  Extended study of these and                
              similar layered magnetic structures should lead us to an                       
              understanding of the fundamental physical mechanisms that lead to              
              magnetic ordering, as well as the interplay between electronic and             
              structural ordering in magnetic materials.
