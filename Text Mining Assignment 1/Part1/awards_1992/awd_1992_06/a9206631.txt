Abstract    :
                   The principal investigator will conduct research in the area              
              of nonlinear conservation laws and shock waves, continuing the                 
              study of elementary waves and the Riemann problem in resonant                  
              nonlinear systems as well as the convergence properties of                     
              numerical methods utilizing this construction.  Shock waves are                
              the observed in many "flow" situations.  The presence of steep                 
              gradients leads to serious difficulties in both theoretical and                
              numerical methods for obtaining solutions.                                     
                   The qualitative and quatitative analysis of nonlinear waves               
              is of significant scientific interest in view of the wide spread               
              occurrence of such phenomena in real world situations.
