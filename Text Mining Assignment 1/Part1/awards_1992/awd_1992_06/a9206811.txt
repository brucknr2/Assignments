Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This two-year project will focus on 1) the development                         
              and testing of the GIS-based analyses and models to                            
              explore the importance of topography, land use, and                            
              landscape arrangement to nutrient discharges; 2) they                          
              will examine the effects of spatial resolution on such                         
              analyses; and 3) will developing ways to incorporate                           
              fine-scale insights into broad, regional analyses of                           
              nutrient discharge.  The work will focus on coupling                           
              the extensive records of nutrient discharge at the                             
              Smithsonian's Rhode River study site with a very fine-                         
              scale GIS data base.  These researchers will also test                         
              the GIS-based analyses with geographic and nutrient                            
              discharge data from our current studies of the German                          
              Branch watershed on the outer coastal plain on                                 
              Maryland's Eastern Shore and of the Little Gunpowder                           
              Falls watershed on the Piedmont north of the city of                           
              Baltimore.
