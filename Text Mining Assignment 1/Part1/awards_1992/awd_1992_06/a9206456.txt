Abstract    :
                   This award provides one-half the funding needed for the                   
              acquisition of a modern electron microprobe microanalysis system               
              that will be installed and operated in the Department of Geology               
              and Geophysics at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. The                     
              University is committed to providing the remaining funds required              
              for this purchase.                                                             
                   The microanalytical capabilities of the electron microprobe               
              (rapid and automated quantitative chemical analysis of solids with             
              a spatial resolution of a micrometer) are required for the projects            
              of an active group of researchers in geology, geophysics,                      
              engineering, and materials science at Wisconsin.
