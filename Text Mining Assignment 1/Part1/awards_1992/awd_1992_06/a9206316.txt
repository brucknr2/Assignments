Abstract    :
              Gametophytes of the fern ceratipteris richardii are either                     
              hermaphroditic or male.  The primary sex-determining signal in this            
              and many other ferns is antheridiogen, a gibberellin-like pheromone            
              that is secreted by the gametophyte.  In its presence, a juvenile              
              gametophyte develops as a male, whereas in its absence, the                    
              juvenile develops as a hermaphoxlite.  The primary objective of                
              this proposal is to use a combined genetic and molecular approach              
              to understand how antheridiogen governs the sex of the gametophyte             
              of Ceratopteris.  The specific objectives are 1) to identify key               
              regulatory genes involved in sex determination by generating and               
              characterizing mutations; and 2) to isolate genes whose expression             
              is altered in response to antheridiogen using a gene expression                
              screen which identifies mRNAs that differ in abundance between two             
              mRNA populations by a subtractive hybridization method; the                    
              temporal and spatial patterns of their expression will then be                 
              assessed and their function investigated by expressing their                   
              antisense cDNA in transgenic plants.

              This analysis of the sex determining process in Ceratopterts may               
              advance our general understanding of similar processes in higher               
              plants, and will also relate to more general questions concerning              
              hormonal control of genes involved in the reproductive development             
              of all organisms.
