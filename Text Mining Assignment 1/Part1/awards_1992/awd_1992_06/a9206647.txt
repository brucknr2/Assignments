Abstract    :
              The principal investigator will develop thermodynamically                      
              constrained numerical expressions, utilizing computer techniques               
              and experimental data, to develop an open system model which                   
              simulates a wide variety of processes for mafic magmas at pressures            
              up to 20 kbar. Expressions will be calibrated for both major and               
              trace element geochemistry, and will enable simulation of mantle               
              melting processes, high-pressure fractionation, magma mixing and               
              assimilation.
