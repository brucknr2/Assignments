Abstract    :
                   This project is a study of Code-Division Multiple-Access                  
              communication over fading multipath channels.  The overall                     
              objective of the research is to design and analyze practically                 
              implementable adaptive receivers for reliable,                                 
              bandwidth-efficient, and near-far resistant communications.  The               
              feasibility of the project is established via new results in                   
              receiver design and analysis that achieve these objectives for                 
              the nonselective fading, synchronous CDMA channel with memory.                 
              Receiver complexity is of fundamental importance in CDMA                       
              communication and the new idea of group detection is proposed to               
              address that issue.  It is shown that the adaptive receiver                    
              designed for the fading channel with memory far outperforms the                
              conventional spread spectrum receiver.  This research will                     
              consider the development of schemes that will realize the                      
              practically achievable limits of bandwidth-efficient CDMA                      
              communication over general fading multipath channels.  Analytical              
              tools from the theories of detection, estimation, minimax                      
              robustness, optimal filtering, dynamic programming, digital                    
              filtering, large deviations and error probability bounding                     
              techniques for optimum sequence detection problems will be                     
              applied, and new analytical tools sought.
