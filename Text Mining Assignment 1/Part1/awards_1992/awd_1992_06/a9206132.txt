Abstract    :
              The principal investigators will study the vibrational spectra of              
              hydrous silicate glasses and melts at conditions of both elevated              
              pressure/temperature. Results will provide information on the                  
              speciation of H2O in silicate melts under magmatic conditions, and             
              will be of significance in both igneous petrology and materials                
              science.
