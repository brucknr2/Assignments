Abstract    :
              The principal investigator will study the Acasta gneisses in the               
              Slave Province of the NWT of Canada. By field mapping, petrologic,             
              and geochemical/isotopic techniques the PI will utilize these                  
              extremely old rocks to better understand how the Earth's first                 
              lithosphere was stabilized.
