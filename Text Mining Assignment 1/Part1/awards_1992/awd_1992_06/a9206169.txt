Abstract    :
              In this project, the PI will collaborate with PI's from two other              
              institutions to measure Chlorofluorocarbons (CFC's), F-11 and                  
              F-12, from water samples collected on three separate legs                      
              of a hydrographic cruise along 32|S in the Pacific from Chile to               
              Australia as part of the World Ocean Circulation Experiment (WOCE)             
              Hydrographic Program (WHP) (referred to as WOCE line P-6).  This               
              particular project will focus specifically on the western portion              
              between New Zealand and Australia.  Subsequently, similar data                 
              will be collected on a meridional line along 177|W (P-14C), on a               
              cruise immediately following P-6.  Data will be used to examine                
              ventilation and circulation of water masses found in the western               
              basin of the South Pacific Ocean.
