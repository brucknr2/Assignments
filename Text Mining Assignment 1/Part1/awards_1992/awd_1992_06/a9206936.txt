Abstract    :
                   Klimek will continue his study of noncommutative geometry                 
              and the theory of infinite dimensional spaces.  Of particular                  
              interest will be the construction of quantum Riemann surfaces and              
              other noncommutative spaces, and application of the constructive               
              field theory methods to analysis on infinite dimensional                       
              manifolds.                                                                     
                   Modern physics, quantum mechanics and relativity, is a                    
              product of the twentieth century.  It is founded firmly in the                 
              last century's attempt to address the microstructure of matter                 
              and to come to grips with the concepts of action-at-a distance,                
              electro-magnetism, and heat radiation.  The mathematical                       
              foundations for these developments, collectively called                        
              mathematical physics, ranges from detailed analysis of                         
              Schroedinger operators, which governs the dynamics of particles,               
              to unified field theory, which attempts to unite the four known                
              forces into a single theory.
