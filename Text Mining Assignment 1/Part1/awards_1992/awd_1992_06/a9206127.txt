Abstract    :
              The goal of this research is to identify and characterize the genes            
              involved in the unique surface-inducible inhibition of septation               
              associated with swarmer cell differentiation in Proteus mirabilis.             
              Initial experiments will to provide an initial understanding of the            
              molecular mechanisms that allows Proteus to inhibit cellular                   
              septation as a consequence of surface-induced swarmer cell                     
              differentiation. To do so, surface-induced elo genes will be cloned            
              from P. mirabillis using previously constructed Tn5 insertions.                
              Selected elo genes will be characterized by nucleotide sequence                
              analysis and possible homology to the DNA sequence of known E. coli            
              morphogenes determined.  The 5' upstream regulatory region of                  
              select elo genes will be examined to identify putative sites                   
              controlling gene expression.  Lastly, transcriptional fusions                  
              between selected elo genes and promoterless luciferase genes will              
              be constructed so that elo gene expression can be measured in P.               
              mirabilis.                                                                     
              %%%                                                                            
              The significance of this research lies in the uniqueness of the                
              control of elo gene expression.  The environmental regulator                   
              controlling septation (formation of two cells from one) in E. coli             
              is currently unknown.  Using P. mirabilis as a model, it may be                
              possible to provide the missing data needed to understanding the               
              regulation of septation in E. coli.
