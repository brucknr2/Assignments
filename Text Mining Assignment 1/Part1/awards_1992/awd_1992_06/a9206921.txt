Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              With National Science Foundation support, the human osteology                  
              collection at the Peabody Museum, Harvard University, has been                 
              reorganized and stored in individual containers which both                     
              protect the specimens and make them readily available to                       
              researchers. Work has also been done on the supporting                         
              documentation which places these materials into a meaningful                   
              archaeological context. In this final stage of the work, the                   
              Peabody team will continue the computerization of the materials                
              to make the data base readily accessible.                                      
                                                                                             
              This osteology collection is one of the largest and most                       
              important such systematic collections in the United States. It                 
              consists of over 15,000 individuals from well documented                       
              archaeological, medical and forensic investigations. These                     
              collections form a broad comparative resource for cross cultural               
              research in physical anthropology. The materials are widely used               
              by researchers and in scientific demand. Unfortunately lack of                 
              organized documentation makes them difficult to use and places an              
              often unacceptable burden in terms of time on the researcher.                  
              This project will alleviate the situation.                                     
                                                                                             
              This project is important for several reasons. It will improve                 
              access to an important body of scientific data. It will also                   
              facilitate research which helps to explain human biological                    
              adaptation to varying environmental and cultural environments.
