Abstract    :
              This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation Program                 
              to the Department of Chemistry at Northern Illinois University                 
              will help acquire a Differential Titration Calorimeter.  The                   
              acquisition will enhance chemical research involving                           
              thermodynamic studies of protein stability and reactivity and                  
              ligand binding properties of biological membrane systems, i.e.,                
              (a) complex formation between cytochrome c and cytochrome c                    
              peroxidase, (b) structure/function relationships in heme(III)                  
              heme proteins, (c) the influence of Mg2+ on the conformation of                
              bacteriorhodopsin and (d) thermodynamics studies of the                        
              interactions between biological membranes and nonpolar and                     
              amphipathic molecules.                                                         
                                                                                             
              Calorimetry has been extensively used for the study of physical                
              transformations and for the investigation of the kinetics of                   
              both homogeneous and heterogeneous chemical reactions.                         
              Analysis of the heat changes of reactions is useful in studying                
              catalyst surfaces, polymers, micelle formation, and certain                    
              ligand binding reactions of protein.
