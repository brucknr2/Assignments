Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The development of multicellular organisms is a complex process                
              whereby programmed changes in gene expression give rise to specific            
              changes in cellular physiology, morphology and behavior.  Our long             
              term goals are to understand the control of gene expression and its            
              relationship to morphogenesis in the cellular slime mold                       
              Dictyostelium discoidium.  These studies have addressed the genetic            
              regulation and function of the discoidin lectins and have isolated             
              and characterized regulatory gene mutants affecting transcription,             
              demonstrated translational control, examined cAMP and folate                   
              mediated down-regulation, and shown that discoidin is required for             
              normal cell morphology and cytoskeletal organization during                    
              aggregation.  The investigators now wish to a) determine the signal            
              transduction pathways responsible for down-regulation, b) examine              
              the mechanisms of translational control in drsA strains, c)                    
              establish the relationship of discoidin to the cytoskeleton and d)             
              characterize the dynamic behavior of discoidinless mutants during              
              aggregation.  They use a combination of molecular genetic,                     
              biochemical and cell biological techniques to accomplish these                 
              goals.
