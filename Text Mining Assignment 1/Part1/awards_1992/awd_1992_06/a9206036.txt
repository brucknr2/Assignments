Abstract    :
                   This award will provide one-half the funds needed to acquire              
              six computer workstations and increase data storage space for the              
              geophysics computer network in the Department of Earth and                     
              Atmospheric Sciences at Purdue University. The University is                   
              committed to providing the remaining funds required.                           
                   The upgraded computer system will be used in geophysical                  
              research projects ranging from seismic tomography, inversion of                
              wide-angle seismic data, study of the Earth's gravity field,                   
              analysis of laboratory determinations of the elastic properties of             
              rocks, and numerical modeling of mantle convection processes.
