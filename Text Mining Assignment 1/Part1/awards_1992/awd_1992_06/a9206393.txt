Abstract    :
                   Li will study the discrete spectrum of the restriction of                 
              the oscillator representation to reductive dual pairs.  He will                
              relate this investigation to the study of the discrete series of               
              generalized Stiefel manifolds.  The wave front sets and                        
              asymptotic distributions of discrete series will play a vital                  
              role.  The results will be applied to the construction of unitary              
              automorphic forms on classical groups, including those with non-               
              zero cohomology.  They will also be used to construct elements of              
              the Rammanujan Dual.                                                           
                   The theory of Lie groups, named in honor of the Norwegian                 
              mathematician Sophus Lie, has been one of the major themes in                  
              twentieth century mathematics.  As the mathematical vehicle for                
              exploiting the symmetries inherent in a system, the                            
              representation theory of Lie groups has had a profound impact                  
              upon mathematics itself, particularly in analysis and number                   
              theory, and upon theoretical physics, especially quantum                       
              mechanics and elementary particle physics.
