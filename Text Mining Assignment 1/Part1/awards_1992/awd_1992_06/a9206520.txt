Abstract    :
                   This study will examine the stratigraphy of                               
              Cretaceous/Tertiary boundary sediments deposited in the proto-                 
              Caribbean region to determine their provenance, the way in which               
              they were transported, and how local conditions may have influenced            
              their deposition.  In particular, we will determine the size                   
              distribution of impact melt spherules, both as a function of                   
              stratigraphic height and with distance from their source; determine            
              the compositions of impact melt spherule glasses, whether they vary            
              with stratigraphic height or with distance from their source, and              
              infer their provenance based on their compositions; determine the              
              distribution of shocked mineral phases (such as quartz, feldspar,              
              and spinel) with stratigraphic height and infer their provenance;              
              use this information to determine criteria which can be used to                
              assess whether a deposit of boundary sediments is undisturbed or               
              has been reworked; and determine the overall thicknesses of                    
              undisturbed boundary sediments.  These observations of boundary                
              sediments will be coupled with theoretical calculations of ejecta              
              transport.  The combined studies should identify the approximate               
              location of the source crater and the lithologies of the target                
              material, both of which should determine whether the Chicxulub                 
              structure, which we have proposed to be the location of a terminal             
              Cretaceous impact, is a viable candidate.  The study should also               
              have wide application to the deposition of ejecta from large (>100             
              km) craters, a subject which is poorly understood at the present               
              time.
