Abstract    :
                   This project addresses major issues related to the design of              
              metropolitan and nationwide all-optical networks.  These are                   
              networks that attempt to use a substantial portion of the low                  
              attenuation bandwidth of single mode fiber (about 30,000 GHz) on               
              each link of the network.  Such nets switch data between links by              
              all optical means, such as frequency selective couplers, avoiding              
              the use of optoelectronics at the data rate, except at the                     
              periphery of the network.  Major areas of emphasis are (1) link                
              level issues: design and performance of optical demultiplexing                 
              filters, laser phase noise effects on performance including the                
              effect of feedback stabilization, impairments in long distance                 
              multiuser communication including nonlinear effects such as                    
              amplifier saturation and Raman scattering; (2) theoretical and                 
              experimental work at the subsystem level: frequency stabilization              
              at remote locations in a network, fast frequency identification in             
              a distributed environment.  The influence of these issues on                   
              network level issues will be a component of the work.
