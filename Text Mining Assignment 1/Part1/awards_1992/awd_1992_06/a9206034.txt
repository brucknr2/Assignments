Abstract    :
              The Department at the University of Wisconsin-Madison will                     
              purchase a server, workstations, and appropriate software.  This               
              equipment and software will be dedicated to support research in                
              the mathematical sciences.  The equipment will be used for                     
              several research projects, including in particular: research on                
              cohomology of groups by Professor Alejandro Adem, research on                  
              symmetries of complex surfaces by Professor Amir Assadi, research              
              on arrangements of hyperplanes by Professors Peter Orlik and                   
              Hiroaki Terao, research on simulations of the Navier-Stokes                    
              equations by Professor Marshall Slemrod, and research on                       
              nonlinear surface and internal waves by Professor Jean-Marc
