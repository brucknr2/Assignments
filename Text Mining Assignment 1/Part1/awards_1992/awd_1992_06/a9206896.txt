Abstract    :
              The Integrated Photonics Research Topical Meeting                              
              will be held April 13-15, 1992, New Orleans,                                   
              Louisiana.  The Integrated Photonics Research                                  
              meeting, held for the first time in March 1990, is an                          
              annual topical meeting covering the subject areas of                           
              the previous topical meetings on Integrated and                                
              Guided-Wave Optics, Nonlinear Guided-Wave                                      
              Phenomena:  Physics and Applications, and                                      
              Numerical Simulation and Analysis in Guided-Wave                               
              Optics and Optoelectronics.                                                    
                                                                                             
              The Integrated Photonics Research meeting will cover                           
              all aspects of research in integrated and/or guided-                           
              wave photonics.  Topic areas include:  Photonics                               
              Devices and Circuits; Nonlinear Guided-Wave                                    
              Phenomena Modeling, Numerical Simulation, and                                  
              Theory; and Physics, Materials, Technology, and                                
              Characterization.  Each of these areas will be                                 
              represented by a subcommittee of the program                                   
              committee.
