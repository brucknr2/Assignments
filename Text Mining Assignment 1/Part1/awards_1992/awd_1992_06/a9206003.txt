Abstract    :
              This project is developing the parasitic fungus Olpidium as a                  
              vehicle for delivering foreign DNA sequences to plant cells.  The              
              experimental plan has the following research objectives:                       
              1) Characterize the TNV/STNV pseudovirions in terms of composition,            
              physical properties, and size limits of encapsidated DNA, and                  
              refine the preparation of pseudovirions.                                       
              2) Determine Olpidium culture parameters for best zoospore-mediated            
              pseudovirion transfer to various hosts.                                        
              3) Characterize transient expression of DNA introduced into plants             
              via Olipidium and determine the spatial and temporal patterns of               
              such transient gene expression in plant roots.                                 
              4) Evaluate the system for stable transformation of plants.                    
              %%%                                                                            
              The research will provide a ready means for the study of plant                 
              promoters and gene expression in intact roots in a wide range of               
              plant species.  Also, it may open new avenues for transformation of            
              plants hitherto not amenable to current transformation methods.
