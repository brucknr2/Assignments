Abstract    :
                   Professor Thomas will initiate a new program of                           
              investigating coherence properties of atomic ensembles by                      
              measuring the properties of photon echoes.  In particular he will              
              construct a magnetically compensated supersonic atomic beam to                 
              carry out experiments on correlated photon emission in samarium.
