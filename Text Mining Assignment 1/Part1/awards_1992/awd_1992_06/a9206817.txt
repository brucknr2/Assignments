Abstract    :
              With previous NSF support, we have begun a                                     
              careful study of mode conversion between                                       
              optical guided modes in magnetic garnet thin                                   
              films induced by microwave magnetostatic                                       
              waves.  This interaction may lead to new                                       
              microwave and optical signal processing                                        
              devices including microwave spectrum                                           
              analyzers and optical frequency shifters.  We                                  
              propose to continue this work by studying                                      
              two issues related to increasing the conversion                                
              efficiency resulting from the interaction.                                     
              First, the microwave nonlinear phenomena                                       
              which occur when high microwave power is                                       
              used to achieve efficient mode conversion will                                 
              be studied by not only examining the                                           
              microwave spectrum, but by examining the                                       
              optical spectrum of the converted mode and                                     
              the angular distribution of the diffracted beam.                               
                                                                                             
              Second, we propose to study optical mode                                       
              conversion induced by magnetostatic waves                                      
              propagating in a separate layer of a garnet                                    
              heterostructre.  Previous theoretical studies                                  
              have suggested that efficient mode conversion                                  
              may be easier to obtain in a heterostructre,                                   
              with separate layers optimized for microwave                                   
              and optical properties, than in a single                                       
              magnetic layer.
