Abstract    :
              The principal investigator will study phase transitions in rock-               
              forming minerals. Specifically, he will document the effects of                
              impurity content and strain fields on the transformation process               
              in order to establish the behavior of impure and defective crystals            
              at high temperature, utilizing transmission microscopic, single-               
              crystal and powder X-ray diffraction, impedence, and calorimetric              
              techniques. In general he hopes to better understand the mechanisms            
              that drive spontaneous structural distortions that occur in Earth              
              materials at elevated critical termperatures.
