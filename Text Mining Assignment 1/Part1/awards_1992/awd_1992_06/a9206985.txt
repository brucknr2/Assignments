Abstract    :
                   The Department of Mathematics at the Pennsylvania State                   
              University will purchase a computational server to be dedicated                
              to the support of research in the mathematical sciences.  Primary              
              attributes of this server are fast floating point and integer                  
              performance, large main memory and swap space, and high quality                
              color graphics.                                                                
                   Particular research projects which are proposed are four in               
              numerical solution of partial differential and fluid                           
              dynamics-fast solvers for the   water wave equations, numerical                
              study of mixed finite element methods, computation of                          
              free-surface flows, and multigrid and domain decomposition                     
              methods for large scale computations-and one in computational                  
              number theory based on the AXIOM symbolic manipulation                         
              package-symbolic manipulation in number theory and combinatorics.
