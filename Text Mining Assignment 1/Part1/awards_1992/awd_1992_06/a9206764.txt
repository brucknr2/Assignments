Abstract    :
                   This research will examine heterogeneous telecommunication                
              networks, and develop novel solutions techniques for designing                 
              these networks to survive under link or node failure.  The                     
              interconnections of Local Area Networks (LANs), the connection of              
              LANs to Wide Area Networks (WANs), the interconnection of WANs, are            
              all examples of heterogeneous data networks. Each of these                     
              networking problems have unique characteristics based on the                   
              communications protocols and the routing behavior of the                       
              interconnect devices.  The research will consider the design                   
              problem for heterogeneous networks in the framework of formulating             
              a cost minimizing mathematical programming (or optimization)                   
              approach.  Survivable data networks are a special class of                     
              minimum-weight k-connected capacitated spanning networks.                      
              Designing minimum-weight k-connected spanning networks is NP-hard.             
              The problems that this research addresses involve the consideration            
              of additional constraints, and are also NP-hard.  The solution                 
              techniques are based on a hybrid of simulated annealing and graph              
              theory.  In addition to successfully implementing these methods for            
              some heterogeneous network design problems, the PIs propose to work            
              on the design of international heterogeneous telecommunications                
              networks.
