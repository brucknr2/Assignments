Abstract    :
              This research project in the Analytical and Surface Chemistry                  
              Program has been funded as a Small Grant for Exploratory                       
              Research.  The research will develop two novel methods for                     
              attaching DNA and other biomolecules to substrates for their                   
              subsequent examination by scanning probe microscopy.                           
              Successful implementation of these attachment methods will                     
              allow the full power of scanning tunneling and atomic force                    
              microscopy to be applied to the structural characterization of                 
              biomolecules and other macromolecular systems.  Such structural                
              information is essential to understanding the mechanisms of                    
              biomolecule reactions and their relation to life processes.

              The ability to anchor a large biomolecule to a substrate for                   
              microscopic examination will be developed in this research                     
              project.  The interaction of scanning microscopy probes with                   
              the molecule under study has limited the applicability of these                
              powerful methods for large molecules.  This research project                   
              promises to address these limitations, resulting in a better                   
              understanding of the structure of these  biologically important                
              molecules.
