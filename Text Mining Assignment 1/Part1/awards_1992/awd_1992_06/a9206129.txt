Abstract    :
              Plant molecular biology is currently limited by supporting genetic             
              technology, particularly in the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana.              
              This project will develop in vivo genetic methodology, initially               
              for Arabidopsis but in forms suitable for other plant species too,             
              that exploits the analytical power of events targeted in vivo to               
              specific loci.  That will include targeted gene integration, by one            
              or more of several novel approaches (terminal homology vectors;                
              telomere vectors; transformation mutants; positive-negative                    
              selection)  designed to be extendable to plant species hard to                 
              transform; and targeted double-strand breaks (in ectopic                       
              recombination; in transposition), to promote homologous                        
              recombination.  This will allow the full range of modern                       
              recombinant DNA technology to be brought to bear on plant systems,             
              for both fundamental research and breeding of agronomic crop                   
              species.//
