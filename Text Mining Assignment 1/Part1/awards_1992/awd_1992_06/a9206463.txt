Abstract    :
                  This project is focused on the changes in chromatin structure              
              that result from the phosphorylation of specific sites on histone              
              H2A molecules in higher plants. Changes in histone H1 and H2B                  
              phosphorylation are known to alter histone binding to DNA in animal            
              cells, and, as a consequence, the resultant chromatin structure. It            
              is reasonable to suspect that the phosphorylation of multiple SPKK             
              motifs near the C-terminus of wheat chromatin H2A histone may alter            
              chromatin structure by neutralizing large, highly basic regions of             
              the protein. The experimental plan will provide information on the             
              levels of H2A phosphorylation at various stages of the cell cycle              
              and test whether the SPKK motif serves as a substrate for the M-               
              phase protein kinase known as p34cdc2. A series of reconstitution              
              experiments will show how histone H2A, at various levels of                    
              phosphorylation, affects DNA binding and chromatin structure in                
              higher plants.                                                                 
              %%%                                                                            
                 Changes in chromatin structure are widely viewed as being                   
              extremely important during periods of gene expression, and at                  
              specific points during the cell cycle when chromosomes condense and            
              decondense. This project is focused on how the phosphorylation of              
              specific motifs present in the histone H2A molecule change during              
              the cell cycle in higher plants and how this change in histone                 
              charge affects DNA binding and resultant chromatin structure.
