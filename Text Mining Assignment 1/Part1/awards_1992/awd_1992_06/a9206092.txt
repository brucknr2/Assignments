Abstract    :
                This research is to verify and understand the phenomenon of                  
              earthquake fault interface waves involving separation of the fault             
              during rupture.  Based on earlier work by Schallamach and Comninou-            
              Dundurs, and on laboratory fault-rupture experiments with foam                 
              rubber and polycarbonate-solid models, further modeling will be                
              done along with finite difference calculations.  If confirmed, the             
              work bears on questions of low heat flow along faults, weak stress             
              along faults, large overthrusts, and the locking-slip pulse model              
              of rupture.  This research is a component of the National                      
              Earthquake Hazard Reduction Program.
