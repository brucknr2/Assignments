Abstract    :
              This project involves a collaborative effort of two laboratories               
              that are studying the mechanism by which genetic elements                      
              (transposons) move from one location on the chromosome to another              
              in bacteria.  Dr. Goryshin in Dr. S. Lanzov's laboratory in                    
              St. Petersburg is studying the excision process while Dr. Reznikoff            
              is studying the movement process.  The transposon Tn5 is a                     
              composite bacterial transposable element which consists of two                 
              nearly identical IS50 sequences bracketing 3 antibiotic resistance             
              determinants.  Tn5 and IS50 insertions have been found to be                   
              removed by a process called precise excision in which the structure            
              of the interrupted gene is restored to its previous state.  There              
              exists evidence which suggests a relationship between this excision            
              process and the transposition process; in particular IS50 excised.

              Analyzing these relationships may provide us with fundamental                  
              knowledge regarding the role of protein DNA complexes in                       
              stimulating recombination and may help elucidate the mechanisms.
