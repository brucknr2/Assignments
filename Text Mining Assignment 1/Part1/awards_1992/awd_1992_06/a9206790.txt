Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This U.S.-Belarus Joint Workshop, to be held by Dr. Andy R.                    
              Magid of the University of Oklahoma at Norman and Dr. Vladimir                 
              P. Platonov of the Belarus Academy of Science, will be on                      
              "Representation Varieties,"  in particular on the Platonov                     
              Conjecture.  Four researchers from Belarus and four from the                   
              University of Oklahoma will participate in a 14 day workshop at                
              the University of Oklahoma in late summer 1992 to identify joint               
              scientific priorities and developing concrete proposals for future             
              joint projects.  Representation Varieties, or Character Varieties, are         
              geometric objects whose points parameterize the isomorphism                    
              classes of complex matrix representations of a fixed size of a given           
              finitely generated group.  One basic question for these objects is to          
              determine for which groups they are all finite sets.  The Platonov             
              Conjecture speculates that the only linear groups for which this               
              happens are those of arithmetic type.  By bringing together those              
              researchers from Belarus (including Platonov) who have been most               
              deeply involved in this study, and U.S. counterparts who have been             
              deeply involved with related representation variety theory, the                
              workshop should be able to effectively identify the most promising             
              directions for future joint research in the area.                              
                                                                                             
              This project in mathematics fulfills the program objective of                  
              advancing scientific knowledge by enabling leading experts in the              
              United States and Eastern Europe to combine complementary                      
              talents and pool resources in areas of strong mutual interest and              
              competence.
