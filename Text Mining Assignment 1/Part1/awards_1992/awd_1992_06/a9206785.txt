Abstract    :
                   The investigator plans to develop a local stable manifold                 
              theory for non-linear stochastic hereditary systems with a                     
              bounded memory.  A study of the Lyapunov spectrum near stationary              
              hyperbolic orbits will be carried out.  It is expected that the                
              construction of the Lyapunov spectrum will lead to the existence               
              of local stable manifolds around the stationary orbits.  In                    
              specific case studies, the investigator hopes to obtain sharp                  
              estimates on the top Lyapunov exponent, and study its dependence               
              on the noise variance and the delay.                                           
                   The proposer intends to analyze the behavior of dynamical                 
              systems that depend on chance and on the past history of their                 
              states.  The proposed work sill examine the stability of such                  
              dynamical systems in the long term.  The study will be supported               
              by computer analysis of specific models from engineering and the               
              physical sciences.
