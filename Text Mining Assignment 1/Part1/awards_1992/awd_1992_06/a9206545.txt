Abstract    :
                This research is to analyze a wealth of data from a successful               
              seismic expedition to one of the largest, but least understood                 
              features of the earth, the Tibetan Plateau.  This large, high and              
              actively seismic area is a result of the collision of the Indian               
              continent with Eurasia.  Eleven broad-band PASSCAL stations were               
              deployed in the Summer of 1991 for 12 months along a north-south               
              road across the Tibetan Plateau from Llasa to Golmud.  In spite                
              of daunting logistical and physical difficulties, the PIs', in                 
              cooperation with Chinese scientists, are successfully operating                
              the array and have in the first few months, begun the production               
              of an historical data set.  Several new analysis techniques                    
              including receiver function analysis, surface-wave analysis, and               
              refraction analysis will be applied to the data which will be                  
              available to all scientists through the IRIS Data Center.  This                
              research is a component of the National Earthquake Hazard                      
              Reduction Program.
