Abstract    :
                   The principal investigator will continue his study of                     
              problems in complex differential geometry. In particular he will               
              study the interplay between topology and the complex structures                
              on a manifold. These problems will include a study of the vector               
              bundles over a manifold. In addition, Professor Yau will study                 
              some problems in spectral geometry and numerical approaches to                 
              the geometry of the Laplace operator.                                          
                   This award will support research in the general area of                   
              differential geometry and global analysis. Differential geometry               
              is the study of the relationship between the geometry of a space               
              and analytic concepts defined on the space. Global analysis is                 
              the study of the overall geometric and topological properties of               
              a space by piecing together local information. Applications of                 
              these areas of mathematics in other sciences include the                       
              structure of complicated molecules, liquid-gas boundaries, and                 
              the large scale structure of the universe.
