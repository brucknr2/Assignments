Abstract    :
                 This proposal describes a plan to study how the molecular                   
              structure of CD44, a protein expressed on leukocytes and important             
              in signalling and adhesion, is related to its function. The project            
              involves the generation of multiple cDNAs of CD44 isoforms, the                
              transfection of cells with each of these cDNAs, and analyses of                
              consequent cell behavior. Post-translational modifications of CD44,            
              primarily in the form of glycosylation, apparently affect the                  
              binding specificity for the protein. This project also focuses on              
              changes in the glycosylation in the various isoforms of CD44, and              
              the consequent changes in adhesion functions for the molecule.                 
              %%%                                                                            
                 The interaction of endothelial cell glycoproteins and their                 
              complementary leukocyte receptors directs the extravasation of                 
              lymphocytes into inflammatory sites. CD44 is the principal receptor            
              for hyaluronic acid, is constitutively expressed on leukocytes, and            
              mediates both intercellular attachment and extracellular matrix                
              adhesion. CD44 also interacts with intracellular cytoskeletal                  
              elements, and thus, may provide an important link in coordinating              
              extracellular attachments and subsequent changes in intracellular              
              organization. The glycosylation of CD44 appears to play an                     
              important role in the binding specificity for the protein.                     
              Functional comparisons of various isoforms of CD44 with differing              
              glycosylation patterns will provide information on the mechanism by            
              which leukocytes migrate and insight into the events that transduce            
              information from the extracellular environment into coordinated                
              cellular movements.
