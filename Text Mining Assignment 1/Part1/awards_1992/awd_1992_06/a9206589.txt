Abstract    :
              Eukaryotic gene expression is regulated at transcriptional, post-              
              transcriptional, and translational levels.  Although the importance            
              of transcriptional, mechanisms is understood, the role of post-                
              translational controls is only beginning to be elucidated.  Several            
              observations suggest that the iridovirus, frog virus 3 (FV3), may              
              be an excellent model in which to study post-transcriptional/                  
              translational gene regulation:  (a) the steady state level of FV3              
              early messages does not decline in infected cells, whereas host                
              transcripts are rapidly degraded; (b) FV3 messages are translated              
              more efficiently than host or heterologous messages in vitro; (c)              
              early mRNA is not degraded and, after extraction, actively directs             
              protein synthesis in vitro; and (d) late viral messages, which are             
              major gene products in vivo, are translated poorly in extracts from            
              uninfected cells.  Taken together these phenomena suggest that FV3             
              gene expression is controlled, at least in part, at the post-                  
              transcriptional/translational level.                                           
              %%%                                                                            
              In this proposal, the nature of putative post transcriptional/                 
              translational controls will be explored.  To accomplish this, two              
              specific aims have been established.  Sp. Aim                                  
              whether the expression of FV3 genes is regulated at the                        
              translational level by cis-acting mRNA control sequences and/or                
              trans-acting mRNA-binding proteins.  Sp. Aim                                   
              nucleotide sequence of a representative panel of FV3 immediate                 
              early, early, and late mRNAs and ascertain whether viral messages              
              possess unique regulatory signals that control translational                   
              efficiency.  successfully completed these studies will provide                 
              important information on the mechanisms of virus-mediated                      
              translational control and on the cis and trans elements that                   
              regulate viral protein synthesis.  In addition, these studies will             
              extend our understanding of translational control mechanisms in                
              eukaryotic systems.
