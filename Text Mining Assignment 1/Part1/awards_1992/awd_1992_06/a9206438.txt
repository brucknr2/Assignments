Abstract    :
                   This award provides approximately 20% of the funds required               
              to equip a geochronology laboratory at the New Mexico Institute of             
              Mining and Technology (NMIMT) that will be operated jointly by the             
              New Mexico Bureau of Mines and Mineral Resources and the Department            
              of Geosciences at NMIMT. The Bureau of Mines, the Los Alamos                   
              National Laboratory, and NMIMT are committed to providing the                  
              remaining funds required.                                                      
                   The laboratory facility will apply the argon-40/argon-39                  
              radiometric dating technique to determine the history of volcanic              
              activity during the Quaternary Period (with special emphasis on the            
              southwest US region) and to dating the sequence of volcanic tephra             
              (ash) layers within Antarctic ice cores to interpret global                    
              paleoclimatic and paleoenvironmental cycles.
