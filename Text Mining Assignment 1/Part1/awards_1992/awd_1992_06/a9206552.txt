Abstract    :
                   This award will provide one-half the funds needed to acquire              
              a spinner magnetometer to be installed and operated in the                     
              Department of Geology at Occidental College. The College is                    
              committed to providing the remaining funds necessary for this                  
              acquisition.                                                                   
                   The instrument will be used primarily by the Principal                    
              Investigator and his undergraduate students who are actively                   
              engaged in research on the variation of the intensity of the                   
              Earth's magnetic field during magnetic polarity reversals in the               
              past as recorded in rock magnetism.
