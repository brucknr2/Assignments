Abstract    :
              The principal investigator will study nitrogen speciation and                  
              isotope distribution in terrestrial igneous and metamorphic fluids             
              and rocks using experimental, applied, and theoretical techniques.             
              He will attempt to characterize N-isotope signatures related to                
              various magmatic, metamorphic, and meteoric sources, and to                    
              identify N-isotope fractionation mechanisms in mineral-fluid-melt              
              systems.
