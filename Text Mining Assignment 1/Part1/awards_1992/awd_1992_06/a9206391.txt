Abstract    :
                   The organic matrix permeates the structure of calcareous                  
              shells, enveloping the individual crystals and binding them                    
              together.  It is essentially invisible in the scanning electron                
              microscopy (SEM) of cut of fractured shell sections, and has                   
              received little attention as a structural component.  It is                    
              important in the taphonomy of fossil shells, for as long as it                 
              remains intact the original crystallography is preserved.                      
                   One technique does exist for the SEM investigation of the                 
              organic matrix in its normal relationship to shell microstructure.             
              This involves cutting, polishing, and etching a section through the            
              shell, and preserving the exposed organic matrix in place by                   
              critical point drying.                                                         
                   This project will examine the utility of this technique in                
              determining the degree of degradation of organic matrix in fossil              
              mollusks.  Four collections of fossils will be examined,                       
              representing both calcite and aragonite in a variety of                        
              microstructures and over a range of preservational quality.  If                
              measures of matrix degradation can provide a consistent means of               
              determining early stages of alteration in fossil shells, it will               
              open up new avenues of study in the field of taphonomy, and provide            
              a source of supporting data for studies on fossil geochemistry.
