Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              During late oogenesis in Drosophila, ovarian follicle cells                    
              synthesize and secrete several proteins that assemble to form the              
              vitelline membrane and chorion sublayers that comprise the                     
              eggshell. Dr. Waring's research is directed towards understanding              
              the molecular mechanisms that underlie eggshell formation. She                 
              proposes to continue her studies on the dec-1 gene, an eggshell                
              gene that is exceptional in terms of its size, mutability,                     
              production of alternatively spliced transcripts, and post-                     
              translational protein modifications. In addition, she will expand              
              her studies to include other eggshell genes so that she can begin              
              to establish functional interrelationships among the eggshell                  
              proteins. Studies are proposed in three areas. First, antibodies               
              that have been raised against different regions of the dec-1 gene              
              will be used to study proteolytic processing of the three dec-1                
              primary translation products and their derivatives. Second,                    
              product specific antibodies will be used to localize different                 
              eggshell proteins in assembling and mature eggshells. By                       
              comparing the distribution of different eggshell proteins in wild              
              type and mutant eggshells, she hopes to gain insight into                      
              protein-protein interactions that are important in eggshell                    
              assembly. Third, by structural and functional comparisons of the               
              dec-1 gene in evolutionarily distant species, she hopes to                     
              identify molecular features of the dec-1 gene that are essential               
              for its function. Macromolecular assembly has been extensively                 
              studied in viruses and bacteriophage due to the ready                          
              availability of mutations that disrupt their assembly. The                     
              eggshell in Drosophila provides an opportunity to study a                      
              macromolecular assembly process in a genetically amenable                      
              eukaryotic organism.
