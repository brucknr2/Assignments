Abstract    :
              This award provides partial travel support to 10 U.S. academic                 
              researchers to the International Freight Pipeline Symposium                    
              scheduled for July 6-8 in Wollongong, Australia.  Support is                   
              limited to those authors presenting a paper at the meeting.                    
              This Symposium is organized each three years, last time being                  
              held in U.S. in 1989.  Topics to be covered include capsule                    
              transport by pipelines, liquid-solid and gas-solid mixture                     
              flow, materials, turbomachinery, instrumentation, and various                  
              freight pipeline technologies.                                                 
                                                                                             
              Bulk and capsule transportation systems are presently used for                 
              various solids such as coal, limestone, copper concentrates,                   
              etc. and the technologies are rapidly improving.  The previous                 
              symposia were proven to be valuable forums for advancing new                   
              concepts and technologies in a interdisciplinary environment.//
