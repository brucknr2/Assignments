Abstract    :
                   This research is a detailed test of cosmogenic radionuclide               
              exposure dating based principally on measurements of 1OBe, 26Al,               
              and 14C in quartz from boulders which lie on moraine crest of known            
              or accepted ages at the Pinedale Glaciation type locality, Fremont             
              Lake, Wyoming.  The purpose is to determine the limits, accuracy,              
              precision, and resolution of the cosmogenic dating technique.  We              
              will adher to a stringent sampling strategy which minimizes errors             
              due to high erosion rate (i.e. fire-induced surface spallation),               
              pre-exposure, cosmic radiation shielding, unsuitable boulder                   
              surface geometries, and disturbed exposure, cosmic radiation                   
              shielding, unsuitable boulder surface geometries, and disturbed                
              exposure histories due to redeposition or burial of the boulder.               
                   In the first year we will determine the reliability and                   
              precision of the technique to date a moraine by sampling multiple              
              boulders on single moraine ridges, and multiple samples from                   
              selected boulders.  Based on direct dating, regional correlations              
              to dated stratigraphic equivalents, and correlation to the high                
              resolution oxygen isotope chronostratigraphy the Pinedale (Stage               
              2) and Bull Lake (Stage 6) deposits can be aged bracketed at 14-30             
              ka and 130-160ka.  We will date 30 samples from each of the                    
              Pinedale and Bull Lake terminal moraines at Fremont Lake.                      
                   In the second year, armed with a measure of the method's                  
              precision, we will date samples from each of 6 nested Pinedale                 
              recessional moraines in order to determine its resolution.  If the             
              ages of the outermost to innermost moraines yield progressively                
              younger ages this will imply that the technique will be able to                
              directly measure rates to alpine or continental glacial retreat.               
              We will also date 10 boulders from a suspect Stage 4 moraine which             
              lies between the Pinedale and Bull Lake deposits in order to                   
              establish whether or not Stage 4 (Early Pinedale) deposits are                 
              preserved at the Pinedale type locality.  Finally, we will make a              
              useful cross check of dates produced from our method with dates                
              using F.  Phillips' 36C1 technique on duplicate samples from 10                
              boulders which yield the best dates from Year 1.
