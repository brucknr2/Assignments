              algorithms which can be shown to be                                            
              capable of "globally stabilizing" a                                            
              system without persistent

              process models satisfying                                                      
              assumptions which recent results                                               
              show are unnecessarily restrictive,                                            
              or perform very inefficiently and                                              
              consequently are of little

              reason for this is that to be                                                  
              applicable to "large" classes of                                               
              process models, the "parameterized

              "certainty equivalence control" is

              their parameter spaces at which the                                            
              design model is unstabilizable -                                               
              and at such points certainty

              "design model stabilization" is

              this problem by exploiting the

              employing switching.  We propose to                                            
              study switching algorithms of two                                              
              different types.  The first, called                                            
              "hysteresis switching" has already                                             
              been used to successfully resolve                                              
              several long standing problems from

              has the potential of yielding                                                  
              adaptive controllers with                                                      
              capabilities well beyond those                                                 
              existing algorithms.  Ever since

              the concept has been vigorously                                                
              exploited.  One of the main                                                    
              benefits of normalization is that                                              
              it enables one to obtain

              which are very much simpler in                                                 
              structure than are algorithms which                                            
              do not use normalization.  It is                                               
              largely for this reason that tuning

              do.  We propose to further develop
