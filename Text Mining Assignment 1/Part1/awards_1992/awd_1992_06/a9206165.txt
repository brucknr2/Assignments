Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                                                                                             
                                                                                            
              An accurate and precise reference method for determination of                  
              dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in seawater is a prerequisite to                
              obtaining the accurate data necessary to understand the role of                
              dissolved organic matter in the oceanic carbon cycle.  This project            
              has three basic objectives:  (1) to develop a reliable DOC                     
              reference method based on the sealed tube combustion (STC)                     
              technique, (2) to use the STC reference method to evaluate the                 
              accuracy of direct-injection high temperature catalytic oxidation              
              (HTCO) and chemical oxidation methods, and (3) to analyze                      
              ultrafiltered seawater by STC, HTCO, and chemical oxidation methods            
              in order to assess the effect of DOC molecular weight on oxidation             
              efficiency.  Seawater samples will be collected at the U.S. JGOFS              
              Bermuda Atlantic Times Series (BATS Station using an established               
              sampling and processing protocol.  The BATS Station provides an                
              accessible open ocean site and the available time-series data will             
              provide a context for interpreting the results.  This study will be            
              coordinated with a DOC instrument comparison being conducted by the            
              U.S. JGOFS.
