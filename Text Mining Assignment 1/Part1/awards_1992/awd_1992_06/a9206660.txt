Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Congeneric marine fishes and invertebrates with different                      
              latitudinal or depth distribution patterns, i.e., different                    
              absolute temperatures and thermal ranges, will be studied to                   
              determine: (1) the importance of fine-scale adaptations to                     
              temperature in kinetic properties and structural stabilities of                
              enzymes; (2) the amino acid sequence changes that underlie these               
              adaptive differences in kinetic and stability characteristics; (3)             
              the roles played by multi-locus and allelic enzyme variants in                 
              adaptation to temperature over evolutionary and seasonal time                  
              course; (4) the effects of evolutionary adaptation and seasonal                
              acclimatization on mitochondrial respiration and membrane fluidity;            
              and (5) the kinetics of acclimatory change in protein isoforms and             
              mitochondrial respiration and fluidity. These studies are designed             
              to fill in important gaps in our understanding of the thermal                  
              biology of animals, specifically the role played by fine-scale                 
              adaptation to temperature in establishing organismal distribution              
              patterns, the precise changes in protein primary structure that                
              establish adaptive differences in enzymes(M4 - lactate dehydrogenase           
              and cytosolic malate dehydrogenase), the minimal amounts of change             
              in temperature required to favor selection for new  protein                    
              variants or mitochondrial properties, and the rate with which                  
              acclimation occurs. Comparisons of eurythermal and stenothermal                
              congeners will reveal underlying biochemical and molecular                     
              differences that help to establish species' thermal tolerance                  
              ranges. Study of fine-scale adaptations to temperature will provide            
              a firmer basis for predicting the effects of global warming on the             
              distributions and functions of economics animals.
