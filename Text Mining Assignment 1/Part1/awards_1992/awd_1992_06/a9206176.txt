Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              It is proposed to investigate the effects of continental                       
              shelf/slope, bottom topography and friction on the dynamical                   
              balance of western boundary currents with a semi-primitive equation            
              model (SPEM). High-resolution idealized calculations will be                   
              conducted and the momentum, vorticity and energy balances in these             
              simulations will be compared with observations from the Gulf                   
              Stream. Comparisons will include the lateral and vertical structure            
              of the model boundary current, the strength of the recirculation,              
              the location of the separation point and the eddy dynamics of the              
              separated current.
