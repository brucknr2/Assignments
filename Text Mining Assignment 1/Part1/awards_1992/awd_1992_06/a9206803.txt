Abstract    :
              The focus of this research is to discover if endophytic and                    
              pathogenic fungi isolated from the inner bark (phloem,                         
              cambium), leaves and roots of Taxus brevifolia and other Taxus                 
              sp. have acquired the ability to produce interesting natural                   
              products, such as taxol, which are thought to be unique to the                 
              tree. The project could provide a source of important natural                  
              products that are in critically short supply.

              With this Small Grant for Exploratory Research (SGER), the                     
              Synthetic Organic Program is supporting the research of Dr.                    
              Gary A., Strobel of the Plant Pathology Department at Montana                  
              State University.  The fundamental hypothesis to be tested in                  
              this project is whether microbes (fungi) living in close                       
              association with higher plants aquire the ability to produce                   
              specific compounds that appear to be unique to the plant genus.
