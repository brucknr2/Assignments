Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  This project incorporates the use of alluvial stratigraphic               
              and morphologic evidence in the geologic record of Upper                       
              Mississippi Valley floodplains to determine at a high resolution               
              scale (e.ge., event, years, and decades to centuries) how climatic             
              changes of the last few thousand years have influenced the                     
              seasonality of floods and the recurrence intervals of extreme flood            
              events.  A major objective involves quantifying and modelling how              
              flood magnitudes and recurrence frequencies differed between times             
              of climatic transition versus time of climatic extremes, and how               
              the relative direction of climatic change (e.g. warm/moist to                  
              warm/dry versus warm.moist to cool/moist etc.) influences flood                
              magnitude and frequency characteristics.  Results of the research              
              will indicate how the shape and dispersion of a flood frequency                
              distribution change with changes in the mean of a flood                        
              distribution.  The stratigraphic record of climate/flood                       
              associations will be compared with selected long historical                    
              climate/flood records from Europe and from the Yellow River system             
              of China.  The project provides important "event scale"                        
              understandings of linkages between climatic and hydrologic systems             
              that might be anticipated for future climatic conditions that have             
              been projected for various scenarios of atmospheric greenhouse gas             
              loadings.  This type of "event scale" information generally is not             
              available from present global atmospheric circulation models.
