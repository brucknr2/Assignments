Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This project explores a new hypothesis for explaining the patterns             
              of mating in pelagically-spawning marine fish.  The hypothesis                 
              states that spawning sites and times are selected to improve                   
              fertilization rates.  In general, spawning periods represent                   
              critical times for production and vulnerable times for harvesting.             
              It is important to know more about their causal basis.  In the                 
              bluehead wrasse, Thalassoma bifasciatu, Dr. Petersen and colleagues            
              found that the timing of mating varies dramatically between local              
              populations, the mean fertilization rates were surprisingly low and            
              appeared to be influenced by turbulence and location on the reef,              
              and the number of sperm released by males correlated significantly             
              with the size and fecundity of the female with whom they are                   
              mating.  This project will conduct three interrelated                          
              investigations:  (1) determine timing of mating by examining the               
              relationships between several measures of water movement and the               
              time of spawning on reefs with different schedules; (2) locate                 
              mating sites that facilitate fertilization, egg transport off the              
              reef, or both; and (3) investigate fertilization dynamics by                   
              examining how the number of eggs fertilized varies with the number             
              of sperm released by the male, which generates specific predictions            
              of how males should allocate sperm among spawns.
