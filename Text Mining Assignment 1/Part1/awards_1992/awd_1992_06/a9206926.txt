Abstract    :
              The objective of this project is to study the analytical aspects               
              of inverse scattering in tow spatial dimensions.  The topics                   
              include: 1) determining the best function classes for inverse                  
              scattering on the plane which yield well-posedness for Cauchy                  
              problems for nonlinear evolution equations; 2) developing                      
              numerical algorithms for nonlinear evolution equations based on                
              inverse scattering; 3) analyzing the emergence and development of              
              solitons from general data; 4) propagation of singularities of                 
              nonlinear hyperbolic equations.                                                
                   The equations involved in this research have applications to              
              problems in fluid mechanics, nonlinear optics, plasma physics,                 
              etc.
