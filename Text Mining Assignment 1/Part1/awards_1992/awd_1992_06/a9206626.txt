Abstract    :
                   The Institute for Computational Science and Informatics                   
              (ICSI) at George Mason University will purchase a network of RISC              
              workstations which will be dedicated to the support of research                
              in the mathematical sciences.  The equipment is necessary to                   
              carry on computational mathematical research in several areas:                 
              theory of wavelets and computational harmonic analysis, including              
              numerically stable inversion procedures for tomographic imaging                
              and multisensor deconvolution problems; existence and stability                
              of solitary waves in partial differential equations; control                   
              theory for certain partial differential and delay-differential                 
              equations; and attractor reconstruction for dynamical systems,                 
              involving methods which combine delay-coordinate embeddings and                
              Fourier-based filtering for noise reduction and prediction in                  
              nonlinear processes.
