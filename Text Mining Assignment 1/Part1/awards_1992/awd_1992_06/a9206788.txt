Abstract    :
              Optical interconnects play an increasingly important                           
              role in computer architecture.  For instance,                                  
              commercial optical local-area-networks and buses                               
              allow for high-bandwidth, low power, and low-                                  
              crosstalk communication among computational                                    
              resources.  In addition, it is now becoming clear                              
              that fixed, free-space optical interconnects will have                         
              cost and performance advantages for wire-limited                               
              graph layouts.  It is not clear, however, what role                            
              reconfigurable free-space optical interconnects will                           
              play in computer architecture.  To address this                                
              knowledge gap, a workshop is planned by the                                    
              University of Colorado consisting of about 35                                  
              participants from leading universities, research labs                          
              and companies working in computer architecture                                 
              and optical interconnects.  The purpose is to                                  
              compare the cost and performance of                                            
              reconfigurable optical interconnects in different                              
              computer architectures against conventional                                    
              electronic and fixed, free-space optical interconnect                          
              technologies.  The result of the workshop will be an                           
              assessment of the current and projected capabilities                           
              of reconfigurable optical interconnects along with                             
              the communication needs of future computer                                     
              architectures.  This will identify the critical areas of                       
              research in reconfigurable optical interconnects.  It                          
              will also place goals that must be met so that                                 
              computer architectures with reconfigurable optical                             
              interconnects will have cost and performance                                   
              advantages over other approaches.
