Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Running and flying require a substantial increase in energy                    
              expenditures and therefore a substantial elevation of respiration.             
              Mammals and birds may have evolved mechanisms to achieve these                 
              large increases in breathing with exercise that minimizes the added            
              cost of the breathing itself. The body of a bird is full of air                
              sacs that are used as bellows to move air in and out of their                  
              lungs. The muscles and bones that are active and moving during                 
              flight may simultaneously assist the movement of air through its               
              respiratory system by expanding and compressing the air sacs. This             
              project will investigate the ways in which the muscular activities             
              of flying and breathing are coordinated. It will provide insights              
              into fundamental questions about the control of breathing in                   
              vertebrates, especially during exercise. Comparative studies of                
              different species of birds and of different classes of vertebrates             
              will also address questions about the evolution of the control of              
              breathing during exercise. Such studies are also of value to those             
              interested in human performance and rehabilitation.
