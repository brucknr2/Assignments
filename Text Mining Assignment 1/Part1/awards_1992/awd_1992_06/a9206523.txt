Abstract    :
                     This study will obtain samples paleomagnetic analysis from              
              interbedded volcanic and carbonate sedimentary rocks in western                
              Guangxi Province, southern China, in order to better define the                
              Apparent Polar Wander Path for the South China block during the                
              Paleozoic.  Previous models for the rifting of the South China                 
              block from Gondwanaland place the rifting event in the Devonian,               
              but preliminary new data suggest it may have begun much earlier.               
              The results of this study will be important for plate                          
              reconstructions for the Paleozoic and will greatly improve our                 
              understanding of the tectonic evolution of this region.
