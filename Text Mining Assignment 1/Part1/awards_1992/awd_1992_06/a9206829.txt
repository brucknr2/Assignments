Abstract    :
              Nikias         This is a collaborative research project with John G.  Proakis
              (Northeastern University).  The research focuses on the  development, testing
              and mathematical analysis of adaptive signal  processing algorithms based on
              nonlinear performance criteria.   Areas of research include:  1.     blind
              deconvolution algorithms based on criteria with memory  nonlinearity;  2.    
              decision feedback equalizers using higher-order statistics;  3.     joint
              estimation and detection algorithms of the ML-type and  MAP-type when the
              signals are Gaussian distributed;  4.     adaptive multichannel signal recovery
              algorithms when the  signals have gone through severe magnitude and phase
              distortion;  and  5.     blind deconvolution algorithms based on neural
              networks and  Volterra filters.         Special emphasis is placed on the
              investigation of the  numerical properties and performance of the algorithms.  
              Performance metrics being considered include probability of error  in the
              restored sequence as a function of SNR, sensitivity to  signal statistics and
              data conditioning, rate of convergence,  choice of sliding windows and finite
              length effects.   Applications of the new algorithms are being considered in 
              digital communications, speech, image processing and geophysics.
