Abstract    :
              The principal investigator will theoretically and experimentally               
              study multi-component chemical diffusion in silicate melts. The                
              primary goal is to derive and validate a model for multi-component             
              diffusion in which the required quantities are self-diffusion                  
              coefficients and thermodynamic properties that can be obtained in              
              separate experiments. Results of the research will have great                  
              importance in igneous petrology and will have wide application to              
              processes occuring within the Earth.
