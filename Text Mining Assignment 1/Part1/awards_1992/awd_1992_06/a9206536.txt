Abstract    :
                   The plasma physics of the magnetopause is the central                     
              problem of magnetospheric research and our proposed impulsive                  
              penetration process is truly innovative in the sense that it                   
              (i) provides solar wind plasma onto closed field lines in the                  
              boundary layer in sufficient quantities to drive magnetospheric                
              and auroral processes, and (ii) changes the state of                           
              interconnection between interplanetary and geomagnetic field                   
              lines.  We intend to proceed along three approaches in our                     
              research effort: (i) Particle simulation. We plan to cooperate                 
              with others on computer simulation, notably Dr. H. Okuda from                  
              Princeton University.  He is doing state-of-the-art computer                   
              simulation of the physics of the magnetopause. (ii) A test                     
              particle approach.  Starting from M. Gorton's model,                           
              perturbations of the magnetopause will allow us to calculate the               
              inductive electric field and the magnetopause currents. (iii)                  
              Analysis of Experimental Data. Finally, we plan to take the                    
              September 6, 1981 event as a primary test case for the theory and              
              modeling.  On that unique occasion, DE-1 went outside the                      
              magnetopause during a period of very high magnetospheric                       
              compression while DE-2 traversed the foot of the field line on                 
              several orbits.  Either a clear disconfirmation of the impulsive               
              penetration process or a clear confirmation of it would be very                
              important for advancing magnetopause physics.
