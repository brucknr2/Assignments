Abstract    :
                   This award provides funding for the acquisition of several                
              items of equipment for the Purdue Rare Isotope Measurement                     
              Laboratory or PRIME Lab. PRIME Lab operates a tandem Van de Graaff             
              accelerator devoted primarily to geoscience applications of                    
              radioactive dating and the use of extremely rare cosmogenic                    
              nuclides as tracers to explain processes of weathering, groundwater            
              circulation, soil formation, sedimentation, crustal subduction, and            
              extraterrestrial impact phenomena. The equipment to be obtained                
              through this award includes a new charging belt and a cryopump for             
              the accelerator.
