Abstract    :
                   The Center for Computational Statistics at George Mason                   
              University will purchase a Silicon Graphics 4D/420/VGX graphics                
              workstation which will be dedicated to the support of research in              
              the mathematical sciences.  The equipment will be used for                     
              several research projects, including, in particular,1)                         
              nonparametric function (structural) estimation using k-                        
              skeletons, 2) graphics for binned 2-D, 3-D and 4-D data, 3)                    
              adaptive probability density estimation in low to moderate                     
              dimensions using random tessellations, and 4) virtual reality                  
              for exploratory data analysis.  Visualization of statistical and               
              geometric structure forms a key element in these research                      
              projects.
