Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              A series of numerical simulations of the circulation of the North              
              Atlantic will be conducted using the Miami isopycnic coordinate                
              model. The high-resolution runs for the North Atlantic will be                 
              compared to the results obtained by other modeling efforts, namely             
              the Community Modeling Experiment (CME) performed with the level               
              model developed at Princeton's Geophysical Fluid Dynamics                      
              Laboratory. This comparison is done in the context of the World                
              Ocean Circulation Experiment (WOCE).
