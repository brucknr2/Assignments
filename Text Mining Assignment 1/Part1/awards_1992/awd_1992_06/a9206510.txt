Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Virtually all animals undergo marked changes in body structure,                
              function and behavior which enable them to adapt to, and survive,              
              the hardships of a seasonally changing natural environment.  The               
              goal of Dr. Karsch's research is to understand the means by which              
              the changing seasons regulate seasonal reproduction, a natural                 
              process of reversible fertility and infertility.  He has selected              
              domestic female sheep as the model system.  In this species, the               
              process of seasonal reproduction is generated spontaneously by a               
              self-sustained endogenous rhythm of neuroendocrine activity.                   
              Changes in day length provide time cues which permit appropriate               
              phasing of this endogenous rhythm with cyclic changes in the                   
              environment.  Dr. Karsch will determine whether a short day                    
              photoperiodic cue is effective when given during anestrus, and                 
              whether a long day photoperiodic cue is ineffective when given                 
              during the breeding season.  The specific photoperiodic messages               
              will be restored by infusion of melatonin into pinelectomized                  
              sheep.  Melatonin is a hormone secreted by the pineal gland only               
              at night, and it enables the animal to tell how long the night is              
              and thus the duration of the day.  The outcome of this research                
              should lead to new insights into a fundamental problem of enormous             
              biological significance and practical importance: the regulation               
              of fertility.  The results will also be more broadly applicable to             
              a wide variety of physiological, metabolic and behavioral rhythms              
              which form an integral part of the adaptive mechanisms in many                 
              animals.  An understanding of these processes should have profound             
              implications to the reproductive biology of endangered species that            
              are seasonal breeding.  Since the studies will be done in domestic             
              sheep, the findings will have a direct bearing on production in the            
              food and fiber industries.
