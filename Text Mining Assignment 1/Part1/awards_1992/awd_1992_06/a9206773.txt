Abstract    :
                   This study will measure surface uplift rates of the Finisterre            
              Mountains of northern Papua New Guinea, one of the fastest                     
              uplifting areas in the world.  No  other study to date has                     
              succeeded in measuring uplift rates because the young sedimentary              
              rocks that retain the record are usually rapidly eroded away.                  
              The Finisterre Mountains may be unique in preserving a very young              
              (Miocene through Pleistocene) limestone cap.  The uplift rate is               
              a crucial quantity to measure in order to separate uplift versus               
              erosion effects on mountain topography, which in turn will clarify             
              the processes of lithospheric dynamics and mountain building.  The             
              results will have implications for a wide variety of tectonic                  
              problems in mountain belts.
