Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Substrate adhesion molecules (SAMs) belong to a family of adhesive             
              glycoproteins which occur in the extracellular matrix (ECM) of a               
              variety of organisms.  Vitronectin (VN) is a SAM that has been                 
              implicated in cell adhesion and migration.  The PI's have                      
              established that a homolog to VN occurs in the primary cell wall               
              of plants, and have evidence for its role in facilitating pollen               
              tube extension in the style.  The proposed research is a multi-                
              faceted approach to understanding the expression, localization, and            
              function of vitronectin-like molecules during plant development.               
              The experiments proposed will specifically test the role of VN-                
              like molecules during pollination.  Immunocytochemical and                     
              fluorescence staining techniques will be used to examine the                   
              relationship between components of the cytoskeleton, VN-like                   
              molecules, and VN receptors (integrins) during pollen tube                     
              elongation and during shoot ontogeny.  Synthetic peptides that are             
              known to mediate adhesion of VN to its integrin will be used to                
              determine their effect on pollen tube elongation in vivo and in                
              vitro.  cDNA clones that encode VN-like proteins will be isolated              
              and characterized.  The levels of VN RNA during plant development              
              will be examined by RNA blot and in situ hybridizations.  The role             
              of VN-like proteins during plant development will be tested by                 
              overexpressing and underexpressing VN RNAs using chimeric gene                 
              constructs in transgenic plants.
