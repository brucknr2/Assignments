Abstract    :
                   Three faculty investigators and their graduate students are               
              involved in this project.  Martin and Steel will work in set                   
              theory.  Steel, and Martin to some extent, will concentrate on                 
              inner model theory and on strong forms of determinacy.  Martin also            
              expects to complete his monograph on proofs of determinacy.                    
              Moschovakis will work in the theory of algorithms and its                      
              applications to the foundations of mathematical computer science.              
                   Set theory lies at the foundation of all mathematics.                     
              Important questions concern the axioms that underly all number                 
              systems, algebra, geometry and analysis.  Are certain axioms                   
              necessary?  Are they irrelevant in certain contexts?  Particularly             
              significant in this regard is the so-called Axiom of Determinacy,              
              which can be framed as a statement that a certain two-person game              
              has a winning strategy for one player or the other.  The game in               
              question involves constructing a set by having the two players                 
              alternate in selecting members for it.
