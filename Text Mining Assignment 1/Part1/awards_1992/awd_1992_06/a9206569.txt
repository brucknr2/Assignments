Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  In 1986, 1989 and in 1991, the PI conducted Global Positioning            
              System (GPS) measurements in segments of Iceland, one of the few               
              places on land where one can study active rifting and rift-                    
              transform interactions.  From historic data extending back many                
              centuries, a sequence of M>7 earthquakes is overdue in south                   
              Iceland and current deformation in the region must represent the               
              final stage of the interseismic cycle.  In 1988 a magnitude 5.8                
              earthquake occurred within the network, and in 1991 the volcano                
              Hekla erupted displacing nearby control points by up to 6 cm.  Over            
              a broad region the data support a 2 cm/year shear signal applied               
              to the South Iceland Seismic Zone, consistent with north Atlantic              
              plate motions; however, the deformation is complex and is poorly               
              resolved by earlier measurements.  New measurements will provide               
              constraints on the development of shear strain and rift widening               
              in SW Iceland.  The partition of the 2 cm/year budget between these            
              two types of deformation may account for the observed irregular-               
              ities in volcanism and earthquake sequences in SW Iceland.
