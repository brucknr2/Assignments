Abstract    :
              The research in this proposal will focus on host plant                         
              biochemical and molecular mechanisms that regulate                             
              phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase and NADH-glutamate synthase, key               
              enzymes involved in assimilation of symbiotically fixed nitrogen               
              in alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.) root nodules.  This proposal is                
              based on two hypotheses.  The first is that expression of the                  
              nodule PEPC and NADH-GOGAT genes is regulated by cis-acting                    
              element(s) that interact with one or more trans-acting factors                 
              and the activity of these factors is a function of one or more of              
              the following: nodule organogenesis, effective bacteroids,                     
              ammonium ion availability and/or oxygen concentration.  The                    
              second is that direct genetic alteration of nodule PEPC and/or                 
              NADH-GOGAT enzyme activities impacts upon nodule nitrogen                      
              fixation and ammonia assimilation.  The specific objectives                    
              include: 1) isolation and sequence analysis of PEPC and NADH-                  
              GOGAT genomic clones and initial characterization of the promoter              
              regions of these gene by deletion analysis and by protein-DNA                  
              binding studies: 2) localization in planta of PEPC and NADH-                   
              GOGAT proteins and mRNAs by immunogold staining and by in situ                 
              hybridization; and 3) alteration in planta of PEPC and NADH-                   
              GOGAT activities through direct modification of enzyme synthesis               
              by the expression of transformed genes.  Knowledge gained from                 
              these studies will enhance our fundamental understanding of plant              
              genes involved in ammonia assimilation and may facilitate crop                 
              improvement through the development of strategies to modify                    
              nitrogen metabolism.
