Abstract    :
                   Paleoecological research in the Hawaiian Islands will provide             
              new information about whether systems of the tropical Pacific Ocean            
              before, during and since the last glacial maximum, perhaps leading             
              to a better understanding of the discrepancy between continental               
              and marine temperature records.  Changes in past vegetation will be            
              determined from fossil pollen, wood and charcoal in peat bogs and              
              in soils buried beneath lava flows.  Statistical methods of                    
              interpretation will be developed, relating modern pollen                       
              assemblages and plant distributions to the extensive data base on              
               modern climates on the Islands.  Four peat bogs have                          
              been located, at elevations varying from 500 m to 1400 m above sea             
              level, with records extending from the present back to the last                
              glacial maximum, and two of the bogs have bottom dates >36,000 and             
              >41,000 years.  Samples are already available from over 100 buried             
              charcoal deposits.  The locations of fossil sites along an                     
              elevational transect and rainfall gradient controlled by the trade             
              winds means they can provide information about past lapse rates,               
              the strength of the trade winds and the elevation of the trade wind            
              inversion.
