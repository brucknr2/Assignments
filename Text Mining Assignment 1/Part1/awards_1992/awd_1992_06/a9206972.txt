Abstract    :
                   The generating and testing of random variables has provided               
              some of the most widely used methods for Monte Carlo simulation.               
              Several new methods have been developed for new kinds of computer              
              architectures, notably the subtract-with-borrow method that is                 
              very fast, requires few memory locations, has extremely long                   
              periods and provable uniformity.  Current efforts are directed                 
              toward methods that will take advantage of massively parallel                  
              systems, new mass storage devices and other supercomputer                      
              features so that software for statistical computing can keep up                
              with and take advantage of the remarkable advances in hardware.                
                   Many computer simulation studies call for random input at                 
              various point because of uncertainties or complexities of the                  
              underlying models.  The construction of "pseudo-random" numbers                
              can be  sufficiently sophisticated to give workable substitutes                
              for true random observations from a natural process. At the same               
              time these generated numbers are readily available and can, when               
              needed be reproduced exactly for testing purposes or to compare                
              two different computing approaches to the solution of extremely                
              large and complicated mathematical problems.
