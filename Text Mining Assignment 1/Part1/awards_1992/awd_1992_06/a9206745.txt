Abstract    :
              Desorption of atoms from surfaces is being investigated with                   
              ultrafast spectroscopic techniques and surface microscopy.  The                
              work should lead to real-time visualization of desorption phenomena            
              down to time scales of 10-13 sec in selected systems.  The atomic              
              force microscope is employed to image surfaces of ionic insulators             
              eroded by desorption of substrate atoms.                                       
              The work seeks to correlate atomically resolved surface defects on             
              compound semiconductors, such as gallium phosphide, with special               
              desorption sites identified in sub-gap laser-induced sputtering.               
              Two-photon ultrafast spectroscopy is used to obtain dynamic data on            
              surface defect states in insulators.  Desorption from insulator                
              material surfaces induced by electronic excitation is an important             
              concern in application areas such as component survivability in                
              earth orbit, intense pulsed ion sources for accelerators, sputter              
              erosion and deposition of films, laser ablation, and laser                     
              cleaning.
