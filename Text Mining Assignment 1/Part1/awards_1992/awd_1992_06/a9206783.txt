Abstract    :
              This research incorporates an experimental and modeling approach to            
              the nucleation of equiaxed crystals in a casting.  In the model the            
              crystals are assumed to nucleate from dendrite fragments, and                  
              therefore the model is considered to be more realistic than the                
              semi-empirical heterogeneous nucleation models employed heretofore.            
              This research plan includes: (1) the use of a transparent aqueous              
              analogue to substantiate the basis of a model; (2) examination of              
              laboratory scale metallic castings to see if the model can be                  
              extrapolated with justification; and (3) study of grain structures             
              in continuously cast steel as an ultimate test of the model.

              This program links a fundamental approach to real foundry practice             
              by developing improved predictive modeling of the columnar to                  
              equiaxed grain transition and the equiaxed grain size and size                 
              distribution.  This subject is critical to accurate modeling of the            
              grain structure of castings.
