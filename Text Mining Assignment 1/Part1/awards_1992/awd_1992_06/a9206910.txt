Abstract    :
                   Many formal techniques for testing software have been                     
              proposed, but relatively little evidence has been gathered to                  
              indicate how effective these techniques are.  The goals of this                
              research project are 1) to compare the fault-detecting ability                 
              of various previously developed testing techniques, including                  
              control flow based, data flow based, and mutation testing                      
              techniques, and 2) to evaluate the effectiveness of partial                    
              symbolic evaluation of path expressions (PSE), a heuristic                     
              technique that addresses certain semantic analysis issues                      
              arising in testing.  Fault-detecting ability of various test                   
              data adequacy criteria will be compared experimentally by                      
              generating large numbers of test sets for each of several                      
              subject programs, and measuring the proportion of adequate test                
              sets (according to the various criteria) that expose faults.                   
              Fault-detecting ability will also be examined analytically by                  
              investigating conditions under which one criterion is guaranteed               
              to be better than another according to certain probabilistic                   
              measures.  Effectiveness of PSE will be investigated by                        
              measuring the proportion of cases in which the heuristic                       
              succeeds.
