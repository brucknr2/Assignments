Abstract    :
              This award supports travel to the Third International Conference               
              on Mathematical Population Dynamics, which will be held at the                 
              University of Pau, France, on June 1 - 5, 1992.  The focus of                  
              this conference is the mathematical modeling of heterogeneouls                 
              biological populations.  The aim of the conference is to provide               
              an interdisciplinary international forum for an exchange of views              
              and experiences between biologists working on real life data and               
              matematicians developing and analyzing model equations.
