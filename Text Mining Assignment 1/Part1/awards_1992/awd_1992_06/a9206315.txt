Abstract    :
                   The research will address the need for effective methods for              
              the study of the asymptotic behavior and fundamental limits that               
              occur in networking. The work will be restricted to stability                  
              problems in a multidimensional environment.  The definition of                 
              stability as used here is broad enough to cover many aspects of                
              networking behavior such as boundness in probability (i.e.                     
              substability), limiting distributions, geometric ergodicity,                   
              strong stability, rate of convergence to table modes, finite                   
              moments and tails of the queue lengths and waiting time                        
              distributions, partial stability, robustness, cut-off phenomena,               
              shape of distributions, bistability, structural properties (e.g.               
              monotonicity of some parameters of interest), asymptotic                       
              performance, no-starvation regime for real time systems,                       
              practical stability, and sudden changes in network behavior. A                 
              stochastic approach is assumed through the project.  The research              
              will use new approaches  to the stability analysis of networking               
              that are based on a non-Markovian philosophy. The research will                
              demonstrate that such an approach can rigorously provide                       
              stability criteria for such open problems as stability of                      
              multiaccess systems, token passing rings, FDDI, ATM networks,                  
              general network of queues, and so forth.
