Abstract    :
                   This award is for partial support of a workshop in the                    
              study of phenomena associated with the fundamental                             
              interactions of particles within nucleons in nuclei.  The                      
              workshop will bring together experimental and theoretical                      
              practitioners from the fields of nuclear and particle physics                  
              interested in quantum chromodynamics, the science of the                       
              strong interactions in nuclear matter.  The meeting will                       
              follow up on the 1991 Gordon Conference on the same subject.                   
              Approximately 50-70 physicists from the fields of particle and                 
              nuclear physics are expected to attend.
