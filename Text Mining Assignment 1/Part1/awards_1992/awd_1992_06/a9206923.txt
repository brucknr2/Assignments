Abstract    :
                   The principal investigators will continue work in problems                
              in dynamical systems and differential geometry. Professor Burns                
              will study geodesic flows on Riemannian manifolds of negative                  
              curvature and the problem of constructing metrics whose geodesic               
              flow is ergodic. Professor Franks will focus on the dynamics of                
              homeomorphisms of surfaces and in particular, area preserving                  
              homeomorphisms. Professor Robinson will focus on the stability                 
              conjecture for flows in higher dimensions. He will also continue               
              his study of the bifurcations in the formation of the "Smale                   
              horseshoe".                                                                    
                   This award will support research in the general area of                   
              dynamical systems. A process which is very simple and easy to                  
              understand locally can become extremely complicated, nonlinear,                
              and difficult to analyze globally. Dynamical systems is the study              
              of this local to global relationship. Many physical systems can                
              best be modeled using this area of mathematics including fluid                 
              flow and turbulence, complex biological systems, mechanical                    
              systems, and chemical reactions.
