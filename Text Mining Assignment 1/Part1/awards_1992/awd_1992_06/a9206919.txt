Abstract    :
                   Formation of precipitation in deep convective storms has long             
              been recognized as such a complex process that numerical                       
              simulations are needed to assist scientists in understanding                   
              critical physical processes.  The situation is even more                       
              complicated when considering the question of artificial                        
              modification of precipitation.                                                 
                   The Principal Investigator will use advanced numerical models             
              to study cloud seeding effects on the cloud and regional scale.                
              Questions to be addressed include: (1) how would the distribution              
              of precipitation over an area be altered by cloud seeding; (2) can             
              seeding of individual clouds within a cloud group lead to a more               
              favorable environment for the development of successive generations            
              of clouds; what are the primary and secondary modes of ice                     
              generation in clouds of different types and how does seeding affect            
              these different situations?  Model results will be continuously                
              compared to actual data collected from previously completed field              
              programs.                                                                      
                   In the second year of the award the Principal Investigator may            
              participate in a field program using the numerical models in a real            
              time predictive mode.  Model results will be used to help guide the            
              activities of the field program on a daily basis.
