Abstract    :
              Certain highly-efficient gene conversion events have been shown to             
              be dependent on a new class of "mobility endonucleases".                       
              Representing a minimum of three types of DNA-cleavage proteins                 
              based on their cleavage patterns and amino acid sequences, these               
              endonucleases are found in association with group I introns,                   
              promoting conversion of intron-minus alleles to intron-plus.                   
              Sequence analysis of the mitochondrial genome of the filamentous               
              fungus Podospora anserina predicts an unprecedented number of such             
              endonucleases (10-30), providing an opportunity to 1) address the              
              frequency of mobility endonucleases within the mitochondria of                 
              Podospora, 2) characterize selected endonucleases in regard to                 
              their substrate requirements and specificity and 3) study the                  
              expression and regulation of these proteins and their function in              
              the mitochondria.  The Podospora system additionally provides                  
              unique opportunities to study the potential involvement of mobility            
              endonucleases in the phenomena of mitochondrially-related                      
              senescence and horizontal gene transfer.                                       
              %%%                                                                            
              The objective of this proposal is to 1) characterize and compare a             
              selected endonucleases candidate gene in Podospora with a highly               
              similar candidate in Neurospora, utilizing a variety of molecular              
              and genetic techniques and assays, 2) expand this system to study              
              other putative endonucleases, and 3) develop methods to evaluate               
              their role in sentence, the Podospora life cycle and horizontal                
              gene transfer.
