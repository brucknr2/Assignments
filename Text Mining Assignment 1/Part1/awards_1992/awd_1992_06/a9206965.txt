Abstract    :
                   Cowen will study the structure of bounded linear operators                
              on the Hardy Hilbert space, the Bergman Hilbert space, and                     
              related spaces of analytic functions on the unit disk,                         
              approaching problems on concretely presented operators in order                
              to gain insight into more general problems.  He will work on                   
              unifying results concerning composition operators on Bergman and               
              Hardy spaces into a theory of composition operators on spaces of               
              analytic functions emphasizing similarities between spaces and                 
              minimizing reliance on special features of particular spaces.                  
                   Operator theory is that part of mathematics that studies the              
              infinite dimensional generalizations of matrices.  In particular,              
              when restricted to finite dimensional subspaces, an operator has               
              the usual linear properties, and thus can be represented by a                  
              matrix.  The central problem in operator theory is to classify                 
              operators satisfying additional conditions given in terms of                   
              associated operators (e.g. the adjoint) or in terms of the                     
              underlying space.  Operator theory underlies much of mathematics,              
              and many of the applications of mathematics to other sciences.
