Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This award continues support for a cooperative program of round-               
              the-clock joint observations of solar magnetic fields by the Big               
              Bear Solar Observatory and the Huairou Solar Observing Station of              
              Beijing Observatory.  The observations will target the long-term               
              evolution of solar magnetic fields.  Particular problems to be                 
              addressed will be the polar rotation rate, the evolution of polar              
              field elements, the evolution of active regions, the field                     
              changes associated with solar flares, and the flow of magnetic                 
              field elements across filament boundaries.                                     
                                                                                             
              This work must be done with China because Huairou has the only                 
              other videomagnetograph that operates regularly.  The joint                    
              observing capability of the two observatories provides a powerful              
              resource.  No other solar observatories maintain regular or semi-              
              continuous observations of magnetic fields.  Magnetic fields are               
              important to understanding the functioning of the sun and its                  
              effect on Earth.
