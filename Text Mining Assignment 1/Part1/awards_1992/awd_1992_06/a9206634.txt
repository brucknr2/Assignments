Abstract    :
                   The present body of knowledge in monotone regression is                   
              confined to some isolated existence theorems about point                       
              estimation and hypothesis testing.  The investigator plans to                  
              implement these general methods for as many aspects of regression              
              analysis as possible.  In particular, formulas for confidence and              
              prediction intervals will be derived by inverting hypothesis                   
              tests, since usual methods are inapplicable because of lack of                 
              pivotals.  The proposed study will also involve construction of                
              user-oriented tables to bring the restricted procedures to a                   
              level comparable to the unrestricted ones.                                     
                   In regression analysis one tries to predict one variable in               
              terms of another.  In many applications, especially in social                  
              sciences and economics, it is reasonable to assume that the                    
              predicted variable tends to increase (or decrease) as the                      
              predictor variable increases.  Statistical inferences under such               
              assumptions are at a very primitive stage at present, and consist              
              primarily of some general mathematical theorems.  The proposed                 
              study aims at developing concrete formulas and tables so that                  
              users can apply them directly to real-life problems.
