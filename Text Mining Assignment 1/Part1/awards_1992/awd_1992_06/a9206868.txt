Abstract    :
              In this project, the PI will collect and analyze upper ocean                   
              velocity data using an ADCP on a hydrographic line along 32.5|S to             
              30|S from South America to Australia.  This line is currently                  
              designated as part of the World Ocean Circulation Experiment                   
              (WOCE) cruise P-6 (Pacific - line                                              
              as the principal heat flux line in the South Pacific, and is the               
              single most important zonal line in the entire South Pacific US                
              WOCE program.  Hydrographic and tracer work have already been                  
              funded, and this effort will add velocity data to the line, which              
              is critical to the interpretation of the entire data set.
