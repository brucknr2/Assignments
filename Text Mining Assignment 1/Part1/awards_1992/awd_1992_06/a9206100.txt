Abstract    :
                     The Alexander Terrane, an accreted crustal fragment in                  
              southeast Alaska, affords a unique opportunity to determine its                
              paleolatitudinal motion history through paleomagnetic and detrital             
              zircon analysis.  Alternative paleopositions for the terrane during            
              the Paleozoic are:  (1) the Sierra-klamath province of California;             
              (2) the paleo-Pacific margin of Gondwana; or (3) an intra-oceanic              
              setting.  This study will resolve the controversy surrounding the              
              origins and movement history of the Alexander Terrane, and will                
              have major implications for the accretionary history of the North              
              American Cordillera.  The results will have bearing on orogenic                
              processes in other tectonic settings.
