Abstract    :
              This grant provides funds to allow scientists from the US to                   
              attend the Symposium on Magnetic and Spin Effects in Chemistry                 
              to be held at the University of Konstanz in Germany, July                      
              26-31, 1992. The Symposium will include presentations on                       
              magnetic field effects in solution, in the gas phase, in the                   
              solid phase, at interfaces, in supramolecular aggregates, in                   
              photosynthetic reactions and in enzymatic reactions. Other                     
              topics in the fields of chemically induced dynamic polarization                
              and chemically induced electron polarization will be included                  
              in the five-day Symposium. The Symposium is designed to bring                  
              chemists fron a variety of different sub-disciplines together                  
              in an environment which will provide direction for future work                 
              in this rapidly developing field of chemistry.                                 
              %%%                                                                            
              The symposium will bring together chemists from a variety of                   
              subdisciplines to discuss the effects of magnetic fields on                    
              thereactivity of chemical species. In addition to demonstrating                
              that magnetic fields have a profound effect of the reactivity                  
              of chemical processes of synthetic molecules, the prospects for                
              influencing the reactivity and products generated in biological                
              systems will be presented. By utilizing magnetic fields to                     
              influence the chemical consequences of a reaction, the chemist                 
              has a new tool to employ in generating useful chemical products                
              in a controlled environment.
