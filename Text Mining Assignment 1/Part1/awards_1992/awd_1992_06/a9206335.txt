Abstract    :
              Professor R. Stephen Berry is supported by a grant from the                    
              Theoretical and Computational Chemistry Program to organize                    
              an International Conference on Small Particles and Clusters.                   
              This is the 6th conference in this series which is held                        
              every two years, and this is the first such conference to be                   
              held outside of Europe.  The conference will be held at                        
              University of Chicago from September 16 through 23, 1992.                      
              The award will be used to provide participant support for                      
              attendees.                                                                     
              %%%                                                                            
              The subject of inorganic clusters is central to the field of                   
              materials design and preparation, and is one of the areas                      
              specifically targeted in the President's Science Advisor's                     
              special initiatives for 1992.  The study of clusters                           
              provides new kinds of insights into the transition from                        
              molecular to bulk matter.
