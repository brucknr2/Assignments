Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  We propose to explore the reasons why the different approaches            
              to estimating the flexural response of the lithosphere in the Basin            
              and Range province yield different estimates and to develop models             
              that reconcile the discrepancies.  By combining several types of               
              data that are sensitive to different aspects of lithospheric                   
              deformation, it should be possible to substantially improve                    
              understanding of lithospheric rheology.  Instead of just finding               
              the best elastic thickness to fit a particular class of data the               
              goal is to understand the tectonic and rheological processes                   
              responsible for the apparent rigidity and to develop techniques                
              that will permit those processes to be more easily recognized.
