Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The newest hydrate structure, Structure H, which has three                     
              cavities                                                                       
              (one of which is large enough to contain petroleum components)                 
                                                                                             
              will be studied, and higher-order hydrates will be explored                    
              with                                                                           
              molecular-dynamics simulations.                                                
                                                                                             
              Phase equilibria for two systems will be measured to lay the                   
              foundation for statistical-thermodynamics modelling:                           
              methane+adamantane and methane+1methyl-pentane.  Exploration                   
              for                                                                            
              new hydrate cavities will be done by computationally growing a                 
                                                                                             
              dissolved apolar molecule surrounded by discrete clusters of                   
              water molecules.                                                               
                                                                                             
              This is an exploratory, high-risk, high-gain project to                        
              attempt to                                                                     
              define a framework for future gas-hydrate research.  The                       
              analogy                                                                        
              between such hydrate structures and carbon structures known as                 
                                                                                             
              Buckminsterfullerenes ("Buckyballs") will be used.
