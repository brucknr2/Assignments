Abstract    :
                   Subduction-related, high pressure metamorphism is commonly                
              overprinted by younger plutons during convergence and accretion of             
              allochthonous terranes to craton margins.  In the Klamath Mountains            
              of California several accreted terranes contain evidence of low                
              P/T metamorphism related to regional shortening and magmatic                   
              heating that occurred during Middle and Late Jurassic evolution of             
              an a really widespread continent-margin magmatic arc at the western            
              edge of North America.  However, in the southern part of the                   
              Klamath Mountains, these terranes preserve the older, subduction-              
              related high P metamorphism primarily due to an absence of later               
              plutons.  This research will investigate this metamorphism to help             
              constrain the origin, evolution and tectonic environment of these              
              terranes prior to their assembly in mid-Jurassic time.  Results                
              will advance understanding of the late Paleozoic to early Mesozoic             
              paleogeography of the North American cordillera.
