Abstract    :
                   This award provides two-thirds of the funding needed to                   
              upgrade and modernize the electron microprobe in the Department of             
              Mineral Sciences at the American Museum of Natural History (AMNH)              
              in New York City. AMNH is committed to providing the remaining                 
              funds required.                                                                
                   The upgrade consists of a computer automation system and the              
              installation of a new synthetic light-element crystal that will                
              allow quantitative analysis of the elements oxygen and nitrogen and            
              improve the detection limits for fluorine. The staff of the                    
              Department of Mineral Sciences at AMNH are involved in research                
              projects and curatorial activities for the museum's valuable                   
              collection which require the quantitative chemical micro-analytical            
              capabilities of a modern electron microprobe system.
