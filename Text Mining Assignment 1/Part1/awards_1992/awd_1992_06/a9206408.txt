Abstract    :
                   Professor Fortson and his research group are engaged in the               
              search for the electric dipole moment of the electron.  According              
              to standard theory, the electron is a structureless point                      
              particle with unit negative charge and therefore must have a zero              
              electric dipole moment.  However very precise, very sensitive                  
              searches for a nonzero measurement are important because a                     
              nonzero dipole moment would imply that parity-time reversal                    
              symmetry is violated in nature.  In his latest results Professor               
              Fortson sees a suggestion of a possible nonzero result just at                 
              the limits of his instrumental detection sensitivity.  This new                
              grant would permit him to improve his sensitivity sufficiently to              
              declare with certainty whether or not the electric dipole moment               
              of the electron has been found.
