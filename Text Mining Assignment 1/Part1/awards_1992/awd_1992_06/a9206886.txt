Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Gap junctions are comprised of membrane channels that allow the                
              diffusion of small molecules between cells. Studies of gap                     
              junctional communication in the early mouse embryo have shown                  
              that cells in the embryo exhibit preferred pathways of exchange                
              that effectively subdivides the embryo into discrete domains or                
              communication compartments. The spatial organization of these                  
              compartments correlate with ongoing differentiation and cell                   
              lineage segregation events. These observations together with the               
              finding that the inhibition of gap junctional communication can                
              lead to developmental perturbations suggest that gap junctions                 
              may play an important role in mouse embryogenesis. To evaluate                 
              this possibility, in this study the embryonic stem cell approach               
              will be used to target the disruption of the endogenous gap                    
              junction gene encoding Cx43, as Cx 43 transcripts are observed to              
              be differentially expressed within the context of these                        
              communication compartment domains. Once such targeted ES cells                 
              are obtained, they will be used to generate chimeras, from which               
              embryos and mice that are heterozygous and homozygous for the                  
              Cx43 null allele will be obtained and analyzed. A detailed                     
              histological analysis will be carried out to examine if                        
              development is perturbed. The gap junctional communication                     
              properties of these embryos will be monitored by ionic and dye                 
              coupling studies. Of particular interest would be the finding of               
              perturbations in heart development, and the development of the                 
              central nervous system, the segmented vertebral column, limb                   
              morphogenesis, etc., as in situ hybridization studies have shown               
              that Cx43 is expressed in a striking spatially restricted pattern              
              in conjunction with development in these regions of the embryo.                
              The results of these studies should provide valuable insights                  
              into the possible role of Cx43 in mouse development.
