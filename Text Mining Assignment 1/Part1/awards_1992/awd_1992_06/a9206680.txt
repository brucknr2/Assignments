Abstract    :
                   This award will support the development of a magnetometer to              
              measure the magnetic viscosity acquisition coefficients of rocks               
              typical of the Earth's crust at elevated temperatures and pressures            
              simulating in situ conditions in the crust. Magnetic surveys over              
              large areas of the crust have been used to infer both the                      
              composition and structure of subsurface crust. Large regions of                
              crust exhibit high-amplitude magnetic anomalies implying crustal               
              magnetization values much higher than those actually observed in               
              laboratory measurements on small samples of crustal rocks. Part of             
              the discrepancy between these laboratory based measurements of                 
              magnetization in individual samples and what is measured above                 
              large crustal areas is thought to arise from the current inability             
              of laboratory instrumentation to measure the magnetization of rocks            
              acquired over time under the high-temperature-pressure conditions              
              ambient inside the Earth's crust. This project is intended to                  
              provide such measurement capability for researchers trying to                  
              understand the details of the geomagnetic field and its interaction            
              with rock magnetic properties.
