Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The gastrointestinal tract is a dynamic, chemosensory endocrine                
              organ that integrates feeding behavior, digestion, absorption, and             
              assimilation. This proposal requests support for a one day                     
              symposium to examine how that integration is mediated by hormones.             
              Entitled "Comparative Gastrointestinal Endocrinology: Integration              
              of Function," the symposium will be part of the American Society               
              for Zoologists annual meeting held in Vancouver, B.C. in December              
              1992. The symposium has three objectives. First, the ten speakers              
              will examine how the separate processes they investigate contribute            
              to the regulation of the whole digestive system. Second, examples              
              of the hormonal control of gut function will come from animal                  
              groups ranging from mammals to insects. Third, the symposium will              
              emphasize hormone actions, rather than gut hormone chemistry. The              
              outcome should lead to: 1) an evaluation of the integrative roles              
              of regulatory  factors for which functions are known; 2) strategies            
              for determining the actions of "orphaned" chemical mediators,                  
              having known structures but unknown functions; 3) knowledge of                 
              interactions between gut peptides and hormones released at sites               
              remote from the gut; and 4) an assessment of optimal biological                
              models in nonmammalian vertebrates and invertebrates, for                      
              simplifying regularity complexity and for constructing the                     
              phylogeny of endocrine regulation.
