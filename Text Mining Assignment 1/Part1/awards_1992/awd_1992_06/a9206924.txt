Abstract    :
                   The principal investigators will continue their research in               
              dynamical systems. Professor Hubbard will focus his research on                
              dynamical systems in the complex plane as will as higher                       
              dimensional complex spaces. Professor Earle will continue                      
              research on Teichmuller spaces and properties of the Teichmuller               
              metric. Professor Fuchs will study problems in approximation                   
              theory and geometric function theory.                                          
                   This award will support research in the general area of                   
              dynamical systems. A process which is very simple and easy to                  
              understand locally can become extremely complicated, nonlinear,                
              and difficult to analyze globally. Dynamical systems is the study              
              of this local to global relationship. Many physical systems can                
              best be modeled using this area of mathematics including fluid                 
              flow and turbulence, complex biological systems, mechanical                    
              systems, and chemical reactions.
