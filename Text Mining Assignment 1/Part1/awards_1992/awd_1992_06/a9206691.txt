Abstract    :
                   This analysis will test the roles of paleoenvironmental                   
              distribution and adaptation in the evolutionary origins of tetrapod            
              lineages and the causes of local patterns of faunal turnover in the            
              Texas Early Cretaceous.  The well preserved vertebrate fauna being             
              produced from a sequence spanning as much as 15 my includes diverse            
              fishes, amphibians, lacertilians, dinosaurs, and mammals, many of              
              which are new.  Faunas are found in the intercalated marine and                
              terrestrial sediments of the Comanche Series, in habitats ranging              
              from open marine shelf to inland semi-arid floodplain.  Abundances             
              of vertebrate taxa through the section will be analyzed                        
              quantitatively to determine the relationships of taxa to specific              
              environments and their patterns of change through the section.                 
              Paleoenvironments will be assessed based on the sedimentary context            
              of vertebrate localities.  Building upon samples already in hand               
              the stratigraphic and paleoenvironmental diversity of the                      
              vertebrate record will be further developed through a program of               
              screen washing and through quarrying where feasible.  Search                   
              efforts will focus on poorly sampled stratigraphic intervals in                
              central Texas and on more inland environments preserved to the west            
              and south.
