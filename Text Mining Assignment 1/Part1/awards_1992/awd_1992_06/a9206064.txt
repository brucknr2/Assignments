Abstract    :
                   Professor Gordon and his group will continue their research               
              into the optical coherent control of chemical reactivity by                    
              studying three types of processes:  bond-selective                             
              photodissociation, fine-structure selective photodissociation,                 
              and competition between photodissociation and autoionization.                  
              The experiments are designed to compare carefully theoretical                  
              predictions of Shapiro and Brumer to the experimental results.
