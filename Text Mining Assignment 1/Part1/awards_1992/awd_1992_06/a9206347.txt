Abstract    :
                   This grant supports the development of a new method to measure            
              the thermal conductivities of poly-crystalline samples at elevated             
              using a dual-laser technique.  This technique will be applied to               
              actual lower crustal and upper mantle rocks in the form of xenolith            
              samples.  Costs for the development of new experimental techniques             
              will be kept to a minimum by performing the proposed research at               
              Macquarie University, Sydney, Australia, where the resources and               
              expertise of an Industrial Laser Research Unit, and a Lithospheric             
              Modeling Unit with numerous well-characterized xenolith samples                
              will be available to the project at no direct cost.  At the                    
              successful completion of the project, the new technology gained                
              will be technology gained will be transferred to the US. where,                
              additional funding, it will become the basis on an ongoing                     
              undergraduate research effort to characterize thermal properties               
              of lithospheric materials.
