Abstract    :
              Physical models of flow in medium- and high-temperature fumarole               
              fields suggest that mass flow will exert a strong control on                   
              fumarole temperature in most circumstances.  The PIs plan to                   
              monitor temperature and mass flow continuously to test this                    
              relationship in three active fields.  These fields are on Volcano              
              Colima, Mexico, Poas, Costa Rica, and Galeras, Colombia, and                   
              encompass a range of hydrothermal regimes.  At Galeras, young                  
              fumaroles are likely a manifestation of forced convection of                   
              magmatic and deeply circulating meteoritic fluids. At Poas, shallow            
              free convection likely dominates flow.  Colima represents a flow               
              regime intermediate between the other two.  The time scales and                
              interdependence of temperature, mass flow, and geochemistry will               
              vary between these systems.  Geochemical data, particularly stable             
              and cosmogenic isotopes, will help distinguish more clearly between            
              shallow free convection and fumaroles fed by forced convection from            
              relatively deep or magmatic sources.  Differentiation of these                 
              transport mechanisms is important to the understanding and                     
              interpretation of observed changes in fumarole activity at active              
              volcanoes.
