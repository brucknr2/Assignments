Abstract    :
              The principal investigator will study the degree to which ductile              
              strain increases bulk diffusion rates in olivine. Experiments will             
              be performed in a Griggs apparatus, and the resulting samples will             
              be examined via electron microscopy and with the electron                      
              microprobe. The results will be important to structural geologists,            
              geochemists, and metamorphic petrologists who deal with kinetics               
              and equilibrium in deformed rocks.
