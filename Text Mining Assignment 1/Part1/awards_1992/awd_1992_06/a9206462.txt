Abstract    :
                 This project is focused on two mutant lines of the yeast,                   
              Saccharomyces cerevisiae, that respond anomalously to hyperosmotic             
              stress. The mutants are known as HOG1 and HOG4, because of their               
              altered cell cycle response in a High Osmolarity Glycerol assay.               
              The altered genes in these mutants resemble genes that encode a                
              group of protein kinases known to be involved in signalling events             
              during cell growth and division. Osmotic shock is followed by the              
              tyrosine phosphorylation of the HOG1 protein and suggests that                 
              osmotic stress responses are mediated by changes in protein                    
              phosphorylation. Protein phosphorylation changes appear to underlie            
              the signal transduction chain that follows exposure to hypertonic              
              solutions. The experimental plan is directed toward the                        
              characterization of intermediate steps in the signal transduction              
              pathway that involve the HOG1 and HOG4 proteins, and in an analysis            
              of changes in cell cycle progression in these mutants after                    
              hypertonic shock.                                                              
              %%%                                                                            
                 This project is directed toward the study of how cells sense and            
              respond to osmotic stress. Hyperosmotic treatment in yeast normally            
              results in cell cycle arrest, but in two recently-discovered                   
              mutants, arrest does not occur. The altered genes in these mutants             
              have provided clues to the signal transduction chain that is                   
              activated during the hyperosmotic stress response. This project                
              will provide important information on the signal transduction                  
              pathway responsible for the osmotic stress response in yeast, and              
              clues to the underlying regulatory cascades that are activated by              
              osmotic stress in other kinds of cells.
