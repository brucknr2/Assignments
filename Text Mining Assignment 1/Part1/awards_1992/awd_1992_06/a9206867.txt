Abstract    :
                   Research in theoretical elementary particle physics will                  
              attempt to further develop new methods for dealing with the                    
              fact than many of the predictions of quantum field theory,                     
              naively calculated, are infinite.  Less naively calculated,                    
              these predictions are finite and some of them have been                        
              spectacularly successful.  The new methods are simpler than                    
              older ones in certain contexts, and are also applicable to                     
              problems where the older ones are not.                                         
                   This research is an important component of our efforts to                 
              extract the predictions of the so-called "standard model" of                   
              the elementary particles, so that we can test that model.
