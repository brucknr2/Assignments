Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The long term goal of this research is to determine the molecular              
              mechanism of muscular contraction. In this proposal we hope to                 
              provide direct evidence for the "rotating myosin head" hypothesis              
              of Huxley (1969), the widely accepted working model for the                    
              contractile mechanism. Our approach is to correlate the structural             
              changes of the myosin head (orientation and mobility) with force               
              production (mechanical cycle) and the utilization of ATP                       
              (biochemical cycle). In order to delineate physical changes taking             
              place during different steps of the contractile cycle, steady-                 
              state equilibria will be perturbed mechanically and biochemically              
              including "trapping" the cycle at certain steps.                               
                                                                                             
              The orientation and mobility of muscle proteins will be measured               
              using electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy (EPR) following             
              the labeling of these proteins with paramagnetic probes. EPR is                
              uniquely suited for this purpose because it is site-specific and               
              it is sensitive  to static orientation and rotational mobility of              
              proteins.                                                                      
                                                                                             
              We have just developed a number of computational methods to extract            
              the myosin head orientation (rather than the spin probe                        
              orientation) from EPR spectra. This new technology will give a                 
              detailed (3 degree resolution) picture of myosin head reorientation            
              during transitions between the different states in the contractile             
              cycle. We will be able to distinguish between pivoting and spinning            
              motions of the myosin head.
