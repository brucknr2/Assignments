Abstract    :
                     The Proterozoic rocks in the western United States appears to           
              consist of a collage of terranes that accreted to a cratonic                   
              nucleus during successive collisions.  The boundaries between these            
              packages are marked by intense deformation and separate rocks of               
              different histories, but due to later overprints, are commonly                 
              difficult to detect and interpret.  This project will focus on                 
              Proterozoic boundaries well exposed in the Grand Canyon that                   
              preserve excellent records of the path of deformation and                      
              metamorphism.  It will investigate plutons and pegmatite networks              
              to define timing relationships and will explore isotopic variations            
              that can lead to understanding of the origins the various crustal              
              blocks.  Results are expected to provide documentation of several              
              proterozoic tectonic boundaries and to develop a set of criteria               
              for boundary recognition in less-well exposed areas.
