Abstract    :
                   This research is focused on using a newly developed balloon               
              borne sensor for evaluating the long term global atmospheric                   
              effects of the recent Mt. Pinatubo volcanic eruption, especially in            
              regard to its influence on global and polar ozone depletion, global            
              optical depth changes, atmospheric temperature variations, and the             
              possible influence on global tropospheric aerosols.  The research              
              will also help characterize the global volcanic cloud so that it               
              can be put in proper perspective for comparison with past volcanic             
              eruptions.   Systematic balloon sounding of aerosol and ozone will             
              be made at a mid-latitude station in both the northern and southern            
              hemisphere where other supporting measurements are also being made.            
                   As an additional opportunity, variations of tropospheric                  
              aerosols and ozone will also be systematically investigated.  It is            
              believed that such variations can be traced to biomass burning                 
              episodes and are highly significant in regard to tropospheric                  
              chemistry on a world scale.
