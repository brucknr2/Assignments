Abstract    :
                   This award will support the participation of more than 30                 
              scientists from the United States at the International Symposium               
              on Multivariate Analysis and its Applications which will be held               
              in Kowloon, Hong Kong, in March, 1992.  The Symposium will                     
              emphasize the application of multivariate models in medicine,                  
              economics, the social sciences, and industry and on computational              
              aspects of high dimensional data.  The Symposium will be preceded              
              by a series of short courses and will be followed by two                       
              workshops, to be held in Guangzhou and Kunming.  The Symposium                 
              will involve participation of mainland Chinese scientists.                     
                   This award will support the participation of more than 30                 
              scientists from the United States at the International Symposium
