Abstract    :
              Helium data now available on small numbers of samples from about               
              40 of the earth's hotspots, show a well- marked bimodal                        
              distribution of isotope ratios greater and less than MORB values.              
              One part of this proposal is for the measurement of 3He/4He ratios             
              on suites of lavas from the Caroline and Marquesas island chains,              
              which are known to have ratios greater that MORB (Carolines) and               
              equal or less than MORB (Marquesas, based on a few samples only).              
              The second, and major proposed effort, is the continuation of                  
              studies of the isotopic systematics of three major continental rift            
              valley terrains:  the Ethiopian Rift (plus the Rungwe basalts at               
              the southern terminus of the East African Rift), the Snake River               
              Plain with studies also of the Columbia River flood basalts, and               
              the Antarctic basalts from Marie Byrd Land and Victoria Land.  The             
              third effort is the continuing study of rare-gas systematics                   
              (He-Ne-Ar) in phenocrysts (olivine, cpx) and glass from OIB lavas              
              as applied to the question of the Ne and Ar isotope ratios of the              
              "undepleted mantle" source as compared to atmospheric ratios.
