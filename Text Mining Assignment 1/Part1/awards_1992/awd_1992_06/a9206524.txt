Abstract    :
                     Many areas of large-scale crustal extension, such as the Basin          
              and Range province of western USA, have exposed inactive detachment            
              fault surfaces with very shallow dips (<10o).  However, fault-plane            
              analysis of present-day earthquakes worldwide shows that faults                
              with such shallow dips are not usually seismically active.  Thus               
              much controversy has arisen over the original angle of dip of these            
              faults at their initiation.  This project will test the hypotheses             
              that (1) the faults initiated at dips of 10o or less and remained              
              in t hat orientation, and (2) they initiated at dips of 30o to 60o             
              and were subsequently tilted.  Paleomagnetic analysis of selected              
              rock units from the footwall of one such detachment fault in South             
              Mountains, Arizona, will provide the test.  The results will have              
              substantial significance for the tectonic evolution of large areas             
              of extended continental crust.
