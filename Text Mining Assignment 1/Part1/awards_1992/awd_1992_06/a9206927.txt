Abstract    :
                   The principal investigator will continue his investigation                
              of problems in integral geometry and related areas of geometric                
              analysis. He will attempt to extend his earlier work on the                    
              maximal flat transform on a symmetric space of compact type to                 
              construct all symmetric coverings of such spaces. He will also                 
              study integrals attached to the distinguished class of maximally               
              curved spheres and look for higher homotopy group information.                 
                   This award will support research in the general area of                   
              integral geometry. The geometry of a set may often be analyzed                 
              and described by a decomposition of the set into slices. The                   
              geometry of the slices is often fairly simple and easy to                      
              describe. The main difficulty in the analysis is usually the                   
              reconstruction of the underlying geometric features of the entire              
              set from the geometry of the slices. One well know application of              
              this area of mathematics is the CAT scan.
