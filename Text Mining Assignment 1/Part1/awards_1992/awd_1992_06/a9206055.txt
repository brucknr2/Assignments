Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                                                                                             
                  The Southern Basin and RAnge contains one of the Cordillera's             
              most important and enigmatic Cenozoic tectonic regimes - the highly            
              extended terrane consisting of a series of metamorphic core                    
              complexes and detachment fault structures along the southwestern               
              margin of the Colorado Plateau.  This terrane, a 25,000 km2 region             
              known as the Whipple domain constitutes the largest tilt-block                 
              domain within the Southern Basin and Range and is characterized by             
              west-tilted fault blocks and east- to northeast-dipping normal                 
              faults.  This is a project to delineate, in three dimensions, the              
              structural elements of t he Whipple domain and its a boundaries.               
              This study will pay particular attention to subsurface tectonic                
              configurations and spatial relationships as provided by seismic                
              reflection profiles and will be "ground-truthed" by field                      
              observations.  The seismic data base consists of 27 generally high-            
              quality proprietary industry seismic reflection profiles (1400 km)             
              line length) which are already resident at USC or for which we have            
              received permission to obtain.  These data will greatly expand upon            
              the results of earlier CALCRUST work in the Whipple Mountains, and             
              the portions of the COCORP and PACE transects which pass through               
              the Whipple domain.  The Whipple domain probably represents the                
              most complete and contiguous overall exposure of the various                   
              structural elements of the Cordilleran highly extended terrane.
