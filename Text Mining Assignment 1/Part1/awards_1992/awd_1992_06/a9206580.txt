Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The long term objective of this project is to define the role of               
              D-raf mediated signal transduction in the establishment and                    
              elaboration of pattern in Drosophila melanogaster. The specific                
              aims of this project are as follows: 1) to test the model that                 
              activation of D-raf as a serine/threonine kinase depends upon                  
              induction of the "terminal" signal transduction pathway, 2) to                 
              characterize the pattern of D-raf protein distribution in                      
              development, and 3) to identify genes encoding other members of                
              D-raf mediated signal transduction pathways. Since D-raf is the                
              Drosophila homologue of the Raf-1 proto-oncogene, the                          
              characterization of its developmental role and the determination               
              of its mechanisms(s) of regulation will provide clues toward                   
              understanding signal transduction in higher organisms.                         
              Experiments have been designed in this proposal to address the                 
              following questions. Does the D-raf protein display a                          
              serine/threonine kinase activity as predicted by its homology                  
              with Raf-1? Is there a relationship between the phosphorylation                
              state of D-raf and its ability to act as a serine/threonine                    
              kinase? Where in the cell, and at what developmental stages is                 
              the D-raf protein present? What other types of gene products act               
              in D-raf mediated signal transduction pathways? These questions                
              will be answered using cell biological, genetic and molecular                  
              means.
