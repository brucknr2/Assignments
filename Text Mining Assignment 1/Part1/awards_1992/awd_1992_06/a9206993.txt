Abstract    :
                   This grant supports the research of Professor G. Andrews as               
              principal investigator and Professor D. Brownawell as co-principal             
              investigator.  Professor Andrews will work on problems in additive             
              number theory.  In particular, he will concentrate on various                  
              conjectures arising from partition theory.  Professor Brownawell               
              will work on problems arising from Diophantine approximation and               
              transcendental number theory in particular problems arising from               
              Drinfeld modules.                                                              
                   This is research in the field of number theory.   Number                  
              theory starts with the whole numbers and questions such as the                 
              divisibility of one whole number by another.  It is among the                  
              oldest fields of mathematics and it was originally pursued for                 
              purely aesthetic reasons.  However, within the last half century,              
              it has become an essential tool in developing new algorithms for               
              computer science and new error correcting codes for electronics.
