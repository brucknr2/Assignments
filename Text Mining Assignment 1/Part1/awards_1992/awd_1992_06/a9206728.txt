Abstract    :
              This award provides for partial support for a conference to explore            
              the feasibility of a national engineering information service.                 
              International competition in the technological arena has progressed            
              to the point where less than optimal exploitation of our                       
              engineering know-how puts the Nation at a severe disadvantage in               
              the marketplace.  This conference renews serious consideration of              
              actions needed to be taken to establish such a service.
