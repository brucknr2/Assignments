Abstract    :
                     The Late Proterozoic-early Paleozoic rocks of the Tallahassee-          
              Suwannee terrane may provide a critical link between the southern              
              terminus of the Appalachians and the Mauritanides of west Africa,              
              yet they are poorly understood because concealed beneath Mesozoic              
              and Tertiary rocks of the Atlantic Coastal Plain.  This study will             
              examine the major and trace element and isotopic composition of a              
              suite of drill cuttings from the basement rocks of northern                    
              Florida, southern Georgia and southern Alabama to determine the                
              geochemical character of the continental crust in these regions.               
              The data obtained will be used to compose the Tallahassee-Suwannee             
              terrane with Avalonian and West African rocks.  The results of this            
              study will place constraints on late Proterozoic-early Paleozoic               
              tectonic history of southeastern North America and will have                   
              broader tectonic implications for global plate reconstructions over            
              this time interval.
