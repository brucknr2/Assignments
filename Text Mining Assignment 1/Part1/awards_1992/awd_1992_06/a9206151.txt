Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This proposal involves synthesis and characterization of several               
              new families of materials.  Aryl gels are glass-like substances                
              containing rigid-rod organic spacers inserted at regular intervals             
              in a silicate-like network.  The materials may be considered a                 
              hybrid of inorganic silicates and organic network polymers.  Their             
              synthesis is achieved by hydrolytic condensation of                            
              bis(trialkoxysilyl) aryl monomers and related derivatives using                
              sol-gel chemistry.  The mild conditions for their preparation                  
              coupled with the structural diversity of the organic component of              
              the building block provides an opportunity for"engineering" the                
              morphology of the resulting material.  The proposed research will              
              examine the relationship between monomer or "building block"                   
              structure and the morphology of the resulting material.  These                 
              materials have potential applications in a diversity of areas                  
              including optical devices, chromatographic supports, and as                    
              molecular sieves.  In a related study, new ionomeric materials                 
              containing hypervalent siliconates as the basic building block will            
              be prepared.  These materials have virtually no known analogues in             
              nature.  They hold promise as materials with unusual mechanical and            
              ion conducting properties.                                                     
                                                                                             
              This project is supported jointly by the Division of Materials                 
              Research, and the Chemistry Division.
