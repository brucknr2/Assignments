Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This project aspires to further our understanding of ventilatory               
              control in mammals, with special regard to changing body                       
              temperature and extreme conditions of gas exchange. Small bats will            
              primarily be used because they are uniquely suited for revealing               
              the processes of ventilatory control under these conditions. The               
              extreme energetic demands of flight provide a system in which to               
              probe the upper limits of mammalian respiratory function. In                   
              addition, the ability of small bats to reduce their body                       
              temperature and metabolism through torpor permits the exploration              
              of ventilatory control when operating in its most reduced extreme.             
              Exploring ventilatory control processes in whole animals is often              
              thwarted by the experimental process itself, because ventilatory               
              control is subject to conscious override. However, a further                   
              advantage of torpor is that it provides a state in which                       
              ventilatory processes may be investigated free from conscious                  
              interference, thus assuring dependable data. Experiments will be               
              performed using a variety of innovative techniques specially                   
              designed for bats. This study will help elucidate physiological                
              control mechanisms regulating 1) unusually low and high metabolic              
              states, 2) different patterns of ventilation, and 3) the adaptation            
              to environmental changes. This investigation of undisturbed                    
              integrated function will also provide important corroboration of               
              investigations that involve non-intact ventilatory components and              
              more invasive techniques.
