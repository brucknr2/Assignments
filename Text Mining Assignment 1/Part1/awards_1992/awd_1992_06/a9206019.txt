Abstract    :
                   This project partially supports the core support for the work             
              of the Board on Mathematical Sciences, Commission on Physical                  
              Sciences, Mathematics, and Applications of the National Research               
              Council.  The Board activities include the annual Department Chairs            
              Colloquium for the mathematical sciences, the National Science and             
              Technology Week Symposium, specific reports, the initiation of                 
              reports, and the continuous oversight of all activities.  Other                
              activities of the Board include providing recommendations on                   
              research directions and reports on education in the mathematical               
              sciences, interaction of the mathematical sciences with other areas            
              of science, the health of the mathematical sciences, and emerging              
              research directions in the mathematical sciences.  This award                  
              contains support from the National Science Foundation and the Air              
              Force Office of Scientific Research.  Other agencies supporting                
              this project include the Army Research Office, the Office of Naval
