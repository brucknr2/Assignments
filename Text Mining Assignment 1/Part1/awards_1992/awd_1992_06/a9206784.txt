Abstract    :
                   This grant supports the research of Professors C. Pomerance,              
              Helmut Maier and Andrew Granville to work on problems in analytic,             
              computational, and additive number theory.  Professor Pomerance                
              will continue to work on integer factoring algorithms, in                      
              particular the number field sieve.  Professor Maier will work on               
              the size of the coefficients of cyclotomic polynomials and                     
              irregularities in the distribution of primes. Professor Granville              
              will also work on the distributions of the primes as well as sieve             
              theory.                                                                        
                   This is research in the field of number theory.   Number                  
              theory starts with the whole numbers and questions such as the                 
              divisibility of one whole number by another.  It is among the                  
              oldest fields of mathematics and it was originally pursued for                 
              purely aesthetic reasons.  However, within the last half century,              
              it has become an essential tool in developing new algorithms for               
              computer science and new error correcting codes for electronics.
