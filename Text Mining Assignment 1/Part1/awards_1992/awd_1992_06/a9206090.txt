Abstract    :
              The principal investigator will study the solubility of certain Na-            
              and Ca-silicate minerals at elevated temperature and pressure. He              
              will also investigate the solubility of wollastonite-quartz in                 
              NaCl-HCl solutions. This will yield thermodyanmic data necessary               
              to model fluid-rock interaction during contact metamorphism and low            
              to medium pressure regional metamorphism.
