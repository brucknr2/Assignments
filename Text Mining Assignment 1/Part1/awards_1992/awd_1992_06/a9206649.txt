Abstract    :
                   The PI plans some focused experiments and theoretical modeling            
              that are aimed at attaining a constitutive law based upon a model              
              of crack healing and subcritical crack growth.  He has developed               
              a preliminary theoretical model, with these processes as the                   
              underlying basis for it and has found that this model fits the                 
              experimental data better than the existing models.  He has also                
              found in experiments on serpentine that there is clear evidence of             
              two processes operating simultaneously during frictional sliding,              
              with their relative importance depending upon sliding velocity.
