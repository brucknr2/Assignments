Abstract    :
                   The principal investigator will work on several problems in               
              the areas of control theory, optimaization, nonsmooth analysis,                
              and their applications.  Effective qualitative and numerical                   
              methods for studying and solving complex problems in nonlinear                 
              optimization and control will be developed.                                    
                   Optimal control problems are useful as mathematical models                
              in many areas of engineering and operations management.  By                    
              better understanding their structure and properties, the gained                
              insight will lead to improved numerical optimaization algorithms.
