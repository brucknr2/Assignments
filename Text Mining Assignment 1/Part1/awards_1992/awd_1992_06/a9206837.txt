Abstract    :
              This instrumentation development project will develop an acoustic              
              data/command link for complex hydrographic profiling and related               
              underwater hardware.  It builds upon extensive work at Woods Hole              
              Oceanographic Institution on acoustic telemetry and an acoustic                
              modem that has resulted from these efforts.  The acoustic data link            
              is intended to replace or augment the standard data communications             
              link that utilizes conducting wires within the oceanographic cable             
              suspending the CTD package.  Given the large number of hydrographic            
              stations planned for Global Ocean studies and the potential for                
              data loss resulting from broken conducting cables, a back-up                   
              acoustic data link providing real-time information to the ship,                
              would be highly beneficial.  The new data link would also have                 
              application on ships of opportunity when standard oceanographic                
              cables are not available.  The proposed system would also be                   
              compatible with control systems and data loggers in use at other               
              institutions.
