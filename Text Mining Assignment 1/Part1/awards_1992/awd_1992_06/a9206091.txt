Abstract    :
                   This award will support acquisition of hardware in convection             
              with experiments to investigate the effect of aqueous and non-                 
              aqueous chemical environments on low crack growth in monomineralic             
              polycrystalline aggregates.  Two series of experiments will be                 
              performed using orthoquartzite and aplite.  Both series will also              
              include a limited set of parallel experiments on single crystal                
              samples of quartz and feldspar. The experimental design involves               
              double cantilever beam loading geometry, which permits controlled              
              crack growth.  These experiments will provide a means to                       
              unambiguously combine the extensive database on environmental                  
              effects on crack propagation in single crystals with the observed              
              effects in polycrystalline samples of the same materials.  The role            
              of the process zone, the effects of chemical environments on                   
              intergranular cracking, and the roles of kinetics and steric                   
              hindrance will be assessed in experiments.
