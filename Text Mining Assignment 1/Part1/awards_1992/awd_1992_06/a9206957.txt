Abstract    :
                   The principal investigators will continue their research in               
              dynamical systems. They will study relations as dynamical                      
              systems, an alternate approach to chain recurrence for vector                  
              fields, numerical methods for computing periodic and homoclinic                
              orbits, and central configurations in the classical N-body                     
              problem.                                                                       
                   This award will support research in the general area of                   
              dynamical systems. A process which is very simple and easy to                  
              understand locally can become extremely complicated, nonlinear,                
              and difficult to analyze globally. Dynamical systems is the study              
              of this local to global relationship. Many physical systems can                
              best be modeled using this area of mathematics including fluid                 
              flow and turbulence, complex biological systems, mechanical                    
              systems, and chemical reactions.
