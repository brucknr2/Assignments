Abstract    :
              The overall goal of this research is to develop continuous                     
              reactor strategies which overcome the inherent limitations                     
              of Ribonucleic Acid (RNA) transcription in batch reactors                      
              so that efficient production of oligoribonucleotides in                        
              useful quantities (gram scale or greater) can be made                          
              possible.  Synthesis of RNA molecules can be carried out                       
              using an RNA polymerase and synthetic or plasmid                               
              Deoxyribonucleic Acid (DNA) templates.  Because of their                       
              expense, this requires that both the polymerase and the                        
              DNA template be retained in the bioreactor, and that the                       
              unreacted nucleoside triphosphate precursors be recycled.                      
              Exploratory studies are to be carried out on the activity                      
              of the transcription reaction when the DNA template and                        
              the RNA polymerase are immobilized (either separately or                       
              together) on microspheres with reactive surface groups.                        
              Feasibility studies will also be undertaken on the use of                      
              ultrafiltration membranes for separating the RNA product                       
              transcripts from the reaction mixture.
