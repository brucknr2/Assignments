Abstract    :
                   The goal of this research is to develop heuristically                     
              motivated procedures that can find intelligible and natural                    
              proofs of logical theorems efficiently.  The challenge in such                 
              automated proof search is to join human and logic based                        
              approaches to theorem proving.  Automated proof search is                      
              expected to lead to the discovery of procedures that                           
              incorporate significant structures of human argumentation and                  
              can thus be exploited for building "intelligent" tutors.  The                  
              Carnegie Mellon Proof Tutor (CPT) depends on such a search                     
              procedure for classical sentential logic -- in a computational                 
              and pedagogically efficient way.                                               
                   The research will build on the experience with CPT and                    
              the extension of its theoretical base, the Intercalation                       
              Calculus together with completeness and normal form theorems,                  
              to intuitionistic sentential logic and to predicate logic.                     
              This theoretical base is crucial:  it not only sets up the                     
              problem space and provides some, albeit minimal guidance for                   
              proof search, but it also guarantees the correctness of proof                  
              procedures.  Research tasks include:  treating classical and                   
              non-classical sentential logics in a uniform way through                       
              intercalation calculi;  generalizing proof search in                           
              sentential logics to predicate logic; and extending the                        
              approach beyond pure logic to set theory.
