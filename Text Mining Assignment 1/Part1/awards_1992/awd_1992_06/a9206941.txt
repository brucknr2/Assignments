Abstract    :
                   Enright will study the representation theory of Lie algebras              
              defined over a commutative ring in a setting where a                           
              distinguished maximal ideal is proscribed for which the residue                
              field is the complex numbers.  Of particular interest is whether               
              information at the level of Lie algebras defined over rings yield              
              important information for the more traditional Lie algebras                    
              defined over the complex numbers by passage from the ring to the               
              residue field.                                                                 
                   The theory of Lie groups, named in honor of the Norwegian                 
              mathematician Sophus Lie, has been one of the major themes in                  
              twentieth century mathematics.  As the mathematical vehicle for                
              exploiting the symmetries inherent in a system, the                            
              representation theory of Lie groups has had a profound impact                  
              upon mathematics itself, particularly in analysis and number                   
              theory, and upon theoretical physics, especially quantum                       
              mechanics and elementary particle physics.
