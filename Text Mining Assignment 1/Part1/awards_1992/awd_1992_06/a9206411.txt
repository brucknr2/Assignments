Abstract    :
                   This grant covers experimental Elementary Particle                        
              Physics research by a group at the University of Kansas in                     
              collaboration with other NSF and DOE supported scientists.                     
              The group conducts research at CESR, the Cornell electron-                     
              positron colliding beam accelerator, studying electron-                        
              positron interactions with the CLEO II detector.  They will                    
              study bottom quarks and tau leptons, the heaviest fundamental                  
              particles yet discovered.  The properties of the third family                  
              of quarks and leptons in the Standard Model of elementary                      
              particles are almost entirely determined by the work of the                    
              CLEO group at Cornell.
