Abstract    :
              The purpose of this project is to complete the collection of a                 
              large body of archival data on wages in the United States from                 
              1820 to 1860.  The data will be used to construct annual time-                 
              series of nominal and real wages for different occupations and                 
              regions.  These new wage series will improve upon earlier wage                 
              estimates, and will provide important new insights into many                   
              fundamental aspects of nineteenth century American economic                    
              development such as the changes over time in living standards;                 
              the spatial integration of labor markets within the United States              
              and in an international context; the relationship between                      
              economic growth and inequality; the role of economic factors in                
              the coming of the Civil War; and macroeconomic performances in an              
              era of little or no government intervention in economic affairs.               
              This research is important because it will generate a useful new               
              data set along with a more complete analysis of the evolution of               
              the US labor market in the early 19th century.
