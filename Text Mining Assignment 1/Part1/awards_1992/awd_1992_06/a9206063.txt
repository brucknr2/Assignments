Abstract    :
                   The PI will carry out a two-year investigation of the area                
              surrounding the mountain, Ih Bogd, and the rupture area of the 1957            
              Gobi Altay earthquake in southern Mongolia.  The proposed research             
              includes (1) mapping the surface rupture in some detail and (2)                
              searching for and dating organic material to constrain recurrence              
              intervals of such earthquakes and Lake Quaternary rates of slip and            
              vertical movements.  Long term goals include understanding how the             
              landscape in such a clearly intracontinental region evolves by both            
              tectonic and surface processes.  Using a total station he will make            
              topographic maps of some 30 to 50 segments of the rupture zone of              
              the Gobi Altay earthquake in order to obtain objective data to                 
              determine the amount of slip, variations in such amounts along the             
              ruptures, and the orientations of the slip vectors on the various              
              segments.
