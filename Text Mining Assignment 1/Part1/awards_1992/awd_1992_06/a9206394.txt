Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This award offers partial support for the 1992 Aspen Winter                    
              Astrophysics Conference.  These conferences have played a central              
              role in the development or topics at the frontier of astrophysics              
              for some years, and should continue to enhance fruitful                        
              collaboration between leaders in the discipline and many                       
              promising younger investigators.
