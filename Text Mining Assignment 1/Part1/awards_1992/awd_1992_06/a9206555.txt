Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Cell-cell interactions play an important role in defining the                  
              fates of individual cells as they begin to differentiate. While                
              much has been learned about the cell surface proteins that are                 
              necessary for these interactions, relatively little is known                   
              about cytoplasmic components of this process. The overall goal of              
              this research is to identify and functionally characterize                     
              Drosophila cytoplasmic proteins that are important for                         
              developmentally crucial signals. Specifically, these experiments               
              will examine the functions of the Drosophila homolog of the                    
              vertebrate cytoskeletal protein 4.1 (D4.1). The goals of this                  
              proposal are therefore to: 1) Examine the cellular and                         
              developmental effects of D4.1 mutations, 2) Characterize the                   
              major D4.1 alternative splice forms and determine the genomic                  
              organization of the gene that encodes them, and 3) Learn the                   
              precise expression patterns of the major D4.1 protein isoforms at              
              the cellular and subcellular levels, and determine the cellular                
              and developmental effects of ectopic D4.1 expression. These                    
              experiments are expected to provide insights into the function of              
              both the Drosophila and the human 4.1 genes. Therefore these                   
              studies should contribute significantly to work on the role of                 
              cellular interactions in regulating cell growth and determining                
              cell fate during development.
