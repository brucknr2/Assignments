Abstract    :
                   This  research explores and evaluates the use of parallel                 
              processing and parallelism in network host protocol processing,                
              through a combination of theoretical analysis and experimental                 
              implementation, measurement, and evaluation of a vertically                    
              integrated set of host protocol functions.  The implementations                
              use  Sequent and Silicon Graphics shared memory multiprocessors,               
              connected via FDDI, and a modified MACH operating system kernel.               
              The work considers the protocol functionality of a complete                    
              protocol stack, with emphasis on network access, transport, and                
              presentation layer functions.
