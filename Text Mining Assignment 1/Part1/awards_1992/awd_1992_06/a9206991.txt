Abstract    :
                   This is an award made under the RUI program.  Professor                   
              Schmeichel will study the structure of graphs in terms of the                  
              length of the cycles the graph contains and to examine the                     
              algorithmic complexity of various coloring and communication                   
              problems on graphs.                                                            
                   Graph Theory goes back perhaps two hundred years, but only                
              in the last half-century has the field become an active, fertile,              
              and flourishing branch of mathematics.  A graph is a network of                
              lines ("edges") joining points ("vertices"), thus the language of              
              graphs becomes a natural way of describing interrelationships                  
              among separated objects.  Graph Theory figures most prominently                
              as an essential tool in Communications Theory and Computer                     
              Science.
