Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The Environmental Solutions Program and the Science and Technology             
              Center working in concert with the Civil/Environmental and                     
              Electrical/Computer Engineering departments at UT Austin will                  
              involve approximately 175 undergraduate minority students (35/yr)              
              in a variety of environmental problems and a broad selection of                
              tasks including synthesis, growth, and analysis of electronic                  
              materials over a five year period.  The Academic Year Program will             
              involve minority students from the College of Engineering at UT-               
              Austin.  The Summer Program will invite students from schools which            
              have a high predominance of minority groups enrolled, such as                  
              Prairie View A&M, Pan American, Texas A&I, UT San Antonio, UT El               
              Paso, and other campuses that have NSBE, SHPE, or SWE Chapters.                
                                                                                             
              Students chosen for this Research Careers for Minority Scholars                
              (RCMS) program will participate i state-of-the-art research under              
              faculty supervision and sponsored by industry or government.  These            
              students will meet weekly with faculty supervisors and bi-weekly as            
              a group to exchange information and ideas about the progress on                
              their various projects during their semesters of participation in              
              the program.  The research work done by these engineering students             
              will allow them to receive three hours of research credit for                  
              participation in their RCMS program.  Successful conclusion of the             
              student's activity will include the writing and presentation of a              
              final technical report of the work that was performed.
