Abstract    :
              This project will provide for the dissemination of the results                 
              of projects supported by USEME programs.  This year notes the                  
              fourth year that the ACM Special Interest Group on Computer                    
              Science Education (SIGCSE) Symposium and the National Science                  
              Foundation have cooperated in holding sessions at which                        
              grantees from the USEME programs have presented their results,                 
              and Program Directors have made outreach presentations.  The                   
              participation of the grantees has grown each year.  There has                  
              also been developed a "birds of a feather" session which                       
              provides an informal setting for the faculty to ask questions                  
              about the NSF programs in undergraduate education.  Typically,                 
              there will be about 600 faculty attending the Annual SIGCSE                    
              Symposium, and about 2000 faculty attending the Annual ACM                     
              Computer Science Conference (ACS).  One of the goals of this                   
              project is to increase the interest in the NSF undergraduate                   
              programs by the ACS attendees.  The presentations at SIGCSE are                
              becoming a fundamental component for the dissemination of the                  
              results of the USEME programs to the Computer Science education                
              community.  This award allows the principal to continue the                    
              effort, and supports the anticipated increase in the amount of                 
              grantee participation in the future.  With the requested                       
              support, continued increase in faculty interest in                             
              undergraduate computer science undergraduate education is                      
              expected.
