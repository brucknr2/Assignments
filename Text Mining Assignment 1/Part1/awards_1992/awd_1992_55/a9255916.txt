Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This Clark Atlanta University program seeks to provide                         
              intellectually challenging experiences in classroom instruction and            
              hands-on research experiences in the biological sciences and                   
              chemistry for 30 students entering grades 8-12.  The six-week                  
              program is for residential and commuting students in a Young                   
              Scholars Program designed to increase their interest and knowledge             
              about career opportunities in the mathematical and natural                     
              sciences.  The participants will also be made aware of the academic            
              preparation required to pursue these careers through classroom                 
              instruction, weekly seminars, and field trips.  Participants in                
              grades 10-12 will spend 75% of their work day in research                      
              laboratories as members of on-going research teams consisting of               
              research professors, graduate and undergraduate students.                      
              Participants in grades 8 and 9 will enroll in a laboratory-based,              
              interdisciplinary science course that emphasizes research                      
              methodology, problem solving and critical thinking.  Academic year             
              follow-up activities represent a critical component of the program.
