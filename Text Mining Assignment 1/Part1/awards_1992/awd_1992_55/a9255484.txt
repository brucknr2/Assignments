Abstract    :
              The Department of Physics at Miami University, in cooperation                  
              with Central States Universities, Inc. and Argonne National                    
              Laboratory, is conducting one-week and two-day workshops for 20                
              physics teachers from two- and four-year institutions.  Aimed                  
              at sharing ideas on how to teach undergraduate laboratories,                   
              the workshops focus on the Contemporary Physics Laboratory and                 
              the Electronic Instrumentation Laboratory at Miami University,                 
              which emphasize revolutions in physics and electronics in the                  
              lifetime of today's undergraduate students.
