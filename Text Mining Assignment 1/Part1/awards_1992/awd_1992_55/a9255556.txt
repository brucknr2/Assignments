Abstract    :
              This project is designed to educate and train undergraduate                    
              faculty on the advances in computer-assisted techniques for                    
              Finite Elements (FE) analysis of electromagnetic fields.                       
              Through the proposed workshop, Finite Elements for the                         
              Instruction of Electromagnetic Fields, undergraduate faculty                   
              will become knowledgeable and skilled in FE analysis, and will                 
              be able to use this advanced analysis method in the instruction                
              of electromagnetic fields. Therefore,the project will allow                    
              participants to develop the strategies and techniques that are                 
              necessary to use FE analysis in the instruction of                             
              undergraduate electromagnetic courses. The FE materials and                    
              software that will be utilized in the workshop will allow                      
              undergraduate students to approach and solve real-world                        
              problems of electromagnetic fields.
