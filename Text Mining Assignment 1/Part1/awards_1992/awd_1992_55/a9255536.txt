Abstract    :
              College of Computer Science at Northeastern University in Boston               
              proposes to host six one-day regional workshops for faculty members            
              from New England on Active-learning Curricula for Introductory                 
              Computer Science. These curricula are based on extensive use of                
              simple graphics, visual feedback, model programs, and                          
              experimentation.  Each workshop will focus on one topic typically              
              covered in the first-year courses.  Hands-on activities,                       
              discussions, and preparation of course materials will be integral              
              parts of each workshop.***//
