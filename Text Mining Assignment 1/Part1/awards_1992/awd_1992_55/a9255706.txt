Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The "Directory of Student Science Training Programs for Precollege             
              Students" lists the institutions which Science Service is able to              
              locate that are conducting a wide variety of student science                   
              training programs for precollege students.                                     
                                                                                             
              Student science training programs are designed to provide students             
              with educational opportunities in science, engineering, and                    
              mathematics beyond those normally available in course or laboratory            
              work in the students' schools.  The primary means of accomplishing             
              this is by bringing students into contact with the instructional               
              staff, research personel, and general resources of colleges,                   
              universities, and research institutions (private, industrial, and              
              governmental).                                                                 
                                                                                             
              In addition to publishing the "Directory," Science Service conducts            
              an annual conference bringing directors of such programs together              
              so they can exchange ideas.  Each year many people aspiring to                 
              direct such programs attend and start their own programs in                    
              subsequent years.
