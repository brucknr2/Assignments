Abstract    :
              A comprehensive course in polymer chemistry is offered for                     
              college faculty who may wish to include this subject in the                    
              undergradaute curriculum.  The three-week workshop consists of                 
              lectures, demonstrations, and laboratory activities.  Polymer                  
              synthesis and modification, molecular level characterization,                  
              and properties of macromolecules are emphasized.  Particular                   
              attention is given to how polymer concepts can be incorporated                 
              into the undergraduate cuuriculum and laboratory activities                    
              that do not require specialized equipment.
