Abstract    :
              Economics faculty will participate in three-day workshops at                   
              the University of Arizona to learn instructional techniques                    
              that utilize laboratory experiments by undergraduate students                  
              who are enrolled in principles of economics and intermediate                   
              theory classes.  These techniques demonstrate to students the                  
              basis and applicability of economic theory and provide valuable                
              feedback to instructors on student perceptions of theory.                      
              Also, the faculty will participate in established experiments                  
              and learn the techniques for designing experiments for                         
              undergraduate instruction.  The objective of the workshops is                  
              to add a new dimension to instruction and to improve the                       
              teaching and understanding of undergraduate economics.  The                    
              workshops will be conducted during the Summer and Fall, 1993.
