Abstract    :
                   The Durham City Schools and the Durham County                             
              Schools have established a partnership with the                                
              University of North Carolina Mathematics and Science                           
              Education Network to improve the achievement of minority                       
              students in mathematics and science.  The Mathematics and                      
              Science Achievement Project uses the successful existing                       
              model of the MSEN pre-college program and extends it to                        
              reach elementary students and increased numbers of middle                      
              and high school students.                                                      
                   The Mathematics and Science Achievement Project uses                      
              in school activities with minority students in the                             
              primary grades, elementary clubs for minority students in                      
              the intermediate grades, in-school enrichment classes and                      
              university programs for minority students in middle                            
              school, and after school clubs and university programs                         
              for minority students in high school.  Teachers will be                        
              given training in extending the mathematics and science                        
              curriculum and in bias-free classroom teaching                                 
              techniques.  Parents will be given advocate training.                          
                   The Mathematics and Science Achievement Project will                      
              be planned and implemented by the Durham Public Schools                        
              with assistance from the Mathematics and Science                               
              Education Network.
