Abstract    :
              This project will provide for the dissemination of the results                 
              of projects supported by the Undergraduate Course and                          
              Curriculum Development and Curriculum Development in                           
              Mathematics programs.  Projects in mathematics, physics,                       
              chemistry, and computer science are all currently being                        
              supported at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, Dickinson                       
              College, University of Wisconsin, and The University of                        
              Connecticut, each making significant impact on introductory                    
              curricula in their respective disciplines.  The purpose of this                
              project is to bring together some principal investigators of                   
              projects funded through these NSF curricular development                       
              programs and to have them present their experiences at a panel                 
              at the ASEE Annual Conference in June 1992.                                    
                                                                                             
              The American Society for Engineering Education covers the whole                
              gamut of engineering disciplines and provides an opportunity                   
              each summer for many educators to exchange ideas at the ASEE                   
              Annual Conference.  The panelists will discuss their projects                  
              in a small presentation and will answer questions from                         
              attendees at the meeting in order to better acquaint the                       
              attendees with the type of development and progress that is                    
              being made in introductory college and university science                      
              curricula.  It will also present the attendees with a better                   
              view of the opportunities for support that are provided by the                 
              NSF programs.
