Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The project "Scholars in Chemistry at Spelman" will provide a                  
              comprehensive research and academic enrichment program for talented            
              minority women student interested in majoring in Chemistry or                  
              Biochemistry.  The first year 5 sophomores, 3 juniors, and 2                   
              seniors will be chosen.  Thereafter, students who have left the                
              program, will be replaced with students at the sophomore level.                
                                                                                             
              Each student's academic career will include enrichment activities              
              such as special weekly lectures, a visiting lecture series, seminar            
              participation, and professional conference attendance.                         
                                                                                             
              Two years of research experience with faculty mentors, who also                
              serve as role models will culminate in a written thesis. A summer              
              of research experience before the junior year, as well as a summer             
              at an outside research facility will give scholars a strong mentor             
              in  her major on entry to the College.  This mentor may or may not             
              become her research mentor.                                                    
                                                                                             
              The College has established an Office of Science, Engineering, and             
              Technical Careers (OSETC) to assist in counseling, graduate school             
              contacts, and the application process.
