Abstract    :
              This project continues a pilot project funded last year.  A series             
              of 6-day short courses in manufacturing are being held for                     
              mathematics and science faculty (with an emphasis on 2-year and                
              minority institutions as well as female and disabled faculty).                 
              During the 2-year project life, 120 faculty will participate.                  
                                                                                             
              The project uses manufacturing as a vehicle to illustrate the                  
              relevant application of basic scientific, mathematical, and                    
              engineering principles.  Previously developed modules on casting,              
              circuit board manufacturing, and machining are being expanded and              
              improved.  A new fourth module on the mathematics of quality                   
              assurance is being developed and taught.  In addition the                      
              participants are taken on narrated tours of selected manufacturing             
              facilities by the course faculty. Discussion sessions facilitate               
              interaction among participants as well as absorption of the day's              
              lessons.  There is heavy emphasis on providing participants with               
              instructional materials to incorporate into their own classes.  A              
              (single issue) newsletter provides long-term interaction.  And, a              
              final assessment will be performed.
