Abstract    :
              Logic Synthesis and top-down design are increasingly being used for            
              digital system design in industry. Introducing logic synthesis                 
              techniques into a computer science or engineering curriculum can be            
              a daunting task for the educator because of the wide number of                 
              choices of languages and toolsets. Two workshops on Logic Synthesis            
              in the Classroom will be held; one workshop will be aimed at                   
              educators on a budget and will consist of all public domain tools              
              which participants can immediately begin using in the classroom. A             
              second workshop will feature a combination of the Viewlogic                    
              commercial tool suite and public domain tools. Both of these                   
              toolsets have been used in the MSU Advanced Digital Design course              
              with great success.
