Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The University of Denver seeks to provide enrichment                           
              experience in engineering for 50 students in a three-week                      
              commuter/residential Young Scholars Program. The                               
              participants will be students entering grades ten, eleven,                     
              and twelve. Programmatic activities will include all                           
              engineering disciplines, however, special emphasis will be                     
              on electrical and mechanical engineering. The project                          
              activities, which include research, career exploration, and                    
              ethical issues, are designed to encourage high school                          
              students to elect a career in engineering.
