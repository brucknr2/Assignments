Abstract    :
              This five-day workshop for college mathematics faculty will be                 
              held at Salisbury State University and is sponsored by the MAA.                
              The goal of the workshop is to provide classroom environmental                 
              applications suitable for several levels of courses, including                 
              general education as well as sophomore/junior level modeling                   
              courses.  The chief lecturer is H.T. Odum, a systems ecologist                 
              from the University of Florida.  The workshop will emphasis                    
              visual, qualitative, and computational aspects in modeling and                 
              analysis.  Participants will develop materials for use in the                  
              classroom and present them at a subsequent follow-up meeting.
