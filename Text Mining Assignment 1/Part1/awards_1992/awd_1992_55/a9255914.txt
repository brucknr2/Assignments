Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The University of California at Berkeley will initiate a                       
              six-week, commuter, Early Alert Initiative in physics and                      
              mathematics for 120 students entering the 7th, 8th, and 9th                    
              grades.                                                                        
                                                                                             
              This summer and academic year program will emphasize the                       
              study of mathematics, physics, and engineering concepts in                     
              ways that will demonstrate to the participants how academic                    
              course work relates to the world around them and how the                       
              practice of science is accomplished.  Students are presented                   
              with unusual themes such as exploring space for                                
              extraterrestrial life forms.  This leads to the study of                       
              radio signals from deep space, galactic noise, coding                          
              systems, and structural materials.  Students learn the                         
              mathematics of the development of the Richter Scale and how                    
              earthquake intensity is measured.
