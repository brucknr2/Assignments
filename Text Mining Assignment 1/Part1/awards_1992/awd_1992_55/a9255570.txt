Abstract    :
              This project will bring together an interdisciplinary group of                 
              thirty college teachers in ecology, biological resource                        
              management, mathematics, and statistics.  In the Summer 1993                   
              workshop at the University of Montana participants will learn                  
              about the uses of mathematical and computer modeling as tools                  
              for the science of conservation biology through lectures,                      
              colloquia, hands-on computer projects and twice-weekly field                   
              trips designed to examine major conservation issues. During the                
              1993-94 academic year at their home institutions, participants                 
              will explore applying the concepts and methods of the workshop                 
              in collaborative classroom projects and scholarly activities.                  
              In a six-day follow-up session at the University of Wyoming                    
              Research Center in Summer 1994 participants will report to                     
              workshop colleagues and evaluate their experiences.
