Abstract    :
              The project begins with a meeting of directors of recent and                   
              current NSF-funded projects in statistics education and                        
              approximately ten other individuals with relevant interest and                 
              expertise.  The principal goal is for directors to exchange                    
              information about their projects, with an explicit focus on                    
              ways the more adventurous aspects of each project can enrich                   
              the thinking of other project directors about their won                        
              projects, and wats to use evaluation and assessment, in the                    
              spirit of statistical process control, to enhance the                          
              effectiveness of the projects while they are still in progress.                
              Follow up activities include guided electronic mail conferences                
              among the participants and the incorporation of the fruits of                  
              the face-to-face and electronic conferences into a report to be                
              distributed electronically to the statistics community.  In                    
              addition, the report and excerpts from the report will be                      
              submitted to appropriate publications.
