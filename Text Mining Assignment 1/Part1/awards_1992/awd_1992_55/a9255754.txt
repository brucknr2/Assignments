Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This proposal seeks funds to enhance the skills of                             
              mathematics and science teachers in the middle school.  The                    
              project is a three year program involving a total of 160                       
              middle school teachers in an integrated approach to                            
              improving science and mathematics instruction in middle                        
              schools.  It will provide pairs of educators, a science                        
              teacher and a mathematics teacher, from participating middle                   
              schools in the Jacksonville State University area in a six-                    
              week summer institute.  During the summer institute program,                   
              participants will take courses which will include topics in                    
              mathematics, and laboratory experience.  The courses will be                   
              taught by teams of mathematicians, educators, and a                            
              laboratory assisted scientists and will emphasize                              
              applications and ways to achieve desirable solutions and                       
              conclusions through skillful reading techniques.  The                          
              science course will allow participants to engage in hands-on                   
              experiments appropriate for middle school students to                          
              broaden their understanding of selected topics.  In                            
              addition, participants will attend weekly seminars involving                   
              the use of the latest technology in teaching.                                  
                                                                                             
              Cost sharing is equivalent to 10% of the NSF award.
