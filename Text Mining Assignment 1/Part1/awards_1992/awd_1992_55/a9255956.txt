Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The University of Tulsa will initiate a four-week, residential                 
              Young Scholars project in Engineering Technology for 35 students               
              entering grades 9,10.                                                          
                                                                                             
              The primary component of the program is the summer session in which            
              the scholars interact with departmental faculty, undergraduate                 
              students, and representatives from local industry.  The hands-on               
              activities will include engineering laboratory experiments,                    
              computer workshops, and a design project.  The academic year will              
              include follow-up activities designed to reinforce the students'               
              experiences in engineering.  Each of the four follow-up sessions               
              will focus on a specific issue in engineering and will include                 
              hands-on workshops conducted by industrial mentors and faculty.  A             
              major goal of the program is to increase awareness of engineering              
              as a career potential for Native American, minority, and women                 
              students.  A high priority is given to students with high potential            
              for engineering but with limited prior exposure to engineering or              
              science.
