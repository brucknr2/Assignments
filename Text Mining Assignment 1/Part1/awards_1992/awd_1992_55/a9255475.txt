Abstract    :
              Physics Laboratory Focus-1993, a 2-day national workshop on                    
              high school and undergraduate physics laboratories is being                    
              organized for presentation on August 6-8, prior to the 1993                    
              Summer Meeting of the AAPT in Boise, ID.  Participation is                     
              being limited to 125, including 36 invited papers chosen by a                  
              review committee.  Participants will be chosen on the basis on                 
              their primary teaching levels (split between high school,                      
              introductory, and advanced labs), their record of laboratory                   
              experience, and geographical distribution.
