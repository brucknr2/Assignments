Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                                                                                            
              The purpose of this planning proposal is to investigate the                    
              feasibility of the Sea Education Association (SEA) providing                   
              a preservice teacher preparation.  The SEA will link with                      
              institutions that have teacher preparation programs.  This                     
              pool of institutions have a long standing relationship with                    
              SEA in the area of undergraduate science instruction.  SEA, as                 
              the only institution offering undergraduate programs combining                 
              the rigorous study of science with the practical application                   
              of classroom work at sea, offers a distinctive educational                     
              model.  It is proposed that the experience gained in educating                 
              students in "real life: science experiences aboard ship can be                 
              utilized in preparing teachers.  The staff will visit teacher                  
              preparation programs in order to assess just how to integrate                  
              the existing program into a teacher preparation program.
