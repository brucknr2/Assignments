Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The University of Texas at Austin conducts three series of Summer              
              Science Camps annually for 150 African-American and Hispanic                   
              youths entering the eighth and ninth grades.  Designed to build a              
              coherent and solid foundation among minority middle schoolers for an           
              interest in and understanding of science and mathematics, these                
              programs are presented in the context of existing Outreach Centers             
              established by the University in major concentrations of target                
              minorities in Austin, Dallas, and the Rio Grande Valley.  The SSC              
              environment and activities are designed to bring the participant into          
              immediate and personal contact with the people and "things" of                 
              science, mathematics and technology by having them participate in a            
              wide range of research processes and interacting with active                   
              mathematicians, engineers and scientists.  The focus of each of the            
              SSC's curricula is embodied in a major yearly theme for each site that         
              is derived from the particular nature of local student populations and         
              the available resources of that area (e.g. basic foundations, robotics         
              and space technology, ecology/plant/animal study, and agribusiness             
              and genetic engineering, etc.).  SSC student participants will interact        
              with teachers trained in teacher enhancement programs, thus                    
              matching the middle schoolers with trained science and mathematics             
              teachers that they will likely encounter in upper middle and high              
              school.  The ultimate designed outcome of this interaction is the              
              creation of "student-teacher allies" in the academic-year classroom            
              who are bound together by both shared interest and common                      
              experience in the science and mathematics learning process.
