Abstract    :
              MIT is conducting a second two-week summer workshop for 40                     
              college and university physics teachers to exchange ideas and                  
              designs for advanced pedagogical experiments in modern physics                 
              and to study the experiments currently in use in the MIT Junior                
              Physics Laboratory for the purpose of evaluating them for                      
              possible reproduction and use in similar courses at their home                 
              institutions. The MIT Junior Lab experiments are designed for                  
              students who have completed an introductory course in modern                   
              physics and are taking concurrently an introductory course in                  
              quantum mechanics. The experiments provide hands-on experience                 
              with the phenomena of particle, nuclear, atomic, condensed                     
              matter, statistical, and astrophysics. This second summer                      
              workshop, like the first one held in 1992, will assist the                     
              national effort to improve the quality of undergraduate physics                
              education.
