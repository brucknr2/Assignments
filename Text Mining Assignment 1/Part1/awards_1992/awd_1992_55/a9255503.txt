Abstract    :
              The two five-day, regional workshops will each provide 30                      
              faculty teaching introductory analytical chemistry courses at                  
              two- and four-year colleges with information on recent advances                
              in the separations sciences, and with hands-on experiences with                
              state-of-the-art separations techniques that have been or are                  
              becoming widely used in analytical and bioanalytical chemistry.                
              Experiments emphasizing biological applications will include                   
              the separation of enantiomeric mixtures of pharmaceuticals;                    
              peptide mapping; separations of serum ions by capillary                        
              electrophoresis; and the detection of DNA adducts. The final                   
              day will include a round-table discussion of how the                           
              information presented during the workshops can be transferred                  
              to the classrooms of the participants.
