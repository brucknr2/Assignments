Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The University Corporation for Atmospheric Research will                       
              convene a workshop on August 10-12, 1992 to creare a                           
              comprehensive plan for Project Skymath, a program based on the                 
              success of UCAR's Unidata program.  Unidata distributes                        
              weather and atmospheric data to universities and colleges in                   
              a format that facilitates computer manipulation of these data;                 
              skymath proposes to do the same for the nation's pre-                          
              collegiate schools.  Skymath participants includes nationally                  
              known and respeted math eduators at all levels,                                
              mathematicians, and data transfer and matherials development                   
              specialists.  This team will develop lassroom materials that                   
              utilize daily weather and climate data in the teaching of                      
              mathematics at K-12 schools with an initial focus on grades                    
              5-8.                                                                           
                                                                                             
              Plans for Project Skymath include the introduction of the                      
              Skymath materials to in- and pre-service teachers across the                   
              countryl  Lesson plans will follow the standards of the                        
              National Council for Teachers of Mathematics (NCTM).  For                      
              example, students will collect and record real-time data; will                 
              organize, manipulate and graph these data; and will learn to                   
              explore functions that rule these graphs.  Skymath will help                   
              students to become active learners, incorporating mathematics,                 
              physics, atmospheric sciences, earth and environmental scienes                 
              and computer technology.
