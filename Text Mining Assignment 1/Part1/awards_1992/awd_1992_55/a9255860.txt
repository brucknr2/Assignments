Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This planning grant seeks to expand a National Science                         
              Foundation Teacher Enhancement Program, Idaho SOARS (Science                   
              Objective Assessment and Resuructuring System), to provide                     
              for the identification of K-12 leadership teams throughout                     
              Idaho school districts with special emohasis on urban and                      
              suburban schools.  The project will utilize and evaluate a                     
              school science improvement system.  The Planning Grant will                    
              allow the SOARS II team to do the following: (a) Revise the                    
              rural SOARS assessment instrument to better model urban and                    
              suburban schools; (b) Provide state-wide meetings to                           
              identify schools interested in and willing to fully engage                     
              in the SOARS II process for site based changes in science                      
              education; (c) Identify and refine teacher-as-leader                           
              materials for use in SOARS II; and (d) Establish a broad-                      
              based network of business and industry support for the SOARS                   
              II process.
