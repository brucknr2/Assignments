Abstract    :
              A six-day workshop for undergraduate general chemistry teachers                
              will introduce participants to the LIMSport program, a cost-                   
              effective implementation of computer data acquisition and                      
              reduction in the laboratory. LIMSport allows direct data                       
              acquisition into a spreadsheet.  Since standard hardware and                   
              software (Lotus 1-2-3) are used, both the program and the                      
              individual student experiments are easily shared.  Faculty will                
              have hands-on experience with interfacing and an opportunity to                
              adapt laboratory experiments to the LIMSport format.
