Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This document proposes the development of a permanent Summer                   
              Institute in the Department of Information and Computer Science at             
              the University of California, Irvine.  The main objective of this              
              Institute will be to increase the participation of underrepresented            
              minority students in Computer Science.  The Institute, which is                
              based on a pilot project organized for the Summer of 1992, will                
              target specifically students at 2 year institutions and encourage              
              them to continue their Computer Science education at a 4-year                  
              institution, such as UCI.                                                      
                                                                                             
              The Institute will offer a comprehensive 6-week program consisting             
              of the following major components:  (1) a set of three courses - an            
              introductory computer science course, a study skills course, and a             
              career development curse; (2) a corporate internship with one of               
              Southern California's major computer-related firms; a variety of               
              inter-and cross-cultural experiences, structured into three main               
              chapters of the Institute - Native American, African American, and             
              Chicano/Latino Chapters.  The target population will be 60 students            
              each year Chapter.                                                             
                                                                                             
              The Institute will be co-sponsored by the ICS Department, the                  
              Corporate partners, and the UCI-based CAMP project.  The Institute             
              will complement the broad overall objectives of CAMP by providing              
              a focused and highly-structured program for the Computer Science               
              discipline.
