Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Twin Cities Public Television (TCPT) purposes to develop                       
              "Newton's Apple Multimedia Collection" from their unique                       
              collection of multimedia-based science instruction materials                   
              built from the successful PBS series.  These materials will                    
              be designed to stimulate creativity and improve the quality                    
              of teaching and learning for all grade levels.                                 
                                                                                             
              This pilot project will include three discs of 25 to 30                        
              segments selected from over 200 in the areas of physical, life and             
              earth sciences.  Technology education will be included in many of              
              the video segments and addressed in greater detail                             
              in the printed support materials.  Each segment will                           
              be from 5 to 10 minutes to supplement active classroom                         
              learning.  It will include the development of video teacher                    
              workshops, printed teacher support materials and computer                      
              software.  The video discs will be produced in Spanish and                     
              English and a videodisc version for the hearing impaired.                      
                                                                                             
              This project has a well documented rationale on conceptual                     
              change, curriculum development models, and effectiveness of                    
              videodisc technology and television usage.
