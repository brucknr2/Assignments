Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This project will develop a guidebook to assist mentoring                      
              activities of middle school math and science teachers.  The                    
              guidebook will include techniques and suggestions for                          
              effective mentoring.  The first draft will be completed by                     
              Fall, 1992.  A group of teachers in the Birmingham area will                   
              serve as mentors to teachers selected by their principals                      
              and will use the first draft to assist them.  These teachers                   
              will have already completed a separate Teacher enhancement                     
              Workshop on improvement of subject matter content, teaching                    
              skills, and mentoring.
