Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The University of North Carolina Mathematics and Science                       
              Education Network (MSEN) will initiate a four-week summer                      
              program with follow-up sessions during the academic year for                   
              480 seventh and eighth grade students called the MSEN Middle                   
              School Academy. The program is a commuter Early Alert                          
              Initiative (EAI) in mathematics and physics. Students will                     
              participate in experimental learning activities in                             
              mathematics, physics, career exploration, and communication.                   
              The program will involve industry and university scientists                    
              and engineers in classroom demonstrations, career awareness                    
              sessions, and self-development activities.
