Abstract    :
              A five-day short course is being offered twice--once in                        
              Knoxville, TN, and again in Sacramento, CA. The course                         
              introduces new techniques for designing microelectronic systems                
              that rely on rapid prototyping using field-programmable gate                   
              arrays (FPGAs). Thus, a design can be taken from initial                       
              specification to a working implementation involving all the                    
              steps in the design, debugging, and evaluation cycle.                          
              Laboratory exercises permit each participant to complete a                     
              project that can be taken home. Also, each participant receives                
              a starter kit containing class notes, reprints, sample                         
              completed projects, and instructions on how to obtain donations                
              of vendor hardware and software.
