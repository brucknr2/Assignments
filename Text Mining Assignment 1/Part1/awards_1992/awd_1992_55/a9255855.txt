Abstract    :
                    Kieve Science Camp for Girls is a one-week residential                   
              experience for 60 fourth, fifth, and sixth graders from three                  
              rural and poor Maine communities.  Building on research and                    
              the expertise of Kieve Science Camp instructors and the Kieve                  
              Leadership Decisions Institute, this program is designed to                    
              tackle issues known to stifle the confidence and enthusiasm of                 
              girls in science.  All activities will be hands-on.  Kieve                     
              recognizes the importance of informal education:  asking                       
              questions, exploring, designing, testing, trying again, and                    
              reaching decisions based on direct application and evidence                    
              will be the daily bread at camp.  Group problem-solving                        
              challenges, requiring collaboration, and risk-taking, often a                  
              new skill for girls, will be encouraged throughout the program                 
              and on the ropes and adventure course.  An important goal is                   
              a positive attitudinal shift:  girls should think science is                   
              fun, important in their lives, and that they can be full                       
              participants in the scientific world which they inhabit.  The                  
              carefully selected female instructors and staff address the                    
              importance of role models.  The inclusion of two teachers from                 
              each home school will sustain the successes of the Kieve                       
              experience and further spread the Kieve educational                            
              methodology.  Project staff will document and evaluate this                    
              program for the purpose of replication.
