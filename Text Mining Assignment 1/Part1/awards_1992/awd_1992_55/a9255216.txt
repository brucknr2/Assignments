Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Founded in 1979, the Science Skills Center (SSC) is a non-profit               
              community based program which encourages young minority and                    
              female students to pursue careers in science, mathematics, and                 
              technology.  At its current two sites in Brooklyn, N.Y., approximately         
              400 students, ages six to eighteen, are enrolled in programs where             
              they take accelerated courses in biology, chemistry, physical science,         
              rocketry, oceanography, botany, and mathematics.  This summer                  
              science camp expands two of the existing sites to include an                   
              additional total of one hundred and fifty African-American and Hispanic        
              middle school students.  At one site, the Summer Science Institute, a          
              group of students spend one week in each of six areas (i.e. chemistry,         
              biochemistry, biology, botany, computers,electronics and                       
              chess/mathematics).  Students also take weekly field trips to                  
              museums or engineering firms.  At another site, the Science Skills             
              Center and IBM have developed an engineering BASE (Building                    
              Access to Science Enrichment) program, a program whose goal is to              
              expose talented minority youth to careers in engineering.  Students get        
              to observe first-hand science principles at IBM's Brooklyn facility and        
              receive instruction from IBM engineers in several courses including            
              systems architecture, chemical and electrical engineering and                  
              computer science.
