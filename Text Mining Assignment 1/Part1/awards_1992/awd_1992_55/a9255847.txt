Abstract    :
              This project will support the dissemination of curricular                      
              developments in engineering by establishing workshops at three                 
              A.S.E.E. regional meetings to be attended by engineering                       
              faculty from two and four-year institutions in each region.                    
              Successful projects will be presented by principal                             
              investigators in an interactive format under the A.S.E.E.                      
              auspices.  Evaluating of the workshops with respect to their                   
              effectiveness in promoting curricular change will be carried                   
              out by the A.S.E.E. over the six month period following the                    
              regional meetings.  Results of the project will be published in                
              A.S.E.E. publications.
