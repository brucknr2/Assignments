Abstract    :
              Louisiana Collaborative for Excellence in Teacher                              
              Preparation (LaCEPT)                                                           
              The Louisiana Collaborative, an integral part of the Louisiana                 
              Systemic Initiative Program (LaSIP), will engage  the efforts of               
              key stakeholders to institutionalize statewide reform of teacher               
              education in mathematics and science. The specific goals of LaCEPT             
              are to 1) establish a statewide consortium of key partners; 2)                 
              deepen understanding of reform issues; 3) develop a statewide                  
              strategic plan; 4) establish partnerships between school and                   
              college sectors; 5) reorder campus priorities and faculty rewards              
              systems; 6) redesign preservice courses in mathematics, science and            
              methods; 7) revise instructional materials; 8) increase the number             
              of certified teachers in science and mathematics, focusing on                  
              underrepresented groups; 9) expand the boundaries of research and              
              practice; 10) maintain national standards for teacher performance              
              as students progress from preservice to certification to extended              
              service.  The signature program of LaCEPT will be sponsorship of               
              campus-based renewal projects at Louisiana's public and private                
              colleges and universities. Each campus will develop a plan for                 
              long-term systemic renewal and will fashion a distinctive proposal             
              engaging mathematics, science and education faculty in the redesign            
              of curriculum, instructional materials, assessment; mentorships and            
              internships, partnerships with schools; research and technology                
              centers; precollege recruiting of potential teachers; revision of              
              certification standards.
