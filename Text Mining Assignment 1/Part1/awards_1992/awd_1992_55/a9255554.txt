Abstract    :
              The Workshops teach a series of computer graphics and software                 
              development skills to organismic biology faculty, to enable                    
              participants to independently develop multimedia instructional                 
              materials, and to incorporate these skills into undergraduate                  
              laboratories.  These skills include technical illustration,                    
              two-dimensional animation, solid modeling and three-dimensional                
              animation, photorealistic rendering, single-frame and                          
              continuous video digitization, video compression, sound                        
              digitization and editing, video micro- and macrophotography,                   
              video photography under field conditions, and simulation                       
              modeling.***//
