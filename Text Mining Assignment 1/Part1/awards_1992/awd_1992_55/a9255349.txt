Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The Chattanooga Public School System will institute a policy                   
              of continuous improvement and renewal aimed at insuring that                   
              every graduate is fully prepared for his or her selected                       
              career path.  Particular stress will be placed on careers in                   
              technology, math and science.  Key to this project is the                      
              training and implementation of instruction planning teams in                   
              each school.  Analogous to quality circles this small group                    
              of teachers an students will meet every week to reflect on                     
              the current pattern of curriculum and instruction and design                   
              changes to it.  Every teacher, and a selected group of                         
              students, will participate in one planning team.                               
              Coordination of efforts among teams and across schools will                    
              be facilitated through a computer bulletin board network.                      
              National Science Foundation funds will be used for initial                     
              training of the teams and curriculum committee; for                            
              purchasing equipment, materials and services necessary to                      
              implement innovative instructional strategies; and for other                   
              "star-up" costs.  Once instituted the teams will be self-                      
              regenerating and schools will be restructured to make                          
              planning team activity a permanent part of regular school                      
              activity.
