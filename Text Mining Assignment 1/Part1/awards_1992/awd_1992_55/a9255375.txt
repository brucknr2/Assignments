Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This case study seeks to understand how teachers are                           
              themselves changed as they take on the role of researcher in                   
              their secondary mathematics classrooms.  Using collaborative                   
              instructional strategies, technology, and journal writing,                     
              these teachers initiate changes in classroom practice for                      
              their students consistent with the goals of the Standards.                     
              By researching student learning within their classrooms,                       
              these teacher/researchers create environments for their own                    
              learning as well.  This interactive process, framed by the                     
              immediate experience of classrooms, changes teacher beliefs                    
              and therefore teacher goals about the teaching and learning                    
              of mathematics.  This process leads to a reflective                            
              orientation that sustains continued professional growth and                    
              change.
