Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Boston University will initiate a six-week, residential,                       
              Young Scholars project in mathematics for 60 students                          
              entering the 10th, 11th, and 12th grades.                                      
                                                                                             
              The heart of this summer year program is the experience                        
              gained by students through their individual and collective                     
              efforts to solve an assortment of challenging problems in                      
              Number Theory.  Students also will study Abstract Algebra,                     
              Algebraic Curves, and Combinatorics.  Diverse weekly guest                     
              lectures introduce participants to related scientific                          
              fields, philosophical and ethical questions, and career                        
              options in mathematics and science.
