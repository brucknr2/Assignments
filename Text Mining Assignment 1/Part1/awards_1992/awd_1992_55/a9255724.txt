Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The purpose of this project is to develop teaching materials that              
              will allow high school teachers to introduce various concepts from             
              dynamical systems theory and fractal geometry into the high school             
              curriculum.  The project will include the development of                       
              approximately fifteen modules, each dealing with a single topic                
              from fractal geometry or dynamical systems.  Some modules will be              
              able to be used independently; some will be developed to be used in            
              a sequence of successive class sessions.                                       
                                                                                             
              Each module will contain background materials, preliminary student             
              worksheets, a short video, and suggested followup activities.                  
              Specific materials to be developed include videotapes, software,               
              Hypercard stacks, worksheets, and teacher guides.  The aim is to               
              help teachers show students the vitality of modern mathematics with            
              material that complements and enhances the standard high school                
              curriculum.                                                                    
                                                                                             
              Also planned is a two-week Summer Institute to train teachers to               
              bring these ideas from modern mathematics into their classrooms.
