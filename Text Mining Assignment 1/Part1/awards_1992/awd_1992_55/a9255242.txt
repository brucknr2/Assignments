Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                                                                                            
              Michigan University seeks funds to investigate what is                         
              involved in trying to teach mathematics for understanding in                   
              an elementary classroom, and to develop tools for inquiry into                 
              and communication about this kind of teaching.  The project                    
              has three interrelated purposes:  to study the kind of                         
              mathematics teaching and learning envisioned by the current                    
              reforms; to construct new approaches for teachers and teacher                  
              educators to learn about this kind of teaching;  and to                        
              educate teacher educators in reforming the aims, content, and                  
              discourse of teacher education.  The proposers will develop a                  
              collection of scenarios/vignettes of elementary mathematics                    
              classrooms, and will place them into a hypermedia environment                  
              for investigation and use by other mathematics educators.                      
              These materials will contribute to understanding teacher/                      
              student dialogues and classroom interactions and will help                     
              researcher learn more about how children construct                             
              mathematics. The implications for teacher preparation include                  
              the use of materials for instruction in courses for teachers,                  
              both preservice and inservice.  In addition, the instructors                   
              of the courses for teachers will learn from the materials,                     
              their interpretation, and the research results.                                
                                                                                             
              Cost sharing amounts to over 12% of NSF funding.
