Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Memphis State University seeks to provide a four-week                          
              commuter EAI Young Scholars Program in mathematics and                         
              physics for a group of highly promising African American                       
              entering 9th grade from the Memphis area. The program will                     
              provide 16 participants with research and career exploration                   
              experiences through classroom and laboratory activities,                       
              field trips, and interaction with various professionals in                     
              science and engineering fields. A major goal of the program                    
              is to stimulate career interest in mathematics and science                     
              through the use of algebra, geometry, trigonometry, and                        
              aspects of physics to examine specific laboratory and field                    
              problems.
