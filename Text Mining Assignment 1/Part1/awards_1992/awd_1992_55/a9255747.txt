Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This project, sponsored by the American Psychological                          
              Association in cooperation with the Council of Scientific                      
              Society Presidents, will hold a conference which will                          
              examine current research in psychology, science education                      
              and mathematics education and discuss how it can be applied                    
              to improve learning and teaching of science and mathematics                    
              in grades K-12.  The findings and recommendations of the                       
              conference will be disseminated to teachers and researchers                    
              and will help bridge the gap between research and its                          
              application in the classroom.
