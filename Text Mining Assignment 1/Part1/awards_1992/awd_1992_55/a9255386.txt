Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This project is a one year program to conduct a conference                     
              entitled "Basic Biological Concepts: What Should the World's                   
              Children Know?", in association with a meeting of The Commission               
              for Biological Education of the International Union of Biological              
              Sciences. The meeting will be held in Colorado Springs, Colorado               
              during September, 1992. Participants will include Commission                   
              members, U.S. leaders in science education and invited                         
              science\biology teachers. Previous to the conference, Commission               
              members will prepare papers describing standards for biology\life              
              sciences that have been adopted in their countries. They will                  
              define, from their country's perspective, what students should                 
              know and be able to do (K-12) and describe the extent to which                 
              these goals are being attained. This meeting will provide a                    
              unique opportunity to explore the essential elements of biology                
              curriculum from a world-wide perspective and will augment the                  
              work of the National Research Council's National Committee on                  
              Science Education Standards and Assessment. Proceedings of the                 
              symposium will be developed, published, and distributed.                       
                                                                                             
              Cost sharing equals 23.9% of the NSF award.
