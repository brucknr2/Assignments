Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Project Tellus is developing six (6) multidisciplinary video                   
              modules on global environment change concerns and issues                       
              that are indigenous to the Gulf of Mexico.  For this                           
              project, information is synthesized for module production                      
              from Sea Grant staff, classroom teachers, university                           
              scientists, state agency specialists and recent research                       
              results and findings on global change.  The 6 modules are                      
              designed around general topics as follows:  scientific                         
              process, climatic change, biodiversity, sea level rise,                        
              exotic species and water quality.  Classroom teachers are                      
              extensively involved in the writing, development, and                          
              dissemination of the materials.
