Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The American Institute of Physics (AIP) and the American                       
              Association of Physics Teachers (AAPT) are hosts to the XXIV                   
              International Physics Olympiad in Williamsburg, VA in July                     
              1993.  The Olympiad, held annually in a different country,                     
              provides opportunity for five students from each of about                      
              forty countries to participate in an international                             
              competition.  The Olympiad is a seven day event which                          
              consists of a theoretical examination of three questions to                    
              be answered in five hours and an experimental investigation                    
              to be done in about four hours.  Also included in this                         
              Olympiad are field trips to Busch Gardens, Williamsburg and                    
              CEBAF, time to interact, and ceremonial events.  The                           
              examination are critiqued, translated, graded and discussed                    
              with the team leaders during the Olympiad.  The selection                      
              process in the US gives opportunity for over 600 students                      
              and their teachers to become acquainted with the world class                   
              standards.  The AIP does the fund raising and the AAPT                         
              plans, organizes and implements the Olympiad.  Problems used                   
              to select the US team will be published in a magazine for                      
              physics teachers to demonstrate world-class problems.
