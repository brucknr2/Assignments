Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This project builds on Phase I of the Interactive                              
              Mathematics Project.  A new three-year high school                             
              mathematics curriculum, which embodies the NCTM Standards                      
              was developed, pilot tested, and two years field tested with                   
              diverse populations during Phase I.  This new secondary                        
              mathematics curriculum eliminates tracking compleely and has                   
              proven to be effective with all students at all students at                    
              all levels.  Phase II builds on the work of Phase I by                         
              developing a fourth year curriculum; reexamining and then                      
              revising all three years with the goal of improving                            
              continuity; writing supplementary materials to allow greater                   
              teacher flexibility in meeting the wide range of student                       
              needs; conducting a thorough evaluation of the effectiveness                   
              of the curriculum; assessing the various models of teacher                     
              inservice; and disseminating the program widely through                        
              large regional centers.
