Abstract    :
                   SRI International, Inc. in collaboration with the Consortium              
              for Policy Research in Education (CPRE) and Policy Studies                     
              Associates will conduct an evaluation of the Statewide Systemic                
              Initiative Program (SSI).  They will conduct three central data                
              collection activities.  First, they will track the progress of the             
              individual SSI projects through regular interaction with the state             
              evaluators and an annual survey of principal investigators to                  
              obtain uniform and comparable data about project budgets and                   
              activities.  In addition, each SSI state will be assigned to a                 
              particular individual on the staff who will be responsible for                 
              updating information about the project.  Second, case studies will             
              be conducted in several states.  Third, a system of indicators of              
              the state of science, mathematics, and engineering education will              
              be built and maintained.  Whenever possible, all 50 states will be             
              included.
