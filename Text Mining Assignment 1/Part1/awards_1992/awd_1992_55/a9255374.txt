Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Given the national importance of increasing the number of                      
              minority students who persist in math, science, engineering,                   
              premedicine, and predentistry, Phase I investigated why some                   
              such students follow through with their plans to major in                      
              MSE fields and others do not.  Data were retrieved from the                    
              1985 College Board files of 5,602 students with SAT math                       
              scores of 550 or above.  All were minority students except                     
              for a comparison sample of 404 White students.  (In Phase                      
              II, 688 Asian American students were added.)  In 1987, a                       
              first followup was conducted.  Sixty-one percent of the                        
              minority students had enrolled in college and were majoring                    
              in MSE, in comparison with 55% of the White students and 70%                   
              of the Asian American students.  In Phase III, a booklet                       
              based on the results was prepared for high school students.                    
              In Phase IV, the original sample was resurveyed, five years                    
              after high school graduation.  Fifty-four percent were still                   
              studying or employed in MSE fields.  The purpose of Phase V                    
              will be to conduct a comprehensive in-depth analysis of the                    
              entire data file, including path analyses with corrections                     
              for attenuation, as well as logistic regressions to predict                    
              the probability that a student with a given academic and                       
              personal profile will persist in MSE.  Models will be                          
              developed and tested on the sample as a whole and for each                     
              gender-by-ethnic group, so far a sample sizes permit, and                      
              for scientists, engineers, and M.D.s separately.
