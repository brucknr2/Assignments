Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This planning grant seeks to develop a proposal for the                        
              enhancement of teachers in the life sciences and health in                     
              Prince Georges County, Maryland.  The overall objective of                     
              the proposal is to improve the quality of science                              
              instruction in grades 4-8 by forming a partnership between                     
              the school system, Howard University professionals and                         
              community based scientific and technological personnel.                        
              During the twelve months planning period the proposal                          
              working sessions will be arranged to assess science teachers                   
              needs in the County, formulate proper evaluation, plan the                     
              kinds of instruction teachers want and need at the                             
              university level and training in mentorship.  During the                       
              planning period the proposal will seek clear commitment from                   
              the county school system in the planning of the partnership                    
              to train a corps of mentor teachers and will use classroom                     
              teachers in planning project activities in science along                       
              with community based institutions.                                             
                                                                                             
              An outcome of the planning period will be the design of a                      
              proposal that will have the following objectives:  The                         
              development of a program to broaden and strengthen                             
              pedagogical and technological knowledge to science teachers;                   
              the development of hands-on laboratory experiences for                         
              teachers and make provisions for these experiences to be                       
              translated to classroom activities; and the development of a                   
              strong partnership formation between the school system,
