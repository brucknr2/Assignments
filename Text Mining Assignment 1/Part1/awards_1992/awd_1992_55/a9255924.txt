Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Cornell University will initiate a six-week, residential,                      
              Young Scholars project in environmental sciences for 20                        
              students entering the 12th grade and 4 high school teachers.                   
                                                                                             
              This summer program will include a one-week orientation at                     
              Cornell's Arnot Forest, a five-week on-campus component                        
              focusing on research, careers, community outreach, and                         
              science ethics, and follow-up activities in schools, after-                    
              school science clubs, 4-H clubs, and other informal                            
              educational settings.  A six-week MSTP component will be                       
              included, through which science teachers will design                           
              research curricula and kits which will enable them to                          
              continue their research with students in classrooms and                        
              after-school science clubs.
