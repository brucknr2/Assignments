Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This modular, tenth-grade biology curriculum redefines                         
              biology instruction so that the teaching of biology                            
              encompasses new concepts and technologies, is socially                         
              relevant, is accessible and stimulating, and builds on the                     
              natural connections between biology, health-related issues                     
              and society.  Taken together the six modules constitute a                      
              complete curriculum, which is interactive, hands-on, and                       
              inquiry-based, in which information is integrated into a                       
              coherent and related set of concepts which are relevant to                     
              students' lives and experiences.  The modules integrate                        
              concepts and themes of biology in topics such as infections                    
              diseases, cancer, plants as food and medicine, habitat                         
              growth, mitochondrial Eve, and your body, yourself.  The                       
              biological concepts of cell and molecular biology,                             
              evolution, energy and metabolism, development, reproduction                    
              and heredity, ecology and human biology are woven into                         
              themes of systems and interactions, energy and matter,                         
              evolution and patterns of change, diversity and variation,                     
              and structure and function.  Each module contains a                            
              teacher's guide, students materials and performance                            
              assessment strategies and instruments, A Curriculum Planner                    
              provides assistance in implementing the curriculum and also                    
              a set of recommendations for program adopters for                              
              introducing and implementing the materials into the school                     
              system.  The materials are developed by EDC in collaboration                   
              with distributors, evaluators, teachers and school                             
              districts.
