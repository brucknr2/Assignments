Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Michigan State University's Physics-Astronomy Department will host             
              the seventh National Conference of Black Physics Students (NCBPS)              
              in February 1993.  NCBPS'93 will be the continuation of a sequence             
              of such annual conferences that began in 1987.  The motivation for             
              the NCBPS is to assist and encourage those African-American                    
              students who have shown interest and ability in physics to enter               
              and complete Ph.D. programs, and to initiate research careers in               
              Physics.  The idea for this conference series came from African-               
              American physics graduate students, and the conferences have been              
              organized and executed by students, with faculty and staff                     
              assistance at the host institutions (Howard, MIT, Hampton, Southern            
              University and Stanford hosted the conference in the                           
              past).  The following data illustrates the level of participation              
              by students from 1987 through 1992.

              *(50 additional applicants were turned away due to lack of funds)              
                                                                                             
              The format of the conference includes lectures by distinguished                
              physicists, research papers by current Black graduate and                      
              undergraduate students, and workshops on applying to and                       
              successfully completing a graduate program in physics.  The primary            
              audience for the conference are undergraduate students who are                 
              majoring in physics, or who have expressed an interest in physics.             
              A principal goal of the conference is to permit these students, who            
              are in the process of making career decisions that will shape the              
              course of their working lives, to meet and interact with Black                 
              graduate students, and Black scientists who can serve as role                  
              models and mentors.  The conference will be financed by grants from            
              MSU, corporate gifts solicited by MSU's College of Natural Science             
              Development Office, and grants which are being requested from                  
              NSF,NASA, DOE, and ONR.                                                        
                                                                                             
              The organization and program of the conference will be arranged by             
              the faculty, staff and graduate students, African-American and non-            
              African-American, of the Department of Physics and Astronomy of                
              Michigan State University with assistance from the National                    
              Executive Committee of Minorities in the Physical Sciences (MIPS).
