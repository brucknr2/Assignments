Abstract    :
              Mathematics of America Association (MAA) is developing a new                   
              publication called MATH HORIZONS (MH), a quarterly magazine for                
              students enrolled in undergraduate mathematics courses and                     
              advanced high school students.  Students would be significantly                
              involved in the publication, which would have articles on a                    
              variety of mathematics topics, include problem sections, and                   
              provide career information.
