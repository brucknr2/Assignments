Abstract    :
              9255272  Wilson       This proposal from Mark Wilson and Raymond Adams is
              intended  to develop a new testing technology that focuses on student 
              constructed understandings of mathematics.  It is a psychometric  study to
              develop multidimensional models of sufficient flexibility  to examine test
              issues of reliability, validity, and equity.  The  investigators use a
              methodological approach within Item Response  Theory using recent performance
              tests carried out in California and  Melbourne Australia.  The project would
              extend measurement models  to incorporate multidimensionality, develop computer
              programs to  calibrate items and raters, re-analyze performance assessments in 
              mathematics to study validity of each mode of assessment, and  collect
              performance assessment data to study longitudinal aspects  of student measures.
