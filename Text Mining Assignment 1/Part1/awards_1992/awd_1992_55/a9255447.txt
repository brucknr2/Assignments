Abstract    :
              A series of nine regional, seven-day workshops are being held                  
              over a three-year period.  The workshops are designed for                      
              mathematicians who teach statistics but who may not themselves                 
              have advanced degrees in the subject. Integral to the project                  
              is structured electronic communication to network and support                  
              the participants after the workshop.  The goal of the project                  
              is to improve statistic instruction by  1) increasing emphasis                 
              on data and concepts, 2) cultivating statistical thinking, and                 
              3) fostering active learning, through alternatives to                          
              lecturing.
