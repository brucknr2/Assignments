Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The University of Iowa seeks to provide a three-week summer                    
              residential Young Scholars Program in engineering with                         
              follow-up activities during the academic year. The program                     
              will serve 60 students entering grades eleven and twelve.                      
              During the program, students will participate in a guided                      
              creative design project involving a real-world, social-                        
              technical problem. Program activities include: seminars and                    
              fact finding/observational field trips related to the                          
              project design; individual career counseling; and seminars                     
              and laboratory visits to learn more about engineering,                         
              mathematics, and the sciences.
