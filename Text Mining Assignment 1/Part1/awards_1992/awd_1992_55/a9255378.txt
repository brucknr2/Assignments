Abstract    :
              Howard University Materials Science Research Center of                         
              Excellence (MSRCE) proposes to continue its research in                        
              the fields of materials science and engineering.  This                         
              center will conduct research on artificially structured                        
              materials and wide-band gap semi conductors to produce                         
              optical and electronic devices, with emphasis on those                         
              materials that can operate at high-power levels and/or                         
              in harsh environments.  A second objective of the MSRCE                        
              is to contribute to the understanding and development of                       
              advance materials as well as provide graduate education                        
              opportunities for minorities in important fields of                            
              science.  A third objective is to maintain a                                   
              competitiveness in the age of materials for the 1990's.                        
                                                                                             
              This project meets the major goal of the Minority                              
              Research Centers of Excellence (MRCE) program:  to                             
              increase the minority presence in science and                                  
              engineering by making substantial resources available to                       
              upgrade the research capabilities of strong and                                
              productive minority institutions.  Howard University as                        
              an institution and the MSRCE program, in particular,                           
              have proven their effectiveness in addressing some of                          
              the problems which beset the national research community                       
              in materials science and engineering and in educating                          
              minority students in a high quality research                                   
              environment.
