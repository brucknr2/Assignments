Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University will                       
              initiate a four-week, residential, Young Scholars project in                   
              manufacturing engineering for 30 students entering 12th                        
              grade.                                                                         
                                                                                             
              This summer program places each participant in a series of                     
              engineering research laboratories:  manufacturing processes,                   
              computer aided manufacturing, and robotics.  Additional                        
              instruction is provided in statistics, quality control, and                    
              automatic assembly and simulation.  Field trips to                             
              industrial engineering locations are provided.  Project                        
              assignments will involve the design and manufacture of an                      
              assembled component, and control and operation of a workcell                   
              for automated assembly.
