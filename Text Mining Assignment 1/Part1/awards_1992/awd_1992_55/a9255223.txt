Abstract    :
              The Experimental Program to Stimulate Competitive Research                     
              (EPSCoR) in the State of Kansas will bring the faculty at                      
              three Ph.D.-granting universities together to work on four                     
              core subject areas:  (1) materials and chemical sciences; (2)                  
              biological sciences; (3) engineering; and (4) theoretical,                     
              mathematical and computer sciences.  The three universities                    
              which will participate are: the University of Kansas, Kansas                   
              State University, and Wichita State University.  The State's                   
              competitive research base will be strengthened with the                        
              support of the Kansas State Science and Technology Advanced                    
              Research initiative which will foster mentoring of younger                     
              faculty, increase the quality and quality of graduate and                      
              postdoctorate research students, and acquire significant                       
              pieces of research instrumentation.  Active Kansas                             
              participants in EPSCoR governance will include key university                  
              administrators and State government officers.  Over the three-                 
              year award period the State of Kansas will contribute over                     
              $8.7 million to ensure the success of the EPSCoR effort.
