Abstract    :
              This intensive six-week workshop deals with modern methods of                  
              recombinant DNA and protein analysis, aiming to provide college                
              faculty with the expertise necessary to introduce this work                    
              into their undergraduate programs.  Procedures will be                         
              consistent with research standards and will  explore low-cost                  
              techniques that are appropriate to an undergraduate  teaching                  
              setting. In addition to laboratory skills, principles                          
              underlying the methods and their extension to problems at the                  
              forefront of research will be treated.
