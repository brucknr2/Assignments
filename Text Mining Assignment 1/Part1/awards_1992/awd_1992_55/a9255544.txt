Abstract    :
              This two-year program is designed to serve as a model for the                  
              utilization of cooperative relationships between university                    
              professors and outstanding two-year college physics faculty                    
              members working together to provide professional inservice                     
              enrichment training for two-year college physics faculty in the                
              Southwestern United States.  The program focuses on recent                     
              developments in physics research, innovative physics teaching                  
              methods, and successful techniques for recruiting local                        
              minority students into two-year college science and engineering                
              programs.  The program includes an annual May Institute at                     
              Texas A&M University, academic year follow-up workshops, local                 
              projects by participants, and staff visits to participant's                    
              campuses.
