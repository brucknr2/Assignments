Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The Core-Plus Mathematics Project will develop, field-test,                    
              evaluate and, in cooperation with a publisher, nationally                      
              dissemiate a complete three-year high school mathematics                       
              curriculum for all students.  Each year the curriculum will                    
              feature multiple stands of algebra/functions,                                  
              geometry/trigonommetry, statistics/probability, and discrete                   
              mathematics connected locally by common topics and globally                    
              by the fundamental themes of data, representation, shape,                      
              and change.  The curriculum will emphasize mathematical                        
              modeling and will featue full use of graphics calculators.                     
                                                                                             
              The project willcreate a curriculum consisting of a common                     
              core of mathematical experiences for all students together                     
              with differentiated applications and extensions of core                        
              topics.  The project is a joint undertaking of development                     
              teams at Ohio state University, the University of Iowa, the                    
              University of Maryland, the University of Michigan, and                        
              Western Michigan University. //
