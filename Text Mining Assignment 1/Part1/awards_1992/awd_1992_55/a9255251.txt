Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The Hartford Alliance for Mathematics and Science Education,                   
              a coalition of businesses, educators, universities, public                     
              schools, parents, and concerned citizens, propose to expand                    
              upon ninth grade curriculum developed under a Private sector                   
              Partnership grant from fourth year, and two other courses                      
              for the fourth year for those students not planning on going                   
              to college.  These materials will be field tested in                           
              Connecticut and at five sites nationwide.  Inservice                           
              training of teachers, and evaluation are integral to this                      
              proposal.  Training videos will be produced.
