Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The University of the District of Columbia program expands                     
              the existing Science and Engineering Center's pre-college                      
              program to include sixty seventh and eighth grade minority                     
              students in a summer academic intervention commuter program.                   
                                                                                             
              Activities provide a  non- traditional learning environment                    
              that allows for participant acquisition of knowledge from                      
              hands-on mathematics, computer science and electrical                          
              engineering instruction.  Participants in this program will                    
              also participate subsequently in the Physical Science                          
              Institute, a science program for ninth through twelfth grade                   
              students.
