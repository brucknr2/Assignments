Abstract    :
              This two-part project, organized by the NSF Center for Science                 
              and Technology of Advanced Cement-Based Materials, is targeted                 
              for two- and four-year college faculty to enhance their                        
              capabilities to teach an interdisciplinary materials science                   
              approach in concrete materials to civil engineering                            
              undergraduate students. Part I is a five-day workshop                          
              integrating the materials science, engineering, and laboratory                 
              and field aspects of concrete; Part II will provide a two-day                  
              conference to assess the impact of the teaching program on the                 
              participants and their students, and examine future educational                
              initiatives.
