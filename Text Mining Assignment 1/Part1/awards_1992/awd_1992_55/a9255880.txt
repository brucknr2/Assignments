Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This project is designed to provide new explanations for classroom             
              and school factors that foster student learning of mathematics and             
              science.  It involves constructing two studies: one that examines              
              teacher interaction within schools and another that examines reward            
              structures within classrooms.  The purpose of these two studies is             
              to construct better frameworks, and thereby to validate existing               
              statistical indicators of how students learn mathematics and                   
              science once they have been exposed to the subject matter.  The                
              studies will conduct new analyses of two existing national surveys,            
              the National Educational Longitudinal Survey (NELS:88) and the                 
              Longitudinal Study of American Youth (LSAY) and will include some              
              on-site interviews with teachers.  Each of these surveys include               
              students at the middle and secondary levels of education.
