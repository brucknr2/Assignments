Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Lesley College and BBN Laboratories propose to organize an                     
              invited conference series on the use of modeling in                            
              precollege education.  The purpose is two-fold.  First, to                     
              significantly increase the level of communication among                        
              acknowledged experts in the field - concerned teachers,                        
              educational researchers, curriculum and software developers,                   
              and practicing mathematicians and scientists.  The second is                   
              to produce a research and planning agenda that policy makers                   
              can use to prioritize funding of research and implementation                   
              projects.                                                                      
                                                                                             
              A small group of key participants, representing teachers,                      
              researchers, developers, and scientists, will form the                         
              steering committee to guide in the selection of conference                     
              participants.  The two conferences will be held one year                       
              apart, with work groups established during the first                           
              conference to gather data for writing the final guide for                      
              policy makers.  Immediately after the first conference an                      
              anthology of papers contributed by invitees will be                            
              published as a statement of current understandings about                       
              using modeling and simulations in the precollege                               
              environment.
