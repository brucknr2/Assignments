Abstract    :
              A three-week workshop that emphasizes hands-on manipulative use                
              of modern tools for classroom and field activities for faculty                 
              primarily engaged in teaching introductory geoscience courses.                 
              Topics to be considered include: the use of spreadsheets and                   
              databases in the classroom; computer assisted construction of                  
              illustrations, maps, and graphs; use of US Geological Survey                   
              materials such as GLORIA, JEdI, National snow and ice data, and                
              the Ocean Atlas; earthquake modelling and analysis;                            
              volcanology; and, hydrologic management.  A field trip to Owens                
              Valley for seismic analysis of the San Andreas Fault is also                   
              planned.
