Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                                                                                            
              The Consortium for Minorities in Teaching Careers (CMTC)                       
              requests funds for a planning grant for the development of a                   
              comprehensive proposal that will increase the number of                        
              minority students to enter the teaching profession with                        
              mathematics and science specialties.  The consortium is made                   
              up of ten partner institutions of higher education which                       
              include Historically Black Institutions and Hispanic-Serving                   
              Institutions that have strong programs for minority teacher                    
              preparation.  CMTC was funded by FIPSE to conduct a program                    
              for precollege students who are considering careers in                         
              teaching.  The present request is specifically for planning a                  
              program for teacher preparation with a strong emphasis on the                  
              preparation of minority teachers.  The funds will be used for                  
              travel to meetings in order to plan the comprehensive                          
              proposal.                                                                      
                                                                                             
              Cost sharing by CMTC will be approximately 25% of the NSF                      
              funds.
