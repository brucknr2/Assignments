Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This project, sponsored by Texas A&M University, will provide stipends         
              for 15 high school teachers to do summer research with the Principal           
              Investigators of NSF sponsored research projects.  Each teacher will           
              spend eight weeks on the research projects which include the fields of         
              Chemistry, Biology, Physics, Geosciences and Engineering.  In addition         
              each week the teachers will attend seminars where teachers will share          
              their experiences, plan for classroom implementation and learn of              
              recent innovative concepts and programs in science teaching.
