Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The University of Virginia will initiate a four-week,                          
              residential, Early Alert Initiative project in mathematical                    
              modeling for 40 students entering the 7th, 8th, and 9th                        
              grades.                                                                        
                                                                                             
              This summer year program will emphasize the application of                     
              general principles of mathematical modeling in various                         
              science applications from mathematics, physics, and physical                   
              sciences.  Participants will be exposed to a variety of                        
              scientists and mathematicians using mathematical modeling in                   
              their work in order to stimulate student interest in science                   
              disciplines as possible and realistic career choices and                       
              careers.
