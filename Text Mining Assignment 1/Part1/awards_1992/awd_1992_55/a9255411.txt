Abstract    :
              The workshop will focus on lasers and their application to solving             
              chemical problems.  The offering will consist of a one-week                    
              intensive exposure to both the theory and practical application of             
              laser technology to areas of interest to all branches of chemistry.            
              The course will include:  (1) lectures on the fundamentals of                  
              lasers and related topics, (2) laboratory experiments to illustrate            
              the principles presented in lectures, (3) lectures and laboratory              
              experiments dealing with current applications of lasers to                     
              chemically interesting problems, and (4) an opportunity to engage              
              in a special project of interest to the participant, the technology            
              of which will be transportable to the participant's home                       
              institution.  A major feature of this workshop is to provide                   
              exposure to laser technology at a level appropriate for                        
              incorporation at the undergraduate level.
