Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              In this three-year project, experienced field researchers,                     
              guided by an advisory committee of leaders of the American                     
              mathematics and science education reform movement, will                        
              conduct intensive case studies of eight major reform                           
              innovations of the 1980s.  The innovations include: the NCTM                   
              standards project, Project 2061, the Urban Mathematics                         
              Collaborative, California's systemic reform of science                         
              education, Chemistry in the Community, Voyage of the Mimi,                     
              Kids Network, and Contemporary PreCalculus Through                             
              Applications.  Simultaneously, coordinated through the Center                  
              for Education Research and Innovation (CERI) of the                            
              Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD),                  
              parallel sets of case studies of elementary and secondary                      
              reform efforts in mathematics, science, and technology                         
              education will be undertaken in about 14 countries in Europe                   
              and Asia.  (The other nations will cover the research project                  
              costs in their own countries.)  Overall integration of the                     
              studies will be handled by an international steering                           
              committee.  Such integration will involve the use of a common                  
              analytical scheme and interpretive framework, and will result                  
              in a major conference and summary volume in which all results                  
              will be reported in a form suitable for dissemination to the                   
              educational research and policy communities.  In addition,                     
              there will be a published book-length report for each nation,                  
              coordinated through CERI, that will give full detail on the                    
              studies of each country.                                                       
                                                                                             
              These cross-national studies should aid policy makers in the                   
              U.S. and other nations in learning from the experience of                      
              other systems in setting and refining national goals.  This                    
              grant is co-funded by NSF and the Department of Education                      
              (Office of Educational Research and Improvement), with funds                   
              from NSF covering primarily the U.S. case studies and funds                    
              from OERI devoted primarily to the integration and                             
              interpretation of the cross-national perspective.
