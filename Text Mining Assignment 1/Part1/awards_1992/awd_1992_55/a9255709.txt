Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Based on the research on one of the participants of this                       
              workshop, children carry their most positive associations                      
              and strongest desires for future experiences with subjects                     
              encountered in their work in the arts- graphic, dramatic,                      
              plastic or mechanical.  Scientists tend to liken their work                    
              closely to that of the creative teachers with three                            
              scientist, three artists and three experts in learning                         
              theory and innovative science teaching most of whom are                        
              MacArthur Fellows who have been meeting informally over the                    
              last two years.  The workshop will produce some prototype                      
              materials on three topics which must be of common experience                   
              to middle school or high school students and be topics of                      
              current research.  These materials will be for teachers to                     
              implement in classes the following year.  The materials will                   
              have input from students in a separate, concurrent summer                      
              program at the same location.  The MacArthur Foundation is                     
              cofunding the Workshop.  The results of the Workshop may                       
              result in the production of more materials using the methods                   
              of the graphic arts in the study of science.
