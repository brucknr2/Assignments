Abstract    :
              The California Consortium for Minority Graduate Student                        
              Education Program is a partnership organization                                
              composed of the California State University and the                            
              University of California systems.  The goal of the                             
              Consortium's forum is to increase graduate school                              
              access for underrepresented minority college students.                         
              Minority students in undergraduate institutions                                
              throughout California will be provided with the most                           
              current information on graduate study opportunities.  A                        
              number of educators and administrators from federal,                           
              state and private agencies will present lectures and                           
              workshops to 500-600 undergraduate and graduate                                
              students in a one-day forum at San Jose State                                  
              University in 1992.                                                            
              The forum's objectives are i) to provide information on                        
              sources of funding for graduate study including support                        
              from MARC and MBRS programs, NSF fellowships and                               
              minority supplements on federal grants; ii) to                                 
              demonstrate more effective ways to prepare for the                             
              graduate record examination;  iii) to expose students                          
              to graduate school recruiters, and encourage them to                           
              establish an early relationship with graduate advisors                         
              in their field of research interest.
