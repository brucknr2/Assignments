Abstract    :
              Although the modern Congress is televised, recorded, and                       
              electronically indexed at Purdue University, many teachers do                  
              not know how to access this information.  The Archives has                     
              developed and maintains finding aids, indexes, and an                          
              electronic database making this unparalleled collection                        
              available for use by faculty, students, and researchers.  We                   
              will train teachers to use these modern research methods and                   
              show them how to incorporate these new research skills to                      
              improve their undergraduate teaching.
