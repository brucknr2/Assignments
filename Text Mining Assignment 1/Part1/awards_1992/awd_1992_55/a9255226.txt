Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The American Chemical Society will send twenty participants                    
              to the Twelfth International Conference on Chemical                            
              Education to be held in Bangkok, Thailand 17-21 December,                      
              1992.  Ten of these participants will be selected from the                     
              area of K-12 chemistry education; the other ten from the                       
              area of undergraduate chemistry education.  Attendance at                      
              past conferences in this series, funded in part by NSF, have                   
              been fruitful for chemustry education in the United States                     
              as a result of the interactions of people, information, and                    
              ideas.  Teachers and professors selected for this project                      
              will be assigned specific information-gathering tasks and                      
              will follow-up after the conference by disseminating the                       
              information at the local, regional, state, and national                        
              levels.  In addition, each participant will write a paper to                   
              be submitted for publication.  Ten of these papers will be                     
              selected for presentation at a 1993 meeting on science                         
              education.
