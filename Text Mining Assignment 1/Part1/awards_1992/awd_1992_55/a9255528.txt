Abstract    :
              Calvin College's Physics Department offers a one-week Diode-                   
              Laser Experiments Workshop in the summer of 1993 to physicists                 
              and chemists who wish to introduce diode-laser demonstrations                  
              and experiments in their teaching of undergraduates.                           
              Participants see a variety of experiments including high-                      
              resolution spectroscopy, the Zeeman effect, saturated                          
              absorption, optical frequency doubling, the optogalvanic                       
              effect, optical heterodyning, and Rydberg-state spectroscopy.                  
              Emphasis is on training, skills, and supports that will make                   
              these experiments replicable at participants' home                             
              institutions.
