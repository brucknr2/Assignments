Abstract    :
              9255225  Royce Ballinger  The major goal of the Nebraska EPSCoR Committee is to
              design a  practical, farsighted plan for science and engineering 
              infrastructure development and technology transfer as part of its  expanded
              responsibilities as an official science advisory board to  the Governor of
              Nebraska.  A key element of the plan is to sponsor  specific research
              enhancement programs in Behavioral Biology,  Metallobiochemistry, and Materials
              Research on Nanostructured and  Complex Systems.  Researchers from the
              University of Nebraska  Lincoln, the University of Nebraska Omaha, and
              Creighton University  will participate in the research programs.  The overall
              program  objective is to bring for the first time a logical and well ordered 
              approach for:  1) evaluating the science and engineering strengths  and needs
              of the state; 2) providing a forum for discussion between  universities, the
              state government and the private sector in  setting both short and long term
              goals, priorities and achievement  standards for research; 3) establishing
              mechanisms for evaluating  the effectiveness of the sponsored programs in
              achieving enhanced  competitiveness for Nebraska's scientists and engineers and
              in  fostering long range economic development for the state, and 4)  promoting
              science and engineering in the schools and communities of  Nebraska.   ***
