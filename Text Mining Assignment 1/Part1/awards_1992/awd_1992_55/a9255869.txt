Abstract    :
              Each year for two years, a faculty enhancement program is being                
              offered to 25 faculty members from a groups of universities and                
              two-year colleges in Puerto Rico.  As a short term goal, the                   
              program aims to introduce mathematics faculty members to the                   
              use of technology in the undergraduate mathematics classroom as                
              a way of enhancing their teaching as well as the learning                      
              experiences of their students.  Because the program is                         
              targeting academic institutions and students of modest economic                
              means, there is a focus on technology which is relatively                      
              inexpensive.  This will allow participating colleges and                       
              universities to implement what they learn on a large scale. The                
              workshop will focus on topics in precalculus and calculus.                     
              Follow-up activities are establishing a base for continued                     
              collaboration among participating institutions on issues                       
              concerning the use of technology and other curriculum matters                  
              in undergraduate mathematics education.  The program consists                  
              of three main activities:  software workshops, graphic                         
              calculator workshops, and a conference cycle.***//
