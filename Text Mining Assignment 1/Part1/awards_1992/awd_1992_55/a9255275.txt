Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This project is to host a conference on August 1-5, 1992 on the                
              issues facing the reform of algebra.  There will be approximately              
              70 participants who will be  mix of classroom teachers, mathematics            
              educators, university mathematicians, and curriculum developers.               
              Among the issues being addressed by the conference will be (1) what            
              is algebra, (2) how should assessment by changed, (3) how does                 
              algebra fit in an integrated curriculum, and (4) how can change be             
              implemented.                                                                   
                                                                                             
              This project will have participants involved in middle school                  
              curriculum reform to help interface middle school and high school              
              mathematics.  The conference will include participants from the                
              calculus reform movement to help in the interface between high                 
              school and college.  They will include participants from other                 
              countries to share worldwide ideas on reform.  The proceedings of              
              this conference will be published.
