              Michigan State University will initiate a six-week,                            
              residential, Early Alert Initiative in mathematics and                         
              physics for 60 students entering the 8th and 9th grades.                       
                                                                                             
              This summer program will select as participants African-                       
              American, Hispanic-American, and Native American middle                        
              school students from Michigan.  The program will use an                        
              informal mode with special emphasis on mathematical problem                    
              solving, experiments in physics, the use of hands-on                           
              materials, the use of technology to help solve problems in                     
              mathematics and science, and precise description of results                    
              both written and orally.  Parents are required to                              
              participate in five day long conferences.  Follow-up                           
              activities include continued work on mathematics and physics                   
              research projects.
