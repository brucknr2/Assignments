Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This proposal describes a two-day conference on evolution                      
              education to be held December 3 & 4, 1992 at Louisiana State                   
              University.  The purposes of the conference include (a) the                    
              identification of areas of needed research on evolution                        
              education, and (c) the development of a network of science                     
              educators who have a keen interest in evolution education.                     
              The conference will include 10 scientists, 10 science                          
              educators and 10 high school and middle school biology                         
              teachers, plus approximately 10 LSU faculty and graduate                       
              students.  Professional organizations (e.g., AAAS, NSTA,                       
              NABT, NARST) will be represented at the conference with the                    
              intention of encouraging further debate on important issues                    
              related to the learning of concepts important to an                            
              understanding of the overall framework of evolution.  The                      
              "products" of the conference will include, (a) 500 copies of                   
              proceedings to be distributed to organizations and                             
              individuals, (b) video-taped highlights of the conference,                     
              (c) a network of individuals who will communicate and work                     
              with conference participants, and (d) a summary of the                         
              highlights of the conference to be published in a special                      
              issue of the Journal of Research in Science Teaching devoted                   
              to evolution education research.
