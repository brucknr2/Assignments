Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The Foundation for Glacier and Environmental Research will                     
              initiate an eight-week, residential, Young Scholars project                    
              with a Mathematics and Science Teaching Perspectives                           
              component in environmental and earth sciences for 15                           
              students entering the 12th grade and 3 high school teachers.                   
                                                                                             
              This summer program will emphasize field research in                           
              Alaska's Juneau Icefield.  Students are in the field the                       
              entire period in a seven-day-a-week immersion in on-going                      
              and new research projects.  They will be involved in                           
              discussions of career possibilities and the philosophy and                     
              ethics of environmental earth science.  Involvement will                       
              continue throughout the academic year via preparation of                       
              research papers, presentations at homes schools, and through                   
              Newsletters and scheduled reunions with participants and                       
              staff.
