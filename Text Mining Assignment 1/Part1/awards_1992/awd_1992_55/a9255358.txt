Abstract    :
              This project will provide for the dissemination of the results                 
              of projects supported by the Instrumentation and Laboratory                    
              Improvement Program.  This year will note the seventh year that                
              the Division for  Experimentation and Laboratory-Oriented                      
              Studies (DELOS) of ASEE and the National Science Foundation                    
              have cooperated in holding sessions at which grantees from the                 
              Instrumentation and Laboratory Improvement Program have                        
              presented their results.  The participation of the grantees in                 
              the poster session has grown each year by on the order of fifty                
              percent, and the expected number this June will be greater than                
              sixty.  There is also an associated technical presentation                     
              session, which typically has four grantee papers and a short                   
              presentation by an NSF Program Director on the ILI program.                    
              The amount of work that the three principals have been                         
              performing has grown commensurately through the years, and this                
              proposal was solicited to support their effort on behalf of the                
              Engineering education community and the NSF ILI program.                       
              Typically, there will be about 2000 faculty attending the                      
              Annual ASEE Conference.  The presentation is becoming a                        
              fundamental component for the dissemination of the results of                  
              the ILI program for the Engineering education community.  This                 
              award allows the three principals to continue their effort, and                
              supports the anticipated increase in the amount of grantee                     
              participation in the future.  With the requested support,                      
              continued increase in faculty interest in undergraduate                        
              engineering laboratory development is expected.
