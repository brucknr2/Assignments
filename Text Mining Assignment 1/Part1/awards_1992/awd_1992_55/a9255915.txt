Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County will initiate an              
              academic year Young Scholars project in ecological research                    
              methods, data analysis and scientific writing for 20 students                  
              entering grades 10-12.                                                         
                                                                                             
              Participants will attend a 30-week course in four museum-related               
              disciplines, concentrating specifically on the natural history of              
              southern California.  Each of the four "courselets" will be taught             
              by museum curatorial staff and will include lectures, discussions,             
              lab activities and a field trip to demonstrate field research                  
              techniques.  Workshops will be conducted on research methodology               
              and project design, statistics, scientific writing and ethics in               
              science.  Students will conduct ongoing small group research                   
              projects pertaining to subject matter covered in the courselets.               
                                                                                             
              This program is designed to expose high school students to the                 
              research roles of museums, curators and other scientists and to                
              increase the students' knowledge about the educational requirements            
              for a career in the sciences.
