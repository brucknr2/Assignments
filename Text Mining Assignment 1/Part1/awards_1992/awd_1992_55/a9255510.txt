Abstract    :
              A two-week intensive workshop for college teachers of introductory             
              astronomy will offer a hands-on approach to laboratory work, both              
              indoors and with night-time observations. We will review currently             
              available laboratory resources and their adaption to the needs of              
              the participant's institutions, offer observing experience with                
              small telescopes, and bring in speakers to discuss topics currently            
              at the forefront of astronomical research. The resources of                    
              Sommers-Bausch Observatory and Fiske Planetarium, both on the                  
              campus, will be fully utilized.
