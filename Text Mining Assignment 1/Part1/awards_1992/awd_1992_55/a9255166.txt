Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The University of Texas System Alliance for Minority Participation             
              (U.T. System AMP) brings together all none universities of The                 
              University of Texas system and six closely partnering community                
              college systems to increase the number of minority students                    
              enrolling in, graduating from, and entering graduate programs in               
              mathematics, science, and engineering (MSE).  Activities will be               
              supported by partnerships with industry and national laboratories.             
                                                                                             
              Prominent among participating institutions are those in Border                 
              regions serving large numbers of Hispanic students and those in                
              metropolitan areas serving mainly commuter student, including many             
              minority students.  Goals set for the proposed AMP are:  1) to                 
              produce approximately 2,000 minority MSE B.S. graduates each year              
              by the end of the 1996-97 academic year; and 2( to enroll at least             
              500 minority graduate students per year in U.T. System                         
              universities.                                                                  
                                                                                             
              The approach proposed is characterized by: 1) high level leadership            
              for programmatic change; 2) focus on essential, "gate-keeper"                  
              science and mathematics courses; 3) substantive involvement of                 
              community college partners in curriculum efforts; 4) flexible                  
              programs for supporting minority student participation in research;            
              and 5) task forces that bring faculty leaders from different                   
              institutions together to make systemic changes in undergraduate MSE            
              education in Texas.  The proposed AMP will cooperate with the Texas            
              A&M-directed AMP, which includes seven Texas universities; other               
              major projects; and state agencies.
