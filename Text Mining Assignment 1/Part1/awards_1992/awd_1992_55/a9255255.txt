Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This study conducts further analysis of teacher background                     
              characteristics and student performance outcomes.  A relationship              
              between teacher coursework and student outcomes had been                       
              demonstrated in a previous analysis of the NELS:88 teacher                     
              transcript files by this researcher.  The current project expands              
              upon these findings by incorporating an analysis of teacher                    
              background and student performance outcomes within a broader                   
              conceptual framework.  It also seeks to improve the statistical                
              validity of the analysis, improve the transcript-based measures of             
              teacher quality, and uses additional variables from the NELS:88                
              data files to test alternative hypotheses concerning student                   
              outcomes.
