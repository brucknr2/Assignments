Abstract    :
              The University of Tennessee is offering a two-week workshop                    
              August 9-20, 1993, on Advanced Undergraduate Laboratory                        
              Experiments Using Lasers for teachers at four-year colleges.                   
              The workshop emphasizes the development and implementation of                  
              experiments utilizing lasers primarily suitable for advanced                   
              undergraduate physics and chemistry laboratories.  It is a                     
              practical, hands-on experience where the participants perform                  
              approximately ten unique laser-based experiments.  It also                     
              features three construction projects, holography, computed-                    
              aided instruction in laser safety, and field trips to several                  
              nearby laser labs.
