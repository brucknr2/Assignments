Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              A year-long physics curriculum for high school students                        
              designed to develop and integrate conceptual knowledge                         
              within problem solving contexts will be developed.  Students                   
              will interact with other students and teachers in using                        
              concepts to analyze and solve goalfree, open-ended problems,                   
              in exploring the meaning of concepts through inquiry and                       
              hands-on activities and in organizing their conceptual                         
              knowledge in ways that highlight the major ideas in physics.                   
              The proposed curriculum will be action-oriented, consistent                    
              with constructivist epistemology, and will illustrate the                      
              power of applying concepts than formulaic approaches to                        
              solving problems.  The modules will cover the standard                         
              topics in high school physics courses and can be used as                       
              supplements to other approaches or as a stand-alone                            
              curriculum.  The materials will consist of a terse student                     
              reader, module activities, hands-on/inquiry activities, and                    
              a teachers manual which contains the above plus information                    
              on preconceptions and suggestions for using other materials.                   
              This project is based both on successful pilot project which                   
              evaluated the approach in four ethnically diverse high                         
              schools and on cognitive research on learning and problem                      
              solving.
