Abstract    :
                   This proposal is for an extension of the research currently               
              being carried out by the American Mathematics Society on the                   
              recognition and rewards systems that currently exist in academic               
              departments in the mathematical sciences.  These studies are seen              
              as key to revitalizing science and mathematics education at the                
              school and undergraduate levels.  This proposal calls for                      
              ethnographic and other innovative methodologies that will offer                
              data on barriers to changing the rewards structures.  The project              
              will be carried out as a series of case studies and a survey of                
              some 3,000 mathematical sciences departments.  The results will be             
              reported to NSF and to the scientific community through the usual              
              channels of the member societies of the Joint Policy Board for                 
              Mathematics.  The project, building upon the work supported by the             
              current SGER grant, is expected to provide a critical basis for                
              subsequent investigations that will lead to recommendations and a              
              plan of action to produce recognition and rewards systems that are             
              consistent with missions and responsibilities of institutions of               
              higher education.
