Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This five year project by COMAP will produce, field test,                      
              and evaluate a three year secondary school mathematics                         
              curriculum.  This curriculum will consist of a 9-11 core                       
              which will be application and modeling based.  Materials                       
              will incorporate computer and calculator experiences, a                        
              video applications library, appropriate assessment                             
              instruments, and teacher manuals.  The materials will be                       
              developed by the project staff and a 30 member writing team                    
              including many high school teachers.  The Educational Film                     
              Center will help on video development.  Rutgers University                     
              and the University of Wisconsin at Madison will direct the                     
              field testing.  The Freudenthal Institute of the Netherlands                   
              will aid in the development of appropriate assessment                          
              strategies.
