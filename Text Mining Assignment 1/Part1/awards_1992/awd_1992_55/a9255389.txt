Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Ten teachers and science educators will attend a workshop in                   
              the United Kingdom in July, 1992 to see the Salter's Science                   
              Program in action and work with science educators there to                     
              transcribe units for tenth grade science.  The Salter's                        
              Science Program is integrated science at all grades 6-10 and                   
              uses a thematic approach.  It is particularly intriguing                       
              because some ninth grade units tested in some schools of the                   
              California Hundred Schools Project (NSTA Scope, Sequence and                   
              Coordination) have been enthusiastically received.  The                        
              units fit the SSC model and may provide exemplars for                          
              materials that need to be developed.  The workshop also                        
              addresses the needs of teachers in teaching these materials.
