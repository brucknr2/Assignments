Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Cooper Union for the Advance of Science and Art will                           
              initiate a six-week, commuter, Young Scholars project in                       
              engineering for 180 students entering the 11th and 12th                        
              grades.                                                                        
                                                                                             
              This summer program will emphasize the study of urban                          
              engineering problems.  A creative integration of classroom                     
              demonstrations, video instruction, lectures, field trips,                      
              and team-based, "hands-on" laboratory exploration of                           
              problems with Cooper Union faculty and advanced engineering                    
              undergraduates, will challenge high ability and high                           
              potential students to maintain a competitive edge in science                   
              learning, a process sustained by after-school follow-up                        
              science enhancement activities in the academic year.
