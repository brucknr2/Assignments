Abstract    :
              This conference will assist minority students in achieving                     
              excellence in the computing field and related science and technology           
              areas.  There is very little activity in the publishing of technical           
              papers by high school students.  American University has recognized            
              this deficiency and will be collaborating with the Joint Educational           
              Facility on a Computer Science Conference for high school students.            
              This conference is to be held May 30, 1992.  Students will develop             
              projects, prepare papers, and conduct demonstrations to show the               
              results of their work.
