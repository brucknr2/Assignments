Abstract    :
              The objectives of the proposed project are summarized as follows:               
                                                                                            
              (1)  Develop and implement a decision support system for resource              
              management on the NAPI, which will increase the understanding and              
              effectiveness of problemsolving, information processing and                    
              decision-making analysis related to water, land, human resources               
              and environmental protection for the NIIP.                                     
                                                                                             
              (2)  Provide an education program for Native American, Hispanic and            
              other minority students to obtain the B.S. degree and to go on to              
              graduate work in the areas of improving resource management.                   
                                                                                             
              This program will focus on:  (a) Increasing the participation of               
              minorities, women and under-represented groups in the science,                 
              engineering and agricultural economics disciplines, and encouraging            
              more students to pursue graduate studied (This will include                    
              implementing summer camps for middle school students and a regional            
              conference for high school, community college, and university                  
              students in the four corners area to encourage them to pursue a                
              career in science and engineering and to inform them about the                 
              project, to be funded by Summer Science Camps Program) and (b)                 
              Developing a teamwork learning environment that includes                       
              undergraduate students, graduate students, faculty and outside                 
              corporations (NAPI).
