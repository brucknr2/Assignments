Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Michigan State University will initiate a seven-week,                          
              multidisciplinary, residential High School Honors Science Program              
              (HSHSP) for 28 high-ability/high-potential students entering grades            
              11,12 across the nation.                                                       
                                                                                             
              During the seven-week period students will engage in independent               
              research in the laboratory of a Michigan State University faculty              
              member.  Additional activities will include seminars, discussions              
              and debates about issues of importance to their particular area of             
              research and to the broader scientific enterprise.  They will be               
              afforded opportunities to investigate careers in the sciences both             
              through organized discussions with professionals on campus and at              
              field trip sites.
