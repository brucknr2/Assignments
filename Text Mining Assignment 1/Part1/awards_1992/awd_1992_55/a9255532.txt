Abstract    :
              A short course in Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Spectrometry and                  
              Mass Spectrometry will be offered to 20 undergraduate faculty.                 
              Participants will be chosen from institutions which have                       
              recently purchased, or are in the process of purchasing, this                  
              instrumentation.  These techniques are the most widely used                    
              methods for determining molecular structure in the modern                      
              laboratory. Often the faculty have inadequate experience with                  
              the techniques and are unable to take full advantage of the                    
              instruments in their curriculum.  This course is designed to                   
              provide the participants with indepth knowledge of the                         
              fundamentals and applications of this instrumentation.  The                    
              participants will be encouraged to utilize their experience                    
              through the development of curricular modules.  The curricular                 
              modules may be used to enhance undergraduate education at their                
              home institutions in these two important chemical                              
              instrumentation techniques.  Montana State University is                       
              superbly equipped to offer this course. We have four fourier                   
              transform superconducting nuclear magnetic resonance                           
              spectrometers and five mass spectrometers. The instructors have                
              many years experience in teaching the technical applications of                
              these instruments.
