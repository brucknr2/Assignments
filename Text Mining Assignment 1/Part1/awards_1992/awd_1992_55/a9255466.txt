Abstract    :
              This program for community college physics teachers is                         
              providing four workshops at several community college campuses                 
              around the nation.  Two of these workshops introduce the use of                
              microcomputer-based laboratories in physics and another covers                 
              the development of conceptual exercises and overview case                      
              studies.  A fourth workshop provides and update and an                         
              opportunity for previous participants to work together to                      
              develop and exchange appropriate curriculum materials necessary                
              to return to their campuses and start implementing the workshop                
              ideas.  The impacts of the workshops are reinforced afterwards                 
              by a networking system and a newsletter.  These workshops                      
              facilitate the incorporation of new knowledge at community                     
              colleges which enhances their students' understanding of                       
              classical and contemporary physics.  The task of updating                      
              science education programs at community colleges is important                  
              for students (particularly women and minorities) who attend                    
              community colleges and who need to be exposed to, and gain                     
              experience with, current technology, and who need effective and                
              sensible encounters with physics education.
