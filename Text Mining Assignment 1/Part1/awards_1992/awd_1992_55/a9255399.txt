Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                                                                                            
              The National Research Council will convene a committee to                      
              explore the merit and feasibility a national infrastructure of                 
              resources capable of delivering to teachers and schools the                    
              intellectual and material resources necessary to sustain                       
              systemic reforms in science and mathematics education.  The                    
              committee, working as a whole and in focus sessions, will                      
              include the perspectives of scientists and mathematicians,                     
              science and mathematics education reforms, and others who                      
              understand the opportunities, barriers, and most promising                     
              strategies needed to mount and sustain mathematics and science                 
              education programs aligned with national goals and standards.                  
                                                                                             
              The NRC Committee will address the central questions related                   
              to the merit and feasibility of a national system to help                      
              teachers and schools achieve the national standards in                         
              mathematics and science education.                                             
                                                                                             
              The NRC Committee will explore central issues regarding the                    
              most promising "delivery system' and infrastructure"' composed                 
              of federal, state, and local governmental and nongovernmental                  
              resources--agencies, institutions, organizations, and                          
              individuals.  A final report with recommendations is expected                  
              in early 1993.
