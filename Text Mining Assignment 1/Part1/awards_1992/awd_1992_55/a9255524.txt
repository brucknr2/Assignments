Abstract    :
              Three week-long workshops on Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR)                  
              will focus on the hands-on use of a 300 MHz instrument and the                 
              interpretation of the data obtained.  Each workshop will                       
              represent a different level of sophistication in its exposure                  
              to NMR spectroscopy.  The first workshop, "Introduction to                     
              NMR", is designed for participants coming from institutions                    
              lacking NMR instrumentation or having no previous training in                  
              this level of NMR.  The second workshop, "Fourier Transform and                
              Multinuclear NMR", and the third workshop, "Advanced Pulse                     
              Sequences and Two-Dimensional NMR", are designed for                           
              participants with some background in NMR.  The teaching                        
              strategy will include lecture, computer simulation, instrument                 
              use, and data analysis, and the instructors for the course will                
              be Scott Hill and Richard Cornelius.  Follow-up sessions for                   
              participants will be held in the Fall of 1993 and May of 1994.
