Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Florida A&M University and Florida State University are                        
              collaborating to conduct a five-year program which will directly               
              involve 120 exemplary minority engineering undergraduates enrolled             
              in chemical, civil, electrical, industrial and mechanical                      
              engineering curricula.  Participants will 1) collaborate on faculty            
              research and perform research-oriented industrial internships, 2)              
              receive academic advising and mentoring by faculty researchers and             
              professional mentoring by prominent minority scientists, and 3)                
              receive academic enrichment and enhancement in preparation for                 
              graduate study.  Participants will have the opportunity to present             
              the results of their research at technical conferences.  Program               
              activities guide participants from the pre-college level to                    
              successful entry into graduate research programs.  Participants                
              receive graduated stipend supplements (in addition to any other                
              scholarships which they are receiving) which are scaled from                   
              $111/month for first year students through $333/month for fifth                
              year students.                                                                 
                                                                                             
              Successful completion of the program activities will result in the             
              acceptance into an completion of graduate research degree programs             
              by 85% of program graduates and acceptance into doctoral research              
              programs by 40% of program graduates.                                          
                                                                                             
              These results will be achieved in an extremely cost-effective                  
              manner.  Annual project costs average $3700 per participant;                   
              cumulative project costs are $11,638 per participant.  Total                   
              personnel costs are only 26% of the budget; senior personnel costs             
              are 2.3% of the budget.  Annual cost sharing by the College is 46%             
              of the funding requested from NSF.
