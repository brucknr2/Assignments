Abstract    :
              This project will explore mechanisms for producing rapid advances              
              in innovative practices for developing more effective utilization              
              of laboratory experiences in pre-college chemistry.  The findings              
              from this exploratory research will produce some immediate                     
              positive changes in practice as well as lay the groundwork for                 
              significant further study.  The results of this research will                  
              lead directly to changes in approach to the use of laboratory                  
              time and to improving attitudes on the part of school                          
              administrators concerning the value to students learning of                    
              laboratory type of experiences.  The study takes into account                  
              current understandings related to designing laboratory                         
              experiences both by professionals in the United States and in                  
              other countries.
