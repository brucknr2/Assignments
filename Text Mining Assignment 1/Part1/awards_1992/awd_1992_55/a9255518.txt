Abstract    :
              The purpose of this project is to offer a two-week workshop on                 
              Teaching Physics Using Interactive Digitized Video.  The                       
              workshop: (1) fosters a discussion and formulation of new                      
              strategies for the teaching of physics using the capabilities                  
              of interactive digitized video technology; (2) enables 30                      
              physics professors to become skilled in the use of interactive                 
              digitized video for the teaching physics courses for                           
              undergraduates; (3) helps physicists develop lessons that                      
              change the present physics content using the existing                          
              interactive digitized video software and hardware; (4) prepares                
              them to lead local, regional, and national workshops on new                    
              science content using interactive digitized video technologies;                
              and (5) makes the new interactive, digital video physics                       
              lessons developed by the workshop participants available to                    
              physics educators throughout the country.
