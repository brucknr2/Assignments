Abstract    :
              This proposal is to renew funding for a faculty enhancement                    
              workshop in molecular biotechnology. A two-week summer workshop                
              in the well-equipped laboratories and computer facilities of                   
              the Department of Biological Sciences will provide hands-on                    
              experiences in molecular biotechniques including recombinant                   
              DNA technology, protein purification, vector construction, cDNA                
              and genomic library construction for college faculty from                      
              regional two- and four-year colleges. The Workshop is designed                 
              to allow the transfer of molecular technology from the workshop                
              laboratories to the participants' home institutions. A faculty                 
              enhancement seminar series aimed at the professional                           
              development of participating college faculty will continue                     
              throughout the post-workshop year.
