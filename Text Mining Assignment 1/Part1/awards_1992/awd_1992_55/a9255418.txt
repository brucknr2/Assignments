Abstract    :
              This course presents college teachers with the newest                          
              technologies of applied optics.  Recognized experts instruct                   
              participants in digital and analog data processing, gauging,                   
              video techniques, hologram interferometry, fiber optics,                       
              metrology, scanning methods, moire methods, photoelasticity,                   
              shearography and other techniques. The latest generation of                    
              equipment is available for hands-on laboratory experimentation.                
              As a follow-on effort, the investigators will assist the                       
              participants in implementing these laboratory experiments at                   
              their home institutions.***//
