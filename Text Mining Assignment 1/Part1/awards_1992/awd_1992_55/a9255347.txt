Abstract    :
                   Improving the infrastructure associated with education                    
              statistics, mathematics and science education, and research is                 
              imperative if we are to benefit from policy decisions that are                 
              informed by expert knowledge and reliable data.  Based on the                  
              experience from its current knowledge and reliable data.  Based on             
              the experience from its current NSF/NCES grant, AERA proposes a                
              program of research and training designed to achieve two primary               
              objectives:  (a) to strengthen communications between scholars in              
              the educational research community and government administrators               
              and social scientists, and (b) to enhance the capability of the                
              research community to conduct policy and practice relevant research            
              that shape NCES and NSF missions.                                              
                   The program will consist of seven components:  (a) a training             
              program to increase the educational research community's capacity              
              to work with NCES and NSF data sets; (b) a small grants competition            
              to increase policy and practice-related research using NCES data               
              sets, with a particular emphasis on mathematics and science data;              
              (c) a visiting Senior fellows program at each agency; (d) a                    
              research fellowship program at NCES and NSF that will allow newer              
              scholars to become involved in the design, analysis, and                       
              interpretation of data; (e) an annual think tank exercise to engage            
              in strategic planning; (f) a University based evaluation and                   
              dissemination traineeship program, and (g) an invisible academy of             
              highly technical researchers to undertake a sophisticated level of             
              basic, policy, and applied research on a relevant issue.
