              Polytechnic University is an urban university located in downtown              
              Brooklyn.  Polytechnic will identify and recruit minority women                
              students from high school and from two year college programs for               
              its undergraduate programs in materials science research.                      
              Precollege students will participate in a summer research program              
              and enroll in a summer math preview/review course prior to                     
              beginning their first semester as Polytechnic undergraduates.                  
              Selected students enrolled in two year programs in the physical                
              sciences at nearby schools will also participate in the summer                 
              programs.  Students who would benefit from a  "preresearch                     
              experience" will take the Spring Forward Saturday program prior to             
              undertaking summer research.  Students in two year programs will be            
              advised and counseled to facilitate their transfer to Polytechnic              
              as upper level undergraduates.  All precollege and undergraduate               
              participants will receive advisement about academic coursework that            
              prepares them for enter into strong graduate programs.                         
              Undergraduate minority and women peer counselor/tutors will work               
              with students in small groups to enhance learning.  Students will              
              receive mentoring and counseling from faculty, graduate students               
              and undergraduate peers the research laboratory environment.                   
              Students will attend seminars, participate in visits to graduate               
              programs and to industry, and prepare oral and written reports                 
              based on research.  Upper level research students will be                      
              encouraged to give presentations at meetings of professional                   
              societies.  Students will receive assistance in preparing graduate             
              school applications.
