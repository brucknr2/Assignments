Abstract    :
                    Support is provided for a retreat in May 1992 to develop a               
              national Hispanic agenda on science and mathematics education.                 
              Participating will be leaders of Hispanic science and community                
              organizations.  During the retreat a plan of action to impact                  
              policymaking about programs that impact Hispanic science and                   
              mathematics education will be developed which will draw on                     
              discussions about barriers that inhibit Hispanic participation in              
              science and mathematics, extant "exemplary" programs that have been            
              developed to address these issues, and proposal evaluation policies            
              and processes.  A report and followup strategy will be products of             
              the retreat.
