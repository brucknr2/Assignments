Abstract    :
              The Calculus Institute is introducing college mathematics                      
              teachers to computer algebra systems and to new methods of                     
              teaching calculus using computer algebra systems.  This                        
              cooperative venture by two-year and four-year institutions, the                
              American Mathematical Association of Two-Year Colleges                         
              (AMATYC), and the Kentucky Mathematical Association of Two-Year                
              Colleges (KYMATYC) is focusing on calculus reform efforts in                   
              Kentucky.  Laboratory manuals of participants' calculus                        
              materials and a position paper on transferability will be                      
              presented to AMATYC and KYMATYC for dissemination.
