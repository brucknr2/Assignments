Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Ninety seventh and eighth grade American Indian students participate           
              in summer science camps offered at three different locations in the            
              Upper Midwest:  Duluth, Minnesota, Green Bay, Wisconsin, and Tama,             
              Iowa.  The camp curriculum focuses on natural resource management              
              issues and American Indian traditions.  Participants conduct scientific        
              research projects in cooperative groups and discuss scientific                 
              research with professional scientists (including American Indian role          
              models).  The program integrates science, mathematics and                      
              communication skills through this informal camp setting.  Project              
              follow-up includes participant newsletters that discuss school science         
              and math topics and their relevance to the summer camp experiences             
              as well as visits to camp locations for seminars with parents and              
              participants.
