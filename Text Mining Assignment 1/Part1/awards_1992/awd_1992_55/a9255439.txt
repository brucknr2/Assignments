Abstract    :
              This residential program is designed to introduce community                    
              college faculty to molecular biology and its applications.  The                
              program will draw upon the faculty and facilities of UC Davis,                 
              a leader in the field of experimental biology.  Lectures, labs,                
              and discussions will emphasize basic principles underlying                     
              recombinant DNA methodologies and issues.  A unique aspect of                  
              this program are follow-up sessions held onsite at                             
              participating community college campuses during the  academic                  
              year. Participants also have the opportunity to conduct                        
              research through an internship with a member faculty at the                    
              University of California, Davis.
