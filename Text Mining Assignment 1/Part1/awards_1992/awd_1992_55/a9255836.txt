Abstract    :
              9255836  Eubanks    Typically students are assessed in chemistry on their 
              ability to provide answers to short questions.  These tests  measure neither
              the materials instructors feel students  should learn nor the level of student
              understanding of  concepts or student mastery of a particular concept.  Only 
              in the laboratory have assessments been made on the basis of  integrated
              activities, but laboratories come under attack  for other reasons.  This
              project develops, validates and  tests eight computer-based scenarios, based on
              Chem Com, in  which parameters can be carried to provide different  outcomes. 
              The scenarios assess student knowledge of  chemistry content, level of student
              understanding, and  ability to make science-based decisions on societal issues.
                Resources are available to students to address the chemical  issues raised in
              the scenario.  Help can be given  electronically.  The student outcome can be
              electronically  scored in relation to the reasoning described and the help 
              given.  The assessments can be used to inform instruction  and also to provide
              objective, bias-free measures useful in  high stakes testing.  The
              computer-based objective  assessment tasks (Com-BOATS) are designed by project 
              personnel with experience in developing examinations at the  American Chemical
              Society (ACS) Examinations Institute using  Authorware Pro shells.  The tasks
              are pilot and field tested  nationally in classrooms.  The results are
              interpreted by  third party evaluators.  Dissemination is through the ACS.
