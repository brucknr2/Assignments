Abstract    :
              Computer algebra software represents a mature, interactive                     
              technology that is only just beginning to reach the physics                    
              classroom. Its successful integration into the curriculum                      
              depends on the careful attention to the capabilities and limits                
              of this software. Such attention can only come from a thorough                 
              mastery of the programs. This workshop provides the                            
              participants an opportunity to master a computer algebra                       
              program and develop strategies for its use in broadening the                   
              range of physics topics available in the physics classroom.                    
              Workshop participants are then able to lead workshops of their                 
              own in local and regional settings.
