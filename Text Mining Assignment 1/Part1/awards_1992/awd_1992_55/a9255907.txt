              Northeastern University will initiate a six-week, commuter,                    
              Young Scholars project in engineering for 24 students                          
              entering the 11th and 12th grades.                                             
                                                                                             
              This summer program places each participant in an                              
              engineering research laboratory for 18-20 hours per week in                    
              addition to providing instruction in PASCAL.  Field trips to                   
              industrial engineering locations are provided.  Each                           
              participant is receives mentoring from two research                            
              scientists.   During the following academic year students                      
              remain in contact with peers and scientists through an                         
              electronic network.
