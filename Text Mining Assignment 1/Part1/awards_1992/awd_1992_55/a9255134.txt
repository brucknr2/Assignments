              The Marquette University Equal Opportunity Program (EOP), together             
              with the College of Engineering, offers a 4-week Summer Science                
              Camp Program that provides enrichment experiences in science,                  
              engineering and mathematics 59 48 middle school minority students,             
              plus academic year activities at Marquette and in three area middle

              World of Robotics" through hands-on discovery and demonstration                
              activities in civil, mechanical, electrical and computer                       
              engineering; and 2) construction of a LEGO/TC robot to accomplish
