Abstract    :
              The capabilities of inexpensive computer systems have greatly                  
              increased theimportance of computer graphics and its                           
              applications, such as visualization and multimedia. This                       
              project will support two undergraduate faculty workshops on                    
              Computer Graphics focusing on advanced techniques for image                    
              synthesis with the objectives of helping faculty to upgrade                    
              their current computer graphics courses and producing                          
              curriculum materials which they can use in their own                           
              courses.***//
