Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This project proposes to create an interactive computer                        
              program and database titled Datascope that will be a                           
              storehouse of environmental information.  The most                             
              comprehensive data now available on natural resource and                       
              environmental issues in 146 countries of the world will be                     
              used as a source of information for this program.  Students                    
              will be able to manipulate this database, add their own data                   
              and seek solutions to environmental problems with the aid of                   
              developed support materials and an education software                          
              program.  The project is well designed and would make a                        
              valuable environmental database available in an interactive                    
              format that students could use in solving real problems.                       
              Students could gain experience in data manipulation,                           
              mapping, analysis, data use and understanding.  Portions of                    
              the program could be used in the social sciences equally                       
              well.  Methods have been outlined where WRI will work with                     
              TERC and the Canadian Space Agency to develop a student and                    
              teacher guide to data analysis and interpretation.
