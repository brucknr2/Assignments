Abstract    :
              This project helps introductory physics teachers develop the                   
              instructional, computing and laboratory interfacing skills                     
              needed to help their students learn physics by using the                       
              computer in the exploration of real-world phenomena.  A two-                   
              week seminar is being offered in June 1993 and 1994 with 30                    
              participants invited each summer.                                              
                                                                                             
              Topics covered will include: interactive instructional                         
              strategies based on outcomes of educational research; computer                 
              interfacing; use of spreadsheets and graphing packages; data                   
              and error analysis techniques; the application of laboratory                   
              interfacing real-time data analysis to lecture demonstrations;                 
              and numerical problem solving and modeling.
