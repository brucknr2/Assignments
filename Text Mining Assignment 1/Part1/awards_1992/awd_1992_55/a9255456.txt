Abstract    :
              Workshops to enhance Quantitative Instruction on American                      
              Society (QIAS) will bring together 40 social scientists                        
              teaching at the undergraduate level.  The workshops will                       
              involve two sequential sessions in each of two years.                          
              During the initial five-day June workshop participants will                    
              use microcomputers to work actively with data exploration                      
              software and large scale data bases doing exercises which                      
              foster scientific thinking, analytic skills and an inquiry-                    
              based approach to social science teaching and learning.                        
              Participants use their own data along with data from the                       
              General Social Survey and the National Election Study to                       
              develop material for their own courses. Following this workshop                
              faculty participants will return to their home campuses and                    
              experiment with altering curriculum to include quantitative                    
              instruction.  The following January they will reassemble at a                  
              three-day follow-up workshop and demonstrate their materials                   
              for their workshop colleagues.                                                 
              Throughout the program networking will be encouraged and                       
              instructional applications shared through a newsletter.
