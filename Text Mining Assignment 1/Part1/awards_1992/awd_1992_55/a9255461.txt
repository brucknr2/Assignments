Abstract    :
              This proposal is for two one-week workshops for 20 social                      
              scientists, each covering techniques of exploratory data analysis              
              using a statistical package particularly suited for graphical data             
              analysis, Stata.  Participants will develop skills in using and                
              teaching robust statistics, analytical graphics, and data                      
              transformations. Exploratory data analytic techniques, such as data            
              smoothing, median polishing, re-scaling, and transforming data                 
              using the ladder of powers, five number summaries, box and whisker             
              plots, and stem and leaf charts, will be emphasized.                           
              The workshop will also illustrate pedagogical methods for teaching             
              EDA techniques at the undergraduate level.                                     
              The significance of the project to undergraduate faculty and                   
              students lies in the use of exploratory data analysis techniques as            
              interesting and useful alternatives to traditional confirmatory                
              statistics.                                                                    
              Faculty who have training through the level of multiple regression             
              will be accepted for one week, while a two-day longer workshop will            
              accept faculty whose training is up to the multiple regression                 
              level. In both cases, faculty will have responsibility for the                 
              required methodological courses in their disciplines.
