Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              PRIME Science provides an American adaptation of "Salter's                     
              Science"--a well-tested British multi-disciplinary science                     
              program for middle grades.  The science is balanced - not                      
              integrated - between life, earth and physical science,                         
              developing conceptual understanding and integrating                            
              mathematics, technology and decision-making.   The science                     
              is rigorous, interesting and useful to the student.  Among                     
              the major integrative themes that provide structure                            
              for grades six through ten are the earth in space,                             
              properties of matter, etc.  Each unit begins with an                           
              application.  The teachers' guides are directed at first                       
              year teachers,  not teaching in their major discipline.                        
              Included are student preconceptions, safety, background,                       
              ways of introducing the content and assessment items.                          
              The visually-stimulating, attractively-designed student                        
              supplements for each of the forty units contain the                            
              application, a summary of what students should know, what                      
              they need to learn and the activities the can do.  The                         
              materials are tested and rewritten by teachers and science                     
              educators at several sites throughout the US. Professors at                    
              the University of California/Berkeley review the materials                     
              for content accuracy.  The British developers are part of                      
              the design team.  The adaptation involves not only language                    
              translation, but changing data to interest American                            
              audiences and adding units to meet local interests and                         
              frameworks.
