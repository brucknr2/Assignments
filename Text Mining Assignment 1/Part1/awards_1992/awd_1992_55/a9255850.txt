Abstract    :
              The recent focus in the mathematical community on calculus and                 
              the development of the NCTM Standards for K-12 teachers is                     
              providing a framework to consider mathematics courses taught at                
              two-year colleges and lower division mathematics courses taught                
              at other institutions of higher education in this country.                     
              These courses are important elements in continuum and pipeline                 
              issues, as well as general mathematical needs of students not                  
              continuing in mathematically oriented fields of studies. The                   
              American Mathematical Association of Two-Year Colleges (AMATYC)                
              is undertaking a leadership role in designing a framework for                  
              systemic reform of college mathematics in the curriculum                       
              leading to calculus. The first stage is a meeting of an AMATYC                 
              National Steering Committee consisting of leaders of AMATYC,                   
              MAA, and NCTM as well as others actively involved in the                       
              development of innovative mathematics curricula and Standards                  
              . In the second stage a small invited conference of a National                 
              Task Force is being held to establish guidelines for the                       
              development of a set of Standards for two-year college and                     
              lower division mathematics and to formulate a plan to build                    
              consensus for mathematics reform among two-year college and                    
              university constituencies.
