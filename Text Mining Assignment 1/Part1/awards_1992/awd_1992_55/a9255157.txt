Abstract    :
              Meharry Medical college proposes the continuation of its                       
              Research Centers of Excellence in Cell and Molecular                           
              Biology.  The overall goal of the Center is to continue                        
              a strong research effort in membrane biology as a                              
              vehicle through minority junior high, high school, and                         
              college students can develop strong interest in a                              
              science career.  In addition the center will continue to                       
              develop strategies to strengthen partnerships with                             
              industry and academic.  Research results have shown an                         
              explosion of knowledge which elucidates the molecular                          
              mechanisms and structures that are responsible for                             
              complex processes such as cell growth and division,                            
              metabolism, differentiations, and development.  More                           
              significantly, the new methods that have developed                             
              concurrently with this knowledge provide a way to                              
              manipulate molecules and observe biochemical changes in                        
              living systems.                                                                
                                                                                             
              The project meets the major goal of the Minority                               
              Research Centers of Excellence (MRCE) program: to                              
              increase the minority presence in science and                                  
              engineering by making substantial resources available to                       
              upgrade the research capabilities of strong and                                
              productive minority institutions.  This project will                           
              allow the institution to continue to use research as a                         
              tool to increase the effectiveness of related science                          
              and engineering activities for minority group in its                           
              region.  In addition, the project will provide                                 
              opportunities for minority faculty and students at                             
              Meharry and nearby institutions to engage in meritorious                       
              research that leads to publications in refereed                                
              journals.
