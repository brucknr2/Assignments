Abstract    :
              The MAA's Interactive Mathematics Text Project will run 12 six-                
              day workshops on interactive texts during the summer of 1993.                  
              These workshops have as their goal the improvement of                          
              mathematics learning by disseminating information on the use of                
              interactive texts in collegiate mathematics instruction and by                 
              supporting the development of such texts. The workshops will                   
              provide hands-on training on the use of authoring software                     
              (e.g., Mathematica, Mathcad, or Maple), examination of sample                  
              texts, opportunity to create an interactive text on a specific                 
              topic, and follow-up networking activities.
