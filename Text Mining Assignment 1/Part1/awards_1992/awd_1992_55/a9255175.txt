              "Middle School Mathematics and Science at California State                     
              University San Marcos" ((MS)2(SM)) is a  summer camp                           
              initiative sponsored by California State University san                        
              Marcos in collaboration with the public school districts of                    
              Escondido, Oceanside, San Marcos, and Vista.  This                             
              academically based enrichment program offers mathematics and                   
              science related activities to develop and sustain the                          
              interest of seventh through ninth grade African-American,                      
              Hispanic, Native-American, and Pan-Asian students in north                     
              San Diego County.  Each summer the students attend a four-                     
              week institute taught by local science and mathematics                         
              teachers and college or university scientists and                              
              mathematicians.  Students use calculators and computers as                     
              they develop the critical thinking and problem-solving                         
              skills that form the basis for scientific work.  During the                    
              summer and academic year, participants take field trips to                     
              interact with scientists in a variety of work settings and                     
              are mentored by local college students and academic or                         
              industrial scientists.  Project results will be disseminated                   
              through professional education networks, submission of                         
              articles to refereed journals, and presentations at local,                     
              state and national meetings.
