Abstract    :
              Advanced separation processes are critical to many of the                      
              traditional and emerging engineering fields. Therefore, it is                  
              important that undergraduate faculty be educated in this                       
              growingfield of separation science and technology in order to                  
              integrate itinto the engineering curriculum. Advancedseparation                
              processes are being incorporated into                                          
              biologicalengineering/biotechnology;hazardous waste management;                
              specialty chemical and biochemicalproduction; food and beverage                
              processing; biomedical engineering;and in the traditional                      
              chemical, petroleum, and energy industries.Two workshops are                   
              planned for Summer 1993 and 1994. The workshops will combine                   
              both lecture and laboratory components of advanced separation                  
              technology, thus providing participants with hands-on                          
              experience.  Workshop participants will have lectures on the                   
              importance, process development, and applications of advanced                  
              separation processes.
