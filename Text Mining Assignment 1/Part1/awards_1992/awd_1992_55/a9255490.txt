Abstract    :
              The workshop is for college instructors who teach upper-                       
              division experimental physics courses or who may be considering                
              the development of such a course. The program facilitates the                  
              exchange of ideas about advanced physics experiments. There is                 
              be ample opportunity to discuss and perform the CSUH upper-                    
              division laboratory experiments. Equipment lists, data, and                    
              helpful hints are provided to assist in the development of                     
              similar experiments at the participants' home institutions.
