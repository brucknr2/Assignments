Abstract    :
              During the first summer workshop, faculty will develop                         
              laboratory activities, they will class-test these activities                   
              during the academic year, and evaluate and refine them during                  
              a second summer workshop.  The workshop will include                           
              instruction in multiprocessing, in addition to methodologies                   
              for laboratory exercise development.
