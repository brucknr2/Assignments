Abstract    :
              Twenty one Laboratory Directors representing the Nation's                      
              institutions that enroll large numbers of students in                          
              introductory chemistry courses intended for science and                        
              engineering majors are meeting for a three day conference to                   
              address the challenges associated with providing a modern                      
              general chemistry laboratory experience for upwards of 1000                    
              students per term.                                                             
                                                                                             
                   The objectives of the conference are:                                     
                                                                                             
                  (1) to outline several laboratory curricula based on                       
              materials, reactitivy, and environmental issues and develop                    
              detailed plans for implementing them in large, multi-section                   
              courses.                                                                       
                                                                                             
                  (2) to address management issues and delivery systems.                     
                                                                                             
                  (3) to consider the responsibilities and role of teaching                  
              assistants in implementing the new curricula, and problems                     
              associated with language, cultural differences, and attitudes                  
              toward education arising from the international background of                  
              the teaching assistants.                                                       
                                                                                             
                   (4) to explore the possibilities for microscale                           
              quantitative determinations and the relative balance between                   
              the use of instruments and learning basic techniques.
