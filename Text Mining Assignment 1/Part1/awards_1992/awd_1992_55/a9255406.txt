Abstract    :
              The workshop will focus on procedures for collection and analysis              
              of geologic data required to evaluate subsurface conditions for                
              environmental studies.  The unique criteria for and limitation of              
              groundwater monitoring, soil sampling, and development of sampling             
              plans to meet regulatory criteria will be stressed.   With its                 
              emphasis on practical considerations, the workshop will provide                
              geology faculty with the necessary background in environmental                 
              science to introduce their students to the current practices in                
              this area.
