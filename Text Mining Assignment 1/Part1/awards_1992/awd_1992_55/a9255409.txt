Abstract    :
              The project involves two (Summer 1993, 1994), two-week summer                  
              workshops that will provide undergraduate educators with an in-                
              depth exposure to modern theories and experimental techniques of               
              polymer science and engineering. The major goals are to provide                
              background information and experience to stimulate incorporation of            
              these topics into undergraduate curricula.  The program emphasizes             
              lectures on the prominent theories and experimental approaches by              
              renowned scientists and engineers and provides participants with               
              hands-on experience in several polymer science laboratories                    
              carrying out synthetic procedures, measuring solution and solid                
              state properties and examining surface and bulk structures.
