Abstract    :
              Enhancement of Science/Mathematics Faculty Through Modeling: A                 
              Path Toward Critical Thinking                                                  
              A coalition of six two-year and one four-year colleges in                      
              southeastern Kansas has designed an eighteen-month                             
              multidisciplinary project for faculty enhancement. In each of                  
              two summers there will be several week-long workshops designed                 
              to: (1) enhance content knowledge, (2) enhance critical                        
              thinking skills through the use of modeling, and (3) develop                   
              instructional strategies to promote effective teaching.                        
              Content areas include: modeling theory, molecular modeling,                    
              modeling in environmental science, recombinant DNA, revised                    
              college algebra, chromosome mapping, Maple V, chaos and fractal                
              geometry, and classroom assessment.                                            
              Participants will develop and adopt curricular materials and                   
              assessment skills appropriate for their institutions. Academic                 
              year activities will provide continuity and participant                        
              support.***
