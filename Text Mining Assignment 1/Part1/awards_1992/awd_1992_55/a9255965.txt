Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The Minnesota Zoological Garden seeks to initiate an eleven-                   
              week commuter Young Scholars project in behavioral research                    
              and conservation biology for ten students entering grades                      
              eleven and twelve. The project provides opportunities for                      
              students to engage in seminars, field trips, research                          
              methodology, and classroom activities focusing on animal                       
              behavior, conservation biology, and zoo biology. Each                          
              student develops and executes an independent research study                    
              with guidance from program professional staff and individual                   
              zoo staff mentors. The seminars and field trips are designed                   
              to increase the students' awareness of educational and                         
              career opportunities in related scientific fields.
