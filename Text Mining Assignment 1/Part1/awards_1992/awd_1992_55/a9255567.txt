Abstract    :
              This project uses a five-day short course to present faculty                   
              members with an integrated methodology for teaching                            
              undergraduate control theory applicable to a wide range of                     
              mechanical, electrical, thermal, and fluid systems. The program                
              combines the insight and understanding of classical control                    
              (frequency domain) theory with the computational power of                      
              modern control (time domain) theory. Often, the tools of these                 
              two domains are taught in separate sections of a course, or in                 
              separate courses. This need not be the case. Frequency domain                  
              analysis provides excellent insight into system stability,                     
              performance and robustness. Time domain methods are best suited                
              for computer applications. Having exposure to both time and                    
              frequency domains, students may learn how to freely move                       
              between them.  Such a capability provides students with both an                
              excellent intuitive understanding of control theory, as well as                
              the ability to exploit computational tools.  Participants will                 
              leave the course with a powerful set of resources (bound                       
              lecture notes, software, syllabi, and worked problems) that are                
              easy to use.  Contact will be maintained with participants                     
              after the conclusion of the short course; a meeting of the                     
              participants will be organized at a technical conference to                    
              share lessons learned and to evaluate the effectiveness of                     
              integrating the short course concepts into their curricula.
