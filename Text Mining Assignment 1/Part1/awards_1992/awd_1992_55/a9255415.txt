Abstract    :
              The Center for Applied Aquatic Science and Aquaculture is                      
              conducting a three-week summer project for undergraduate faculty               
              that demonstrates environmental problem-solving as an effective                
              teaching strategy to stimulate undergraduates' interest in                     
              environmental science.  Using the theme of Stressed Stream Analysis            
              participating faculty will study NEPA-based environmental analysis             
              concepts and techniques and work in teams to prepare an                        
              Environmental Impact Statement for a proposed pollution source in              
              a disturbed stream ecosystem. Concepts and skills participants will            
              explore include: habitat evaluation procedures, using biotic                   
              indices, electrophoretic and microscope techniques to evaluate                 
              pollutant effects on organisms, and water quality analysis of                  
              nutrients and metals in a stressed stream ecosystem.
