Abstract    :
              The Maryland Undergraduate Mathematics Enhancement Program                     
              (MUMEP) supports a regional coalition of mathematics faculty                   
              from two- and four-year Maryland institutions in the region                    
              near the University of Maryland, College Park campus. Through                  
              workshops and seminars, MUMEP fosters communication among                      
              regional mathematics departments. A week-long workshop is                      
              offered during each of the summers of 1993 and 1994, devoted to                
              visual thinking in mathematics.  Mathematics topics are chosen                 
              from chaotic dynamics and fractal geometry. Workshop                           
              participants will gain hands-on experience working individually                
              and in small groups. During each academic year following the                   
              respective summer workshop, regional seminars are held in which                
              participants continue the mathematical and curricular dialogue                 
              begun during the workshops.
