Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The T2Me project will study teachers' capabilities for creating and            
              using meaniningful assessment instruments in mathematics.  This                
              project will bring together mathematicsteachers, assessment                    
              experts, mathematicians, and educators in a collaborative effort to            
              improve assessment in mathematics.  Eight teams of elementary and              
              middle school teachers, with prior experience in integrating                   
              technology into the math curriculum, will receive extensive                    
              training in developing assessment procedures that emphasize higher-            
              order thinking processes.  The teams will learn how to develop                 
              dynamic assessment materials; create assessment materials that                 
              incorporate innovative instructional technology; and field-test and            
              evaluate the developed materials in their classrooms.  Evidence of             
              teachers' capabilities and accomplishments will be collected                   
              through interviews, observations, and analysis of field-notes.                 
              Case studies will be developed to characterize teachers' efforts.
