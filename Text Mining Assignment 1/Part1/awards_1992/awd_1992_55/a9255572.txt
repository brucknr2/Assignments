Abstract    :
              Microscale techniques can be applied to such important areas as                
              organometallic chemistry and bioinorganic synthesis. This                      
              offers many advantages to the traditional offerings in these                   
              fields, most notably reductions in the quantities of chemicals                 
              used, safety hazards, time required to perform an experiment,                  
              and amount of waste produced.  Air quality is sharply improved.                
              The workshops on microscale offer an opportunity in the ongoing                
              effort at the revitalization of the critical field of inorganic                
              chemistry laboratory at the undergraduate level.
