Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The University of Maine will initiate a three-week,                            
              residential, Young Scholars project in engineering for 24                      
              students entering the 11th and 12th grades.                                    
                                                                                             
              This summer program will emphasize the study of logic                          
              systems related to the design and analysis of digital                          
              circuits.  Students will complete engineering research                         
              projects, tour industrial sites, receive an overview of                        
              career opportunities in five engineering disciplines, and                      
              learn about ethics in an engineering setting.
