Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Purdue University seeks to provide a Young Scholars Program                    
              in agricultural and environmental sciences. The seven week                     
              summer residential program will be held on the West                            
              Lafayette Campus of Purdue University. The program will                        
              consist of 20 high school students who have completed their                    
              junior year from Indiana and the four contiguous states of                     
              Michigan, Ohio, Kentucky, and Illinois. The program will                       
              provide students an opportunity to broaden their                               
              appreciation of the scientific challenges offered by                           
              agriculture and natural resources disciplines through a                        
              combination of classroom lectures, informal structured                         
              discussions, and directed student research projects and                        
              hands-on laboratory activities supplemented by field trips.
