              The Summer Science Camps at Alabama A & M University provide                   
              African-American students entering grades 7-9 with innovative                  
              activities designed to provide:  1) a foundation for influencing their         
              interest in science and mathematics; 2) positive attitudes toward              
              staying in school and continuing the study of science and                      
              mathematics; 3) and encouragement to consider science, engineering             
              and mathematics disciplines as possible career choices.  The SSC               
              activities include a combination of enrichment instruction and                 
              laboratory experiences in science and mathematics, problem solving             
              experiences, experiences in developing strong study and                        
              communications skills, exposure to research methodology,experiences            
              designed to improve self-esteem and motivation, and career                     
              exploration emphasizing student interactions with scientists, engineers        
              and mathematicians.
