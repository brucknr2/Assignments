Abstract    :
              The purpose of this program is to gather information about the climate         
              for women in physics departments across the country and to feed this           
              information back to these departments, accompanied by suggestions              
              outlining how each department can assess its own climate and then act          
              to improve it.  General information about climate issues will be               
              obtained by producing, distributing, and analyzing questionnaires for          
              undergraduate and graduate students.  These will seek to identify the          
              special problems and concerns of women students.  More specific                
              information about climate issues will be obtained by visits by four or         
              five physics faculty, predominantly women, to 10 physics departments           
              offering both graduate and undergraduate physics programs.  Each visit         
              will be by invitation by the department and the university.  A written         
              report by the visiting team to the physics department will follow each         
              visit.  Six months after the visit, the department will be requested           
              to provide feedback on changes that have resulted from the visit.  At          
              the end of the grant period, the results of the national questionnaire         
              and a summary report of the 10 visits will be available to the physics         
              community.  The principal investigators will also prepare a report on          
              the project that will be distributed widely.
