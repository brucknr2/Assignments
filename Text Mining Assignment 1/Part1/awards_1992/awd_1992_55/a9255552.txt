Abstract    :
              The UNCA Workstation Workshop is a two-week introduction to the                
              use of workstations in science, engineering, and mathematics                   
              education and is designed for faculty in smaller departments                   
              who must provide much of their own computer support. Topics                    
              include networks, scientific problem-solving, plus network and                 
              graphics programming techniques. Sessions on system management                 
              and mining the network provide useful expertise. The workshop                  
              ends with a tutorial on Installation: From shipping cartons to
