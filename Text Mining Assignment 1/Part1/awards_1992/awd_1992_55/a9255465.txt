Abstract    :
              Eastern Maine Technical College will conduct three five-day                    
              training conferences on Metallurgy for 18 engineering                          
              technology faculty from 6 technical colleges throughout the                    
              state of Maine.  One conference will be held each year for                     
              three years.  Each Conference will include lectures,                           
              participation in laboratory testing procedures, and evaluation,                
              as well as discussions among participants about the integration                
              of these topics into their classes.  The first conference will                 
              focus on iron and steel; the second conference will emphasize                  
              aluminum and stainless, and the third conference will be                       
              devoted to titanium and exotic non-ferous metals.  Each                        
              conference will result in the development of a laboratory                      
              manual.  After each conference a mini-conference will be held                  
              to assess the integration of the conference curricula into the                 
              institutional curricula of the faculty participants.
