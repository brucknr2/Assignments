Abstract    :
              The Geometry of Multivariable Calculus strengthens the                         
              multidimensional geometric intuition that students need, but                   
              usually lack, to understand multivariable calculus.  To this                   
              end, community college and university instructors participating                
              in  week-long workshops are designing geometric worksheets                     
              ready for use in existing courses ranging from elementary to                   
              advanced multivariable calculus to linear algebra.  Workshops                  
              are taking place in Seattle and Spokane, with subsequent                       
              follow-up activities during the academic year.  Introduced at                  
              the level of undergraduate courses, topics include splines in                  
              1993 and differentials in 1994, with applications to aircraft                  
              design, computers, geographic maps, industrial engineering,                    
              orbital mechanics, and typography.  Applications come from                     
              advance mailings, guest lecturers, and demonstrations of                       
              computational geometry from the Applied Geometry Corporation                   
              and the Boeing Company.
