Abstract    :
              This three-week course offers 40 instructors of undergraduate                  
              marine sciences and related physical and biological science                    
              disciplines first hand exposure to California coastal marine                   
              environmenta.  Participants will collect and analyze                           
              oceanographic data aboard the R/V Gordon Sproul, conduct field                 
              exercises in modern day mid-lattitude marine habitats and an                   
              active continental margin tectonic terrain; develop laboratory                 
              exercises using satellite imaging; interact with local experts                 
              in marine biology, fisheries management, geology, and physical                 
              oceanography; and participate in a choice of special topic
