              The Research Careers for Minority Scholars (RCMS) program is                   
              designed to complement SUNY/College at Old Westbury's college life             
              science oriented programs, Minority Biomedical Research Support                
              (MBRS), Minority Access to Research Careers (MARC) and Minority                
              Institute of Research Development Programs (MIRDP), by providing               
              comprehensive research and academic enrichment opportunities                   
              directed towards physical science, mathematics and engineering                 
              (SEM) fields.  The College at Old Westbury is particularly suited              
              for this RCMS program because it has one of the highest percentages            
              of minority students in al the SUNY institutions, and has emerged              
              as a first-rate institution for undergraduate research in the                  
              biomedical sciences.  Through its Science Training and Education               
              Program, and educational pipeline from secondary school to college             
              has been established.                                                          
                                                                                             
              This three year proposal will provide thirty five student with (1)             
              a residential summer program for talented entering freshman to gain            
              and early debut into college (2) special academic and career                   
              faculty mentoring; (3) summer internship in nearby industries such             
              as Grumman Aerospace, H2M laboratories and Knogo Corporation; and              
              (4) pre-internship training program preparing students for this                
              industrial experience; (5) research opportunities with faculty                 
              mentors in chemistry, applied mathematics and computer science.                
                                                                                             
              By concentrating on NSF-supported areas of SEM, the RCMS Program               
              will complete the science education for minority students at the               
              college.
