Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Florida A&M University in collaboration with Albany State College,             
              Bethune-Cookman College, Clark-Atlanta University, Florida State               
              University, Florida International University, the University of                
              Florida, the University of South Florida, the University of Central            
              Florida and three affiliated community colleges (Daytona Beach,                
              Miami-Dade and Tallahassee) has formulated a program designed to               
              influence more minorities to select careers in science, engineering            
              and mathematics.  The Alliance will emphasize a focused effort to              
              increase directly the recruitment, retention, graduation and                   
              graduate school placement of Blacks, Hispanics, and Native                     
              Americans who are enrolled in the undergraduate SEM degree programs            
              at Albany State and Bethune-Cookman Colleges, Florida A&M and                  
              Florida International Universities.  Indirectly, enhancement                   
              elements of the project will influence the persistence of                      
              minorities at the other alliance member institutions (Florida State            
              University, University of Central Florida, University of South                 
              Florida, University of Florida, and Clark-Atlanta University).  The            
              success of this project will be shared with other state and                    
              regional institutions.  This project, by applying a holistic                   
              approach to students' preparation, will emphasize multiple                     
              components that will positively impact their qualifications for                
              graduate school admission.  The Alliance's influence will span from            
              the pre-freshman level to the enrollment of scholars in SEM                    
              graduate programs.  Participants will be selected from biology,                
              chemistry, mathematics, physics and all engineering disciplines.
