Abstract    :
              Systemic Teacher Excellence Preparation, STEP, project                         
              The STEP project is designed to bring about large scale                        
              improvement in the preparation of science and mathematics                      
              teachers in Montana and to serve as a national model for rural                 
              areas with significant minority populations.  STEP is                          
              developing new alliances that form a statewide, interactive                    
              network consisting of school systems, Tribal Community Colleges                
              (TCC's), state Universities and Colleges, the State Office of                  
              Public Instruction, the Montana Council of Teachers of                         
              Mathematics, the Montana Science Teachers Association, the                     
              Montana University System and a number of related on-going NSF                 
              supported projects in the state: the Systemic Initiative for                   
              Montana Mathematics and Science (SIMMS), Six Through Eight                     
              Mathematics (STEM), and the Alliance of States Supporting                      
              Indians in Science and Technology (ASSIST).  The project is                    
              providing the following: at least 2 years of early career                      
              support for mathematics and science teachers in a rural                        
              setting; model teacher preparation field sites in K-12 schools;                
              increased numbers and better preparation of mathematics and                    
              science teachers from Native American Communities; a                           
              telecommunications network based model for fostering teacher                   
              preparation in rural states; strong faculty teams to redesign                  
              curricula and courses; strong institutional support for                        
              participating faculty and teachers; dissemination of new ideas                 
              in preparing teachers; an increase in the number of women and                  
              minority teachers in mathematics and science; and use of field                 
              sites as "living laboratories" for research on effective                       
              mathematics and science teaching, pre-service teacher                          
              supervision and the training of university science and                         
              mathematics educators in rural settings.
