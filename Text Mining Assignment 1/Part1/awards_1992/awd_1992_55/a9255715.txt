Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This project will develop materials that are used with                         
              existing CAD software, developed by Microcompatibles under                     
              an NSF SBIR grant.  These materials will be used in                            
              technology classes and, later, in math classes.  The                           
              software creates a block on the screen which, through the                      
              use of easy to learn commands, can be cut and drilled to                       
              make a part.  The student sees the part being cut on the                       
              screen and can zoom in and measure different areas of the                      
              part.  Once the instructions for cutting have been                             
              completed, they can be sent by network or modum to a shop in                   
              which the part is actually made and sent to the student.                       
              This will help students learn 3-dimensional visualization                      
              and integrate technology and math curriculum.
