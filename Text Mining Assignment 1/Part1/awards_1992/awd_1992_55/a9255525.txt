Abstract    :
              The State University of New York College at Brockport, in                      
              cooperation with the U.S. Geological Survey, will hold a two-                  
              week workshop in July 1993, at the National Training Center in                 
              Denver, Colorado, for 25 selected undergraduate college                        
              instructors of introductory courses with hydrology and water                   
              resources content. The major purposes of the workshop are: (1)                 
              to bring participants up-to-date on the science of hydrology                   
              and those technologies used to measure, analyze, and calculate                 
              hydrologic flows, surface and groundwater resources, and                       
              pollutant loadings and consequences; and (2) to equip and                      
              encourage these teachers to use the latest in water resources                  
              information and instructional materials in their classrooms.                   
              Educational materials developed by workshop participants will                  
              be presented at the Twenty-Ninth Annual American Water                         
              Resources Association Conference in the Fall of 1993.
