Abstract    :
              Laboratory-Based Instruction in Molecular and Human Genetics                   
              for Teaching Faculty                                                           
              Workshops introduce teaching faculty to basic molecular genetic                
              techniques and their applications to human genetics. Faculty                   
              from smaller institutions would be targeted to attend 10-day                   
              summer workshops and two-day winter follow-up sessions. Each                   
              summer, one workshop is held in a large metropolitan area                      
              convenient to large numbers of minority educators, while a                     
              second workshop is sited in a smaller urban area accessible to                 
              underserved faculty from the rural midwest and intermountain                   
              west.***//
