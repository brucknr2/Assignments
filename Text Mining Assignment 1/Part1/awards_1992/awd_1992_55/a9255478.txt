Abstract    :
              This workshop familiarizes engineering undergraduate faculty                   
              with the importance and recent developments in the design of                   
              new products through Concurrent Engineering (CE) and Design for                
              Manufacture (DFM).  Several tools and methods, including                       
              customer driven engineering, product rating for assembly based                 
              on geometry or assembly motions, reverse engineering, and the                  
              use of the process capability for setting the quality and                      
              tolerance limits for new parts are presented and discussed with                
              classroom and laboratory exercises.  The workshop is followed-                 
              up by a quarterly newsletter and the exchange of software and                  
              video tapes of classroom implementation.
