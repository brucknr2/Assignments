Abstract    :
              Most astronomy teachers at two-year and four-year colleges are                 
              not full-time astronomers and many do not hold doctoral                        
              degrees. However, these faculty annually enroll a large number                 
              of astronomy students.  The purpose of this project is to                      
              enhance the faculty effectiveness of a number of astronomy                     
              instructors at colleges by assisting them to begin their own                   
              observational astronomy research programs.  The entry-level                    
              type of research can be mastered by physics-trained faculty                    
              members.  The data-gathering required for the type of research                 
              can be undertaken by beginning-level undergraduates using the                  
              type of equipment found at small colleges. The project will                    
              enrich educational experiences for a large number of                           
              undergraduate students who would not normally have such an                     
              opportunity.                                                                   
              Two groups of 15 college astronomy teachers are coming to the                  
              Center for Astrophysics for a week-long workshop.  While at the                
              Center for Astrophysics, teachers will be taught the rudiments                 
              of photoelectric photometry, photoelectric and charged coupled                 
              device (CCD) observation of occulations.  The program will give                
              the participants the necessary theory and background knowledge                 
              to allow them to actually do astronomical research and will                    
              provide research opportunities for their students.
