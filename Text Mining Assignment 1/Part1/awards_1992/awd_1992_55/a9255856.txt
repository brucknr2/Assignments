Abstract    :
              The National Science Foundation is sponsoring its first National               
              Conference on Diversity in the Scientific Workforce, which is scheduled        
              in Washington, DC on September 24-27, 1992.  The conference will focus         
              attention on the Foundation's role in the education of minorities who          
              are underrepresented in science, engineering and mathematics (SEM)             
              fields.  Conference activities will include research presentations by          
              230 HRD project students.                                                      
                                                                                             
              Morgan State University proposes to coordinate student component               
              activities including arranging student travel and hotel accommodations         
              and scheduling networking activities among students and between                
              students and scientists.  The student component will complement the            
              planning and development of the NSF action plan by illustrating the            
              success of current NSF efforts in minority SEM education, thereby              
              forming a basis on which to build future strategies.  Morgan would be          
              assisted in these tasks by Career Communications Group, Inc., a                
              minority-owned firm that has extensive experience in planning student          
              career development activities.
