Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This planning grant will lead to a proposal from the                           
              University of Idaho to extend a successful model for science                   
              to mathematics education.  The Mathematics Assessment and                      
              Restructuring System (MARS) will design and validate an                        
              instrument to systematically work in individual schools to                     
              help improve K-12 mathematics education.  Using members of                     
              the Idaho Mathematics Coalition, the project will develop an                   
              assessment instrument appropriate to different schools                         
              across the state.  A process of development, planning                          
              meetings, and validation of the instrument will be used.                       
              The grant is for 6 months and includes 162% cost sharing.    //
