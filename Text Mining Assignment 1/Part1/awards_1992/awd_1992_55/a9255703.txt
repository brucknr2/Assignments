Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The Self Help Elementary Level Science (SHELLS) Part II is                     
              the continuation of the video project SHELLS I.  It is                         
              intended primarily for administrators, teachers, school                        
              volunteers and parents to learn how to minimize, circumvent                    
              or even eliminate some of the obstacles of doing science in                    
              elementary schools.  Since physical science is the most                        
              problematic content for adults and children alike eighty                       
              percent of series content deals in physical science                            
              concepts.  Part I consists of a set of seven half hour                         
              shows:  five programs on force and motion topics; one on                       
              instruction using physical science concepts and one show on                    
              administration topics related to implementing and                              
              maintaining a strong elementary science program.  In                           
              addition there is a 10-minute overview tape for Part I to                      
              serve orientation and dissemination functions.  The design                     
              goal is to make the shows sufficiently appealing and                           
              instructive to motivate adult viewers to become advocates                      
              for elementary science and to feel some satisfaction and joy                   
              in doing so.  This proposal for SHELLS Part II will provide                    
              print materials for the videos completed in Part I and an                      
              in-depth evaluation of the project.
