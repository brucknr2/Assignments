Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The Experimental Program to Stimulate Competitive Research                     
              (EPSCoR) in the State of West Virginia will enhance the research               
              competitiveness of investigators working in three research                     
              clusters:  (1) Cell Regulatory Biology; (2) Nonlinear Dynamics;                
              and (3) Computational Materials.  Three universities will                      
              participate:  Marshall University; West Virginia University and                
              West Virginia Institute of Technology.  The West Virginia plan                 
              offers knowledge transfer activities which will increase the                   
              number of graduate students for the biomedical Ph.D. program,                  
              establish a graduate research seminar for students to present                  
              their research results in non-linear dynamics, and establish                   
              workshops with industry representatives in computational                       
              materials research.  West Virginia will continue to fund an                    
              equipment grant program to inspire undergraduate students to                   
              continue science and engineering careers.  Active participants in              
              EPSCoR governance will include key university administrators,                  
              State government officers, and influential members of the private              
              sector.  Over the three-year award period the State of West                    
              Virginia will contribute $3.6 million to ensure the success of                 
              the EPSCoR effort.
