Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This proposal, from the Quality Education for Minorities                       
              Network, is designed to support a working conference whose                     
              agenda is the conceptualization of a national strategy to                      
              improve the education, especially the mathematics and science                  
              education, of children and youth living in low-income                          
              residential communities (LRCs).  Attendees, approximately 60                   
              working  participants and 25 observers, will include                           
              representatives of HBCUs and predominately minority                            
              institutions, school districts, professional organizations and                 
              human service agencies.  The conference is planned for 8/28-                   
              30, 1992.                                                                      
                                                                                             
              A national organization, the Housing Development Network, will                 
              be established as an outcome of the conference and will be                     
              hosted by QEM.  Its major purpose will be to promote linkages                  
              between universities, housing developments LRCs, community-                    
              based organizations, health and social service agencies, and                   
              local housing authorities. Attendees at a small follow-up                      
              conference  will write  the Conference Proceedings.                            
                                                                                             
              This project is an extremely cost-effective yet substantive                    
              way of addressing one of the Nation's largest problems and                     
              shows potential for reaching out to a large number of                          
              institutions, youth and teachers.  The influence it might                      
              exert is increased by its probable joint sponsorship of a                      
              number of federal agencies.                                                    
                                                                                             
              Non-NSF cost-sharing is approximately 23% of the amount                        
              requested from NSF.
