Abstract    :
              9223684  First  The objective of this project is to understand the evolution of 
              magnetism, from adatoms to clusters to thin films.  Emphasis is  placed on
              clusters and adatoms.  Of interest is the minimum size  required for
              cooperative magnetic properties.  Also of interst are  interparticle magnetic
              interactions.  The result will be relevant  to development of magnetic cluster
              media, magnetic thin-film  technology, and theories of low-dimensional
              magnetism.  Scanning  tunneling microscopy and spin-polarized scanning
              tunneling  microscopy will be used in the investigations.  %%%  This project
              will study magnetic interactions between magnetic  atoms on surfaces.  Groups
              of atoms will be built up to form  clusters, and the variation of the magnetic
              properties of the  cluster with size will be studied with atomically sensitive 
              microscopies.  The results will be relevant to the development of  new magnetic
              media for thin film recording and general information  technology.  ***
