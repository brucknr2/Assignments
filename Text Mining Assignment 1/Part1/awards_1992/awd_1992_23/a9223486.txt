Abstract    :
              This actions funds an interagency agreement with the Bureau of the             
              Census to conduct the 1993 NSCG (National Survey of College                    
              Graduates - formerly the "postcensal survey of scientists and                  
              engineers).  The NSCG collects data on education, training and                 
              employment related to science and engineering from a nationally                
              representative sample of persons with bachelor's degrees (or                   
              higher).  These data are used in the National Science Foundation's             
              Scientific and Technical Personnel Data System (STPDS).
