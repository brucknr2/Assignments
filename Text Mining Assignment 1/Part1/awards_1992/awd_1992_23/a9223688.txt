Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  This is a study of the effect of power differentials in                   
              exchanges, the influence of different social network structures,               
              and alternative strategies of interaction.  The first of two phases            
              will use computer simulations to extend Network Exchange Theory to             
              effects of different strategic approaches by actors.  A second part            
              of the research will use laboratory experiments on exchange between            
              human beings to explore these issues in social networks chosen to              
              permit comparative tests of competing theories.                                
                                                                                             
                   This study is important for two reasons.  First, it                       
              significantly extends existing research on power in social                     
              exchange, which has considerable application in several fields of              
              social science.  Second, it is an innovative combination of two                
              distinctive approaches, computer simulation and laboratory social              
              psychology.
