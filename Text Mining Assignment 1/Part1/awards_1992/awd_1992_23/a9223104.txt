Abstract    :
                   In each hemisphere at the core/mantle boundary, there are                 
              patches of magnetic flux with a polarity opposite to that of the               
              dominant flux for that hemisphere.  These patches account for most             
              of the secular variation of the geomagnetic field and may provide              
              an explanation for larger-scale, longer-term behavior.  In this                
              project, the behavior of the geomagnetic field will be modelled                
              using flux patches at the core/mantle boundary.  The interactions              
              of the flux patches will be treated as a problem in Ising model                
              theory.
