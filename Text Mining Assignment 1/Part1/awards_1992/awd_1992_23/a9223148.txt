Abstract    :
                   The rapid development of fiber-optic technology has made                  
              possible data transmission speeds of gigabits per second.  This                
              research explores routing algorithms for such high speed networks.             
              It is believed that the development of high speed networks will                
              proceed in two phases.  In phase one, the topology of current                  
              networks will remain the same, but the relatively low speed links              
              will be replaced with optical fiber links.  In phase two, new                  
              network architectures specifically suited for high speed links will            
              be developed.  This research will develop routing algorithms for               
              both phases.  In particular, optimization-based routing and network            
              reconfiguration algorithms are to be developed for phase one and               
              deflection routing for networks with regular structures for phase              
              two.
