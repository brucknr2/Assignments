Abstract    :
              The measurement of people's values for public or non-marketed                  
              goods - or for the loss of these goods - is playing an increasing              
              role in benefit-cost analysis for public policy decisions and                  
              regulations and in assessment of liability for environmental                   
              damage.  A widely used measure of these values, judgment of                    
              willingness to pay (WTP) for public goods, seems to be                         
              susceptible to a number of biases and irrelevant influences,                   
              particularly when it is elicited by a survey instrument.  An                   
              example is the embedding effect, in which the valuation of a good              
              such as disaster preparedness depends on whether the entire                    
              program containing that good (environmental services) has been                 
              evaluated first.  The research will conduct questionnaire studies              
              designed to isolate crucial features of WTP with particular                    
              attention to the role of moral norms.  Alternative elicitation                 
              methods, such as direct ratings of goods, will be explored, with               
              a view to understanding how unbiased evaluation might be                       
              achieved.  Other variables for investigation will include                      
              provision of context, type of choice rule, type of good                        
              (environmental or consumer), number of other people affected,                  
              fairness of the payment vehicle, and expectation of others'                    
              responses.
