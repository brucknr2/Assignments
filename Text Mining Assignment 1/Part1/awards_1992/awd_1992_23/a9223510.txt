Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  Small-scale citizen action movements have become more                     
              common in the political arena in the last 20 years and most                    
              research on them has been done at a very broad level.  This                    
              project uses an ethnographic approach to observe first-hand                    
              the organization, level of citizen participation, and the                      
              history of one such group in Britain: women tenants of                         
              public sector housing developments (council estates).                          
              Through the use of consensus modeling and other                                
              sophisticated research methods, the researcher will                            
              determine what new knowledge activists learn about the                         
              social order through their participation in local-level                        
              political campaigns and the degree to which participants'                      
              values and attitudes are transformed.  This work will result                   
              in one of the few thorough studies of citizen action in                        
              Western Europe, and will contribute to the growing corpus of                   
              anthropological literature on contemporary social movements                    
              and on women's forms of political action.
