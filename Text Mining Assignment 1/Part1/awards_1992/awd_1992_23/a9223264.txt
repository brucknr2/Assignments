Abstract    :
              The proposed workshop (in mid-September 1992 in Fortaleza and                  
              Florianopolis, Brazil) will develop a major focus of the research              
              agenda for the Inter-American Institute for Global Change Research             
              (IAI) -- ENSO and interannual climate variability.  In particular, the         
              workshop will (1) identify issues related to the application of                
              forecasts of seasonal-to-interannual climate variability to the                
              decision-making process at national and regional levels and (2) define         
              methods through which such forecasts can most effectively be                   
              applied to these processes.  The workshop is expected to develop               
              recommendations for developing a systematic flow of global climate             
              forecasts to decision-makers at national and regional levels.  The             
              workshop is also expected to identify needs for education and                  
              training in this area and to prepare of recommendations for                    
              addressing these needs.  The workshop will focus on two specific               
              regions -- the drought-affected region of northeastern Brazil and the          
              tropical and sub-tropical regions of southeastern South America                
              which have been impacted by ENSO.
