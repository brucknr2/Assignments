Abstract    :
              Goel         During the last few years, GaAs technology has emerged  rapidly
              from basic research to device and circuit development.   It is crucial to know
              the expected propagation delays in an  integrated circuit before it is
              fabricated.  To meet this  objective, numerical models have been developed that
              address  crosstalk and propagation delays in the parallel and crossing  VLSI
              multilevel interconnections as well as for the transverse  delays in the GaAs
              MESFETs and GaAs/AIGaAs MODFETs.  In addition  to determining the crosstalk and
              propagation delays, the models  can be utilized to achieve the optimization of
              the device and  interconnection dimensions and other parameters for minimum 
              crosstalk and delays.  Validation of these numerical models by  comparison of
              the modeling results with actual experimental  observations is critical if they
              are to be incorporated into GaAs  CAD tools.  This research effort focuses on
              the following set of  objectives:  1.     design and fabrication of several
              GaAs-based logic circuits  to retain the ability to alter the various design
              parameters;  2.     application of the interconnection and the GaAs MESFET
              delay  models recently developed for the determination of propagation  delays
              in these GaAs-based logic circuits;  3.     experimental measurements of
              propagation delays in these  circuits and comparison with developed delay
              models;  4.     modification of the interconnection and transistor delay 
              models, as required; and  5.     experimental validation of the final models.
