Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              A line of cleavage divides social science thinking on "ethnicity,"             
              defined as the genetic and cultural features such as skin color,               
              language, religion, and homeland by which a person tends to anchor             
              his or her sense of self.  On the one hand are scholars who stress             
              the utility of ethnic identifications in achieving political goals             
              (the instrumentalists); on the other are those who view ethnicity              
              much more as an inherent part of individual identity (the                      
              primordialists).  The primordialist view would suggest that people             
              join ethnically based political parties largely for psychological              
              reasons while, for instrumentalists, the decision to join turns on             
              how efficiently the organization appears to pursue its economic or             
              political objectives.                                                          
                                                                                             
              Employing a mailed questionnaire, this doctoral dissertation                   
              research project tests hypotheses issuing from the theory of social            
              identity, a theory that promises to provide a superior grasp of                
              ethnicity's primordial aspect and its relationship to ethnically               
              based political participation in Germany, Britain and France.  If              
              the hypotheses are borne out, this research will offer empirical               
              evidence in favor of the primordialist perspective, suggesting that            
              instrumentalists might have to revise their accounts of the rise               
              and decline of ethnically based political parties and of ethnic                
              group behavior in general.  The research will indicate the value of            
              the theory of social identity for explaining why people join                   
              ethnically based political parties.
