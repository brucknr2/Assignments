Abstract    :
              The methods of computational chemistry are being expanded and                  
              improved in this study in the Theoretical and Computational                    
              Chemistry Program in the Division of Chemistry in order to                     
              permit their greater applicability to very large molecular                     
              systems including surfaces and other bulk forms of matter.  New                
              methods patterned after electron density functional theory are                 
              being developed.  Applications include the modeling of                         
              chemisorption of metal atoms to graphite surfaces, the                         
              interpretation of scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) images,                  
              and studies of the epitaxial growth of diamond.  The work also                 
              involves the large-area (global) networking of supercomputers.

              New mathematical and computational models are being developed                  
              to permit the calculation of the properties of very molecular                  
              systems including the bonding of metal atoms to graphite                       
              surfaces and the growth of diamond crystals.  An important                     
              aspect of this work is its use of large-area (global)                          
              networking of supercomputers.
