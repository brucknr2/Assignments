Abstract    :
              The impacts of climate change are possibilities that should be                 
              considered in decisions involving long-term commitments for                    
              resource planning and management.  Such decisions are now being                
              weighed by the International Joint Commission concerning resource              
              management of the Great Lakes basin.  This study develops a                    
              modeling system and decision framework to address the Great Lakes              
              decision problem.  The model will provide insights into the                    
              effects climate change may have on the basin and into the more                 
              general process of how this information is used and valued.  The               
              project addresses three issues: (1) the effective provision of                 
              climate change information for Great Lakes management decisions;               
              (2) the evaluation of management flexibility and the worth of                  
              better information given the uncertainties surrounding climate                 
              change; and (3) the evaluation of how better information affects               
              users and their understanding of resource management for the                   
              Great Lakes.
