Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The goals of the project is to assemble an ethno-historical                    
              picture of a region in northwestern Borneo that was for centuries              
              a small but integral part of the Asian world economy.  It is a                 
              region of remarkable ethnic complexity.  Moreover, communities                 
              are not fixed features of the social landscape, but have changed               
              constantly over the last century in response to internal and                   
              external trade, warfare, and colonial annexation.  This project                
              is designed to furnish the missing pieces of an ethnic puzzle                  
              which is of interest because it allows the researcher to take up               
              a new issue in an on-going study of the significance of ritual.                
              The complexity of communal interrelations over time is matched by              
              the great diversity of ritual within which similar notions of                  
              life and death are expressed.  Innovation in ritual is related                 
              not to deep meanings but to community dynamics.  Leaders can                   
              utilize to their own political ends, but they can not control its              
              diversity, which is shaped by larger historical forces.  By                    
              relating ritual diversity to community dynamics, this project                  
              sheds fresh light on the relationship between ritual and                       
              politics.
