Abstract    :
              9223725  Maling      This project explores the hypothesis that the syntactic
              cases form  a Case Tier which is mapped onto a hierarchy or grammatical 
              functions, consisting roughly of SUBJECT > OBJECT > ADVERB.  This  approach
              contrasts clearly with much current work on Case Theory,  which assumes that
              Nominative and Accusative are "structural" cases  (or Cases) assigned to
              particular configurational positions.  The  widespread occurrence of
              VP-internal nominatives and/or "nominative  objects" constitutes a serious
              problem for structural theories of  case assignment, but is entirely expected
              under the Case Tier  model.    The project will explore the limits of
              cross-linguistic variation  within the Case Tier model, focusing on the
              assignment of  nominative or absolutive case to verbal complements and various 
              kinds of adverbial adjuncts, and the casemarking of ditransitive  verbs.  Basic
              questions to be addressed include:         - What are the formal principles
              controlling the mapping, and         parameters that allow for variation?      
                - Is there a basic distinction between arguments and adjuncts?          What
              kinds of adverbials may participate in the hierarchy?         - How does
              syntactic case interact with oblique case assigned         structurally to
              particular configuration positions?         - How do predicate nominals get
              case-marked?         - How do expletives get case-marked?         - What are
              the implications of this approach for GB Case              Theory, particularly
              the Case Filter and Burzio's                  Generalization?  When are passive
              verbs accusative case             assigners?    Data will be drawn from a wide
              variety of case systems, including  Finnish, Greek, Icelandic, Korean, Quechua
              and various Australian,  Philippine, Slavic and South Asian languages.    ***
