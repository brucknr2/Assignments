Abstract    :
              The purpose of this research is to analyze the effect of insecure              
              ownership or property rights on the use of natural resources in                
              the developing world.  One cause of ownership insecurity is                    
              volatile political and legal regimes.  Several empirical studies               
              will be undertaken to explore the relationships between measures               
              of political volatility and natural resource development and                   
              extraction.  Models are developed to identify the effect of                    
              insecure ownership on incentives to develop resources, on                      
              investment in extraction capital, and on the timing of resource                
              recovery.  The empirical studies will focus on the pattern of                  
              deforestation that results from commercial logging, the incentive              
              to invest in plantation forests, the mix of commercial products                
              obtained from forests, the extent of fossil fuel exploration in                
              developing countries, and the rate at which fossil fuel resources              
              are extracted.  Data on the stability of political institutions,               
              across countries and over time, are used to indicate ownership                 
              security.  In addition, the effect of ownership insecurity on the              
              frequency and structure of transactions involving natural and                  
              environmental assets will also be analyzed.  The transactions to               
              be studied are debt-for-resource swaps and contracts involving                 
              exploration and development rights for fossil fuels.
