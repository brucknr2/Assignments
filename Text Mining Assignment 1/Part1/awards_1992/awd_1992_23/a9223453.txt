Abstract    :
              9223453  Tubbesing  This award provides partial support for the Fifth National 
              Conference on Earthquake Engineering (5NCEE), which is part  of a series of
              national conferences on earthquake  engineering.  The 5NCEE, which will be held
              in Chicago in  July, 1994, will provide a valuable service to the National 
              Earthquake Hazards Reduction Program by offering guidance on  future research
              needs in earthquake engineering and related  fields.  The conference will also
              provide a context for  researchers and practitioners in relevant technical 
              disciplines to come together to exchange experiences and  ideas.  The
              conference proceedings should be a valuable  source of information to help
              facilitate future advances in  the field of earthquake engineering.  ***
