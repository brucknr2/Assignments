Abstract    :
              9223637  King    Nearly everyone who has ever done quantitative analysis in 
              political science has come across the problem of needing data where  none
              exist.  One might have found the right survey, but it is  missing a critical
              question.  A researcher may have data on U.S  states, but not all the
              information is known for all states.   Likewise, a researcher may have data on
              the cities but not the rest  of the United States.      The investigators study
              one important aspect of this problem:   handling missing data in the analysis
              of a dataset organized as a  time series of cross-sections; a problem for which
              no adequate  solution presently exist.  This problem arose as an important 
              obstacle in two distinct areas of the substantive research  undertaken by the
              investigators, one involving data comprising a  series of presidential "trial
              heat" polls and, the other, a large  quantity of legilslative electoral data. 
              In searching for a  solution, the investigators found that the problem is much
              more  general and has arisen at least implicitly in statistics, political 
              methodology, and numerous areas of substantive research in  political science
              and elsewhere.  The researchers plan to  generalize the existing statistical
              method of "multiple  imputation," simulating data mathematically, to deal with
              data such  as these.  ***
