Abstract    :
                   Continued funding is provided for a fellowship program                    
              entitled "On-Site Research to Advance Industrial Quality and                   
              Productivity."  Jointly sponsored by the National Science                      
              Foundation and the National Institute of Standards and Technology              
              (NIST), the program will be administered by the American                       
              Statistical Association while NIST acts as the host agency.  This              
              program is designed to bridge gaps between quality assurance                   
              efforts in industry, academia and government through the                       
              formation of research teams of industrial, academic, and NIST                  
              statisticians and engineers.  Possible areas of research for                   
              Fellows ar statistical design of industrial experiments, process               
              control, studies of advanced manufacturing systems, computing for              
              engineering and industrial statistics, and calibration of                      
              manufacturing process control.                                                 
                   Continued funding is provided for a fellowship program,                   
              designed to have academic statisticians and engineers studying                 
              industrial problems, especially in the area of quality assurance.
