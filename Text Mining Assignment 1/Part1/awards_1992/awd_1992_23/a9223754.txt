Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Description:  This project supports living                                     
              expenses for a scientist from India to                                         
              participate in research at the laboratory of                                   
              Dr. Bruce Geller at Oregon State University.                                   
              The Indian scientist, Dr. S.K. Babu of the                                     
              Department of Dairy Bacteriology, College of                                   
              Dairy Science, Udaipur, India, is to study the                                 
              molecular mechanism of bacteriophage infections                                
              of lactic acid bacteria Lactococcus lactis.                                    
              This species of bacteria is required to make                                   
              many varieties of cheese, including the most                                   
              common variety in the U.S.  Dr. Babu will clone                                
              and sequence spontaneously-occuring mutants in                                 
              the gene required for bacteriophage infection.                                 
              He will make copies of the mutant genes by                                     
              polymerase chain reaction.  Total chromosomal                                  
              DNA from each of the spontaneous mutants in                                    
              this gene will serve as the hybridization                                      
              template for the polymerase chain reaction.                                    
                                                                                             
              Scope:  This project helps a U.S. scientist who                                
              is carrying on work of significant relevance to                                
              the U.S. industry, through participation of a                                  
              qualified young Indian scientist.  It also                                     
              helps the Indian scientist by his involvement                                  
              in a multifaceted research program and learning                                
              new techniques that he can implement later in                                  
              his home institute.
