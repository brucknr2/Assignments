Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This project will supply shipboard scientific equipment for the                
              research vessel NEW HORIZON operated by the Scripps Institution of             
              Oceanography, and dedicated to use in support of ocean science                 
              research.                                                                      
                                                                                             
              The Shipboard Scientific Equipment Program provides funds for ship             
              equipment deemed essential to the proper and safe conduct of ocean             
              science research.  The Program provides support for such items as              
              deck equipment including winch systems for the deployment and                  
              retrieval of scientific instruments, navigational equipment such as            
              radars, gyroscopes and earth satellite receivers to pin point the              
              location of research sites, communication equipment including radio            
              transceivers and satellite transceivers for voice and scientific               
              data communications and other equipment such as motorized workboats            
              for transporting scientists to and from data retrieval sites.                  
                                                                                             
              The Project Director, Robert A. Knox is fully qualified to direct              
              this project having had considerable experience in overseeing the              
              acquisition and installation of shipboard equipment.                           
                                                                                             
              This project will allow the institution to acquire and install a               
              traction winch for the NEW HORIZON.
