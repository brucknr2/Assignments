Abstract    :
                   This award supports the development of methods to determine               
              paleo-elevations from the physiognomy of fossil plants and to apply            
              the methods to constrain the history of regional elevation changes             
              of western North America.  Using multivariate statistics,                      
              correlations will be sought among physiognomic characteristics of              
              plant assemblages, various average temperatures (mean annual                   
              temperature, mean daytime temperature, mean summer temperature,                
              etc.), and various average moisture parameters (relative humidity,             
              vapor pressure, or mixing ratio of vapor to dry air).  The goal is             
              to determine what average temperature and what moisture parameters             
              can be determined from fossil assemblages, and what uncertainties              
              characterize such determinations.  Simultaneously, meteorological              
              data will be used to search for thermodynamic variables of the                 
              atmosphere that are as independent of altitude and longitude as                
              possible.  Specifically, the moist static energy and the equivalent            
              potential temperature will be calculated using mean temperatures               
              and corresponding mean mixing ratios for meteorological stations in            
              North America.  In combination, these parameters will determine                
              paleo-altitudes and allow a better determination of climate and                
              environmental history.
