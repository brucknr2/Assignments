Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Department of Astronomy and Physics at the University of                       
              California, Los Angeles (UCLA), in collaboration with Caltech and              
              JPL, propose to hold a timely conference entitled Infrared                     
              Astronomy with Arrays:  the next generation on the UCLA campus from            
              July 18-22, 1993.  Infrared array detectors have been in widespread            
              use for only 5 or 6 years, but already their impact on infrared                
              astronomy has been tremendous.  Efforts to design and construct                
              even better IR arrays with larger formats have also continued at a             
              rapid pace.  By the date of the proposed conference, many infrared             
              instruments using arrays with up to 256x256 pixels will be in                  
              operation.  The UCLA meeting will bring together, in a unique                  
              forum, astronomers, technologists and IR array manufacturers, to               
              see and hear about the exciting science that is already being done,            
              to exchange knowledge on methods of operation and data reduction,              
              and to discuss future prospects in the era of very large ground-               
              based telescopes, Antarctic astronomy and space missions dedicated             
              to infrared science.  Equally important, the conference will                   
              produce direct interactions between developers and a large, and                
              growing, number of users and will serve to focus the concern of the            
              community on funding detector improvements and ensuring                        
              availability of future supplies at this critical juncture.                     
                                                                                             
              This meeting, although aimed primarily at ground-based infrared                
              astronomy, will capitalize on the synergism with space-based                   
              applications.  The conference will be modelled on the successful               
              "turning-point" workshop held in March 1987 in Hilo.  The                      
              conference is timely since it has been three years since the most              
              closely related event.
