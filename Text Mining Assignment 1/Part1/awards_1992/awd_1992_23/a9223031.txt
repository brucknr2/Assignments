Abstract    :
              This conference, "This Transcription Machine: Structures and                   
              Functions" will be held in Austin, TX from April 2-4, 1993 meeting             
              will cover areas such as how DNA-Protein and protein-protein                   
              interactions lead to assembly of functional transcription                      
              complexes, how long-range interactions permit recognition between              
              various transcription factors, and the genetic and developmental               
              consequences of transcriptional control.  NSF funds will be used to            
              support travel of young and minority scientists to attend the                  
              meeting.

              This conference covers an important and rapidly developing field.              
              The format and setting of the conference provides a good                       
              environment for interaction of young scientists with established               
              investigators in the field.
