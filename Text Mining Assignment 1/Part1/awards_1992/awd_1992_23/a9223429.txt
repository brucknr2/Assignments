Abstract    :
              The focus of this research will involve the use of                             
              cation-stabilizing (C-S) auxiliaries to enhance the yield,                     
              stereo- and regioselectivity of polyene cyclization processes.                 
              The role of the auxiliaries will be explored by placing them at                
              varied positions on the substrate, by developing new C-S                       
              functional groups, by studying the effect of using two or more                 
              C-S functions and by applying the concept to the synthesis of                  
              hitherto difficult to obtain polycyclics of biological                         
              importance.  A second focus will involve the use of chiral                     
              acetals to induce asymmetric synthesis.

              With this Accomplishment Based Renewal, the Synthetic Organic                  
              Program is supporting the research of Dr. William S. Johnson of                
              the Department of Chemistry at Stanford university.  Professor                 
              Johnson will focus his work on developing reactions that mimic,                
              and even rival in efficiency, enzymatic ring-forming processes                 
              which form polycyclic carbon compounds of biological                           
              importance.
