Abstract    :
              This project has two objectives: (1) to develop a theoretical                  
              framework that integrates and extends existing models of capital               
              investment; and (2) to apply this framework to data on capital                 
              investment by firms and by industries.  The theoretical framework              
              emphasizes the costs of adjusting the size of the capital stock                
              and includes the facts that firms may pay a higher price for                   
              capital when they buy than when they sell capital, that it may                 
              cost more per unit to adjust the capital stock quickly rather                  
              than slowly, and that adjusting the capital stock may involve                  
              fixed costs.  Rather than explore the role of a single adjustment              
              technology in isolation, this model specification allows the                   
              nesting of possible adjustment costs, resale market                            
              imperfections, and acquisition costs, while further allowing for               
              fixed adjustment costs and irreversible investment.  Also, the                 
              resulting investment function is simple enough to admit direct                 
              empirical examination, and the tractability of aggregation                     
              problems  allows estimation in both firm-level and industry level              
              data.  This research is important because it holds the prospect                
              of making an important break through in better understanding the               
              investment behavior of firms and industries.
