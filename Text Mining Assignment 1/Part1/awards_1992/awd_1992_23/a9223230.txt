Abstract    :
              This project studies the electronic and vibrational excitation,                
              energy-migration, and relaxation processes, involving various                  
              molecular and electronic defects in ordered and disordered ionic               
              solids.  Research will include electron-vibration energy transfer              
              processes between F-centers and molecular defects will be                      
              investigated using resonance Raman scattering, vibrational                     
              luminescence and Fourier transform infra-red spectroscopy.  A newly            
              developed technique will be used to produce high quality ultra-thin            
              crystals in the range 0.2 - 100 m.  The influence of the                      
              mesoscopic size on the films on the energy-transfer and phase                  
              behavior of the materials will be investigated and may lead to new             
              optical materials or research possibilities.

              This project involves the study of the optical properties of                   
              materials which are typically used in laser devices.  One area of              
              interest is that of energy transfer processes that need to be                  
              understood in order to optimize the optical and lasing properties              
              of materials.  Another important area is that of thin films of                 
              optical materials, where the reduced size of the medium changes the            
              properties of crystals in new and incompletely understood ways.                
              The study of these materials may lead to new laser materials or                
              devise applications.
