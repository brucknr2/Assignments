Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The Massachusetts Institute of Technology will undertake an instru-            
              mentation development project to further advance the use of flow               
              cytometry for ocean science research purposes.  Flow cytometers                
              were originally developed for the biomedical research community.               
              Flow cytometers have developed into effective tools for biological             
              oceanographic research, by rapidly providing information on samples            
              containing particles as small as marine bacteria to large single-              
              celled phytoplankton.  This work will bring several unique                     
              capabilities to flow cytometric analysis of pelagic ecosystems:                
              synoptic analysis (light scatter, abundance, and autofluorescence              
              of plankton ranging from 0.3 to 100 microns in diameter); detailed             
              analysis of light scatter signals through digital signal                       
              processing; and advanced, real-time neural-network analysis of                 
              population parameters.  These enhanced capabilities will facilitate            
              process studies by population ecologists and they will contribute              
              to the development of remote sensing algorithms.
