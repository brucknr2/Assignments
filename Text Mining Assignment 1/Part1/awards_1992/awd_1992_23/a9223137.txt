Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This series of annual Summer Institutes in Game Theory and                     
              Economics is designed to stimulate and disseminate new advances in             
              research on game theory and its applications and to make conceptual            
              and methodological developments in game theory available to an                 
              expanding group of scientists in economics and other disciplines.              
              Each year the month-long program of research-oriented conferences              
              and workshops and an intensive course of instruction on a topic of             
              major significance, complemented by a further period of informal               
              research activities, will bring together a large international                 
              group of researchers - a mix of established scholars, junior                   
              faculty, and graduate students - whose interests represent a                   
              diverse array of theoretical and applied aspects of game theory.               
                                                                                             
              The programs proposed for 1993-1995 are a continuation of the                  
              series of Summer Institutes held at Stonybrook in 1990, 1991, and              
              1992, each of which attracted more than 200 participants.  Formal              
              activities include a five-day conference with plenary and parallel             
              sessions, and invited and contributed papers; two weeks of                     
              workshops on selected themes; and one to two weeks of intensive                
              instruction on selected topics.  The value of this format and                  
              approach is evidenced by the success of the previous Institutes.
