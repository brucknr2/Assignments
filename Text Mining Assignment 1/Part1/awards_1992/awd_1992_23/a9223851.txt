Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Predators may play an important role in the evolution                          
              of diet specialization in phytophagous insects.  This                          
              research will test the hypothesis that specialists are                         
              chemically and morphologically better defended against                         
              predation than generalists by offering both generalist                         
              and specialist lepidopteran larvae to two different                            
              invertebrate predators, Apiomerus pictipes (assassin                           
              bug) and Polistes carnifex (paper wasp) at Palo Verde                          
              National Park, Costa Rica.  To test separately for the                         
              importance of prey chemistry as a determinant of                               
              predator rejections, we will also offer caterpillar                            
              extracts to the same predators.  Results indicating                            
              that prey chemistry is an important deterrent to                               
              predators would only provide relatively weak evidence                          
              that plant chemistry is also important.  Therefore, to                         
              test the importance of plant chemistry we will also                            
              rear specialist caterpillars on artificial diets                               
              containing varying amounts of host plant and offer                             
              those caterpillars and their extracts to the predators.                        
                                                                                             
              Diet breadth of phytophagous insects is an important                           
              and current issue to evolutionary biology and ecology,                         
              including the potential for herbivorous insects to                             
              become serious agricultural pests.  This project is the                        
              first to test the combined importance of plant                                 
              chemistry and predation in determining diet breadth.
