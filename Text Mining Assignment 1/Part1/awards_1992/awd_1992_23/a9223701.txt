Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This project continues research begun under an earlier NSF grant               
              on the dynamics and learning in multistage games.  Since                       
              experiments, oligopoly experiments, bargaining experiments,                    
              committee experiments, and experiments in many other settings                  
              studied by social scientists are conducted by multi-stage games,               
              a better understanding of these dynamics is critical to the kinds              
              of inferences that can be made from the data.  This project                    
              develops a unified theoretical and econometric approach with a                 
              structure that permits the rigorous analysis of diverse                        
              experimental data from multi-stage games.                                      
                                                                                             
              The theoretical development involves modification of standard                  
              game theoretic analysis by introducing random errors in actions                
              (trembles) and beliefs (home-made priors and non-Bayesian                      
              updating).  Different specifications of these random components,               
              including assumptions about the degree to which subjects take                  
              errors into account in their own decision making, lead to several              
              classes of models which can be rigorously evaluated and compared               
              using data from simple experimental games.  These alternative                  
              models can also be used to rigorously analyze - for the first                  
              time - data from earlier experiments that offer descriptive                    
              evidence about what appear to be systematic departures from fully              
              rational behavior.
