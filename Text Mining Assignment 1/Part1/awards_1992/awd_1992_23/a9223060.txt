Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The aim of this research is to investigate synthesis, structure,               
              and properties of new early transition metal sulfide phases.  The              
              proposed compounds will have perovskite related or layer structures            
              and transition metals with do to d1 configurations.  A variety of              
              synthetic techniques will be employed such as BaCl2 flux reactions,            
              CS2 sulfiding reactions, and sulventothermal reactions.  All                   
              compounds will be characterized by XRD, transport, and magnetic                
              measurements.  These compounds will allow comparisons of the                   
              structures and properties of isocompositional oxides and sulfides              
              in the areas where metal insulator transitions occur.  The                     
              importance of structure and covalency in the formation of new                  
              metallic solids will be addressed.

              The aim of this research is to investigate synthesis, structure,               
              and properties of new classes of unexplored solid state materials.             
              These compounds will comprise early transition metals (Ti, Zr, Hf,             
              V, Nb, Ta) and sulfur.  Attempts are made to design features into              
              these materials that are known to be important in the copper oxide             
              superconductors.  The atomic structure and properties of the new               
              materials will be determined.  The importance of structure and                 
              bonding in the formation of new materials, with desirable                      
              properties such as metallic behavior and/or superconductivity, will            
              be addressed.
