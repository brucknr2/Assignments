Abstract    :
              Tyler/Abstract           The objective of this research is to investigate the 
              combination of propagation, meteorological, and measurement  problems
              associated with an Earth occultation observing system.  In  comparison with
              exploratory measurements of other planets or  measurements of less dynamic and
              complex atmospheres farther from  the sun, occultation measurement of Earth's
              atmosphere is believed  to present a considerable challenge.  In the area of
              radio-wave  propagation, we will investigate the effects on radio occultation 
              measurements of:  (i) local departures from spherical symmetry in  the
              terrestrial atmosphere (e.g., due to weather fronts and  baroclinicity);  (ii)
              diffraction of radio waves, which will occur  frequently in terrestrial
              occultations (e.g., due to small-scale  gravity waves or abrupt refractive
              variations in the ocean boundary  layer);  (iii) multipath propagation, which
              occurs in connection  with complex refractivity structures and is at a minimum
              an  important factor in preventing reliable GPS/MET observations of the  lowest
              several km of the atmosphere;  and (iv) critical layers  (i.e., ducts) in the
              basic refractivity structure, which  fundamentally limit the region of the
              atmosphere accessible to  remote sensing through radio occultation.  With
              regard to item  (ii), the standard retrieval algorithm (Abel inversion) for
              radio  occultation data ignores diffraction effects and we will attempt to 
              develop (and apply) a new algorithm that, by properly accounting  for
              diffraction, can yield profiles at enhanced, sub-Fresnel-scale  vertical
              resolution.  These propagation effects will be studied  with the dual
              objectives of better understanding radio occultation  data already acquired
              with the GPS/MET instrument on Micro Lab 1  and of gaining insight toward the
              design of an advanced GPS  receiver that can be used to collect radio
              occultation data on  future satellite  missions.  With regard to the former, we
              will  analyze a subset of GPS/MET data with emphasis on areas  (e.g.,  studies
              of atmospheric waves) where the data have not yet been  fully utilized.
