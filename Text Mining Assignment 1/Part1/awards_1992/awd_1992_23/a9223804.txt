Abstract    :
              Theoretical research will be conducted on polymer systems.                     
              Theories will be developed for calculating corrections to Flory-               
              Huggins theory for the thermodynamic properties of polymer melts,              
              blends and block copolymer systems.  Studies will be made of the               
              influence of monomer structure, local correlations, equation of                
              state effects, etc., on interfacial widths and tensions of phase               
              separated polymer blends, on the validity of a mean field                      
              description of blends, and on the microphase separation transition             
              in block copolymer systems.  The theory will be developed further              
              to treat rigid rods and extended rigid particles in order to                   
              describe polymer liquid crystals.  Computations will be performed              
              of altered chain dimensions in binary blends and diblock copolymer             
              systems to assess their influence on theories of microphase                    
              separation.  A theory of long time dynamics of flexible protein                
              molecules will be further developed by evaluating the memory                   
              functions in terms of input equilibrium information and including              
              them into the generalized Rouse-Zimm approach.  Appropriate                    
              simulations will be used to test the assumptions of the theory and             
              to suggest directions for further improvements.

              This renewal grant will continue studies of theories for polymeric             
              materials.  A variety of polymer systems will be studied and                   
              appropriate theory will be developed.  The principal investigator              
              is one of the leading polymer theorists and this work will help                
              understand these complex, but technologically important, materials.
