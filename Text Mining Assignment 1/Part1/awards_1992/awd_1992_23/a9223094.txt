Abstract    :
                    Communication and synchronization among processes is of  fundamental
              importance in parallel and distributed systems.  Together, they have an impact
              on the efficiency, the  design, and the understanding of concurrent programs. 
              This  research aims at examining shared variable and message passing  systems
              with respect to mechanisms for interprocess  communication and synchronization.
               In the case of shared variable  systems, the question of cache coherence and
              the  appropriateness of non-atomic shared memory is  considered.  Proof
              techniques and programming methodologies  are developed for dealing with
              non-atomic memories.  In the  case of message passing systems, the question of
              locality of  computations is investigated.  Complexity measures that  measure
              locality and efficient algorithms for  commonly occurring synchronization
              problems are developed.  The impact of failures and dynamic networks on
              algorithms and  tight lower bounds on various performance measures are 
              explored.  Finally, the research examines mixed  programming paradigms that
              support both shared memory and  message passing.  As a part of this research,
              efficient  simulations of shared memory on an underlying message passing 
              architecture are designed.
