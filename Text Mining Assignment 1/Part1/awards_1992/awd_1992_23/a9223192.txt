Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  This research will explore the applicability of genetic                   
              algorithms and classifier systems to the analysis of social                    
              interaction, seeking to provide a formally-based understanding.                
              The forms of stable interaction range from highly-scripted,                    
              instrumentalized social action to informal group processes                     
              sustained by the rationality of individual participants.  The                  
              techniques will be applied to three domains: social exchange,                  
              collective action, and action organization.  A key advantage of                
              this research is the power of the computer techniques to represent             
              all forms of interaction in terms of an evolving population of                 
              genotypical action plans and thus to provide the basis for an                  
              integrated theory of social interaction systems that covers the                
              full range of commonly recognized system types.                                
                                                                                             
                   Sociology has been slow to make use of several new approaches             
              in computer technology, and this research will be the first                    
              substantial sociological application of the related techniques of              
              genetic algorithms and classifier systems.  Genetic algorithms are             
              a way of arriving at a solution to a problem through successive                
              approximation, with the great advantage that it develops many                  
              potential solutions simultaneously, successively combining features            
              of different solutions and selecting the best solutions for further            
              development.  In the context of this research, classifer systems               
              read computerized strings of symbols, such as the units produced by            
              genetic algorithms, and interpret them as rules for human action               
              under specified circumstances.
