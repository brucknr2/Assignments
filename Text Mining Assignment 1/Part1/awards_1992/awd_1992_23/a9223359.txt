Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This is a study of manufacturing enterprises in Bulgaria, 500 of               
              them state owned and 100 new private companies, that will examine              
              factors associated with success and failure over a four-year time              
              span.   Data from the first wave of this longitudinal survey have              
              already been collected, and subsequent waves will add data from                
              surveys and official sources.  This study will test sociological               
              theories of organization ecology that predict success of                       
              enterprises is shaped by the age of the enterprise, its size,                  
              structural inertia, dynamics of population density, environmental              
              imprinting, niche width, and r-versus-K strategies.  The study will            
              also apply theories from neoclassical economics and from several               
              competing economic approaches.                                                 
                                                                                             
              This study capitalizes upon a unique opportunity to examine a                  
              society that is struggling to escape from totalitarian government              
              and a demand economy to develop the institutions of a free market.             
              The chief scientific goal is to test general theories of the                   
              success and failure of enterprises in an environment of rapid                  
              social change, but the study will also generate a substantial data             
              base that will be of great use to many economists and sociologists             
              in research projects of many kinds.
