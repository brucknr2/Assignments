Abstract    :
                   The long term goal of the proposed research is to understand              
              the interactions which regulate a synergistic virus infection.                 
              Experiments focus on synergistic interactions between potato virus             
              X (PVX) and any of several related viruses from the potyvirus group            
              of plant viruses.  The PVX/potyvirus synergisms are characterized              
              by a large increase in the level of PVX in co-infected cells as                
              compared to cells infected with PVX only, but no corresponding                 
              increase or decrease in the level of the potyvirus.  Our recent                
              work indicates that the regulation of PVX RNA replication is                   
              altered in the synergistic co-infections.  The main focus of this              
              proposal is to delineate the potyviral sequences which regulate                
              various aspects of the PVX/potyviral synergism using stable                    
              transformation experiments in whole plants and in synchronously                
              infected protoplasts.  A further aim is to clarify the role of long            
              distance viral movement in localization of the acute synergistic               
              response.                                                                      
              %%%                                                                            
              Recent studies have shown similarities in diverse plant and animal             
              viruses based on genome organization, mechanisms of gene                       
              expression, and sequence homology of virally encoded, nonstructural            
              proteins.  These results suggest that elucidation of molecular                 
              mechanisms for virus interactions obtained in one system may well              
              apply to a diverse group of other virus systems.
