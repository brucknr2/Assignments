Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  The PIs describe a program of theoretical work on processes               
              occurring on the surfaces of small ice particles in the atmosphere.            
              The plan is to adapt existing models of crystal growth with and                
              without impurities to the cases of atmospheric interest.  Focus                
              will be on the effects of foreign gases and impurities, surface                
              heating and surface melting on the growth and evaporation rates of             
              ice particles.  The work will be carried out in close cooperation              
              with two groups engaged in relevant laboratory experiments and one             
              group making field measurements, and will build on theoretical work            
              already underway in the PI's group.
