Abstract    :
              In this work we will develop methodology based on new                          
              instrumentation which can be used for structural analysis of                   
              molecules of biological importance, i.e. peptides and post-                    
              translationally modified peptides.  In particular, this will                   
              involve further development of an ion trap/reflectron time-of-                 
              flight mass spectrometer and the development of the various                    
              capabilities that result from a combination of these two                       
              technologies.  This device will be used to obtain structure and                
              sequence information on large peptides and modified peptides                   
              using electrospray or matrix-assisted laser desorption (MALDI) to              
              produce ions externally for injection into the trap.  The ion                  
              trap will act as a front end storage device for a time-of-flight               
              mass spectrometer with capabilities for long-term storage thus                 
              providing the possibility for ultra trace analysis.  In addition,              
              this will provide the ability to investigate photodissociation                 
              and collision induced dissociation of these large ions in the                  
              trap with detection of long-lived metastable fragmentation.  This              
              will be especially important in the case of large molecules which              
              may only dissociate on a long time scale (>10 ms) that is beyond               
              the capabilities of many mass spectrometer.  In addition, various              
              factors that will allow sufficient fragmentation for                           
              interpretation of the structure of these large peptides will be                
              investigated.  Ultimately, using fragmentation patterns and                    
              metastable ion analysis provided using a reflectron time-of-                   
              flight, the capabilities of this methodology for structural                    
              analysis will be evaluated.
