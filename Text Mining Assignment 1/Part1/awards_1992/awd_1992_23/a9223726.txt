Abstract    :
              9223726  Boyd  We will perform experimental and theoretical work aimed at the
              development of new nonlinear optical materials with improved nonlinear
              response. The basic idea of our approach is to form a composite material of two
              (or more) constituents that differ both in their linear and nonlinear optical
              properties.  The electric field of an applied optical wave will therefor be
              nonuniformly distributed between the two constituents,  leading to an effective
              nonlinear susceptibility of the composite that can exceed that of either of its
              constituent materials.  In our initial theoretical studies, we have discovered
              realistic conditions in which such a local-field enhancement can be at least a
              factor of five.  In our approach, both constituents can be optically lossless,
              and thus our approach should be distinguished from recent work involving metal
              colloids and semiconductor-doped glasses in which the composite material is
              necessarily absorbing.  Experiments to be performed as part of this
              investigation are aimed both at developing a fundamental understanding of the
              role of local field effects in determining the nonlinear optical properties of
              composite materials and at developing actual composite materials with improved
              nonlinear response.  Our method is general in scope, that is, it is applicable
              to both second- and third-order nonlinear optical materials and it can be used
              to increase the nonlinear optical response of essentially any homogeneous
              optical material by forming a composite out of that material.  However, our
              initial experimental studies will consider the enhancement in the nonlinear
              optical properties of polymeric optical materials.    ***
