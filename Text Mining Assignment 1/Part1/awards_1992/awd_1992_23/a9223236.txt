Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Are recessions cleansing?  Do they weed out outdated technologies              
              so that firms emerge lean and mean?  Do recessions have permanent              
              effects on the level of productivity and output?  Are more new                 
              products introduced during booms than during recessions?  Are                  
              business cycle fluctuations bad for innovation and hence growth?               
              This project helps answer these questions by examining the                     
              interaction between innovation and business cycles.  The                       
              investigation involves both structural modeling and empirical                  
              research.                                                                      
                                                                                             
              More specifically, the model of process innovation developed                   
              emphasizes the learning curve dynamics of adopting a new                       
              production process.  The model has a rich set of testable                      
              implications, and these will be confronted by U.S. data on                     
              manufacturing industries.  The data are culled from a compendium               
              of trade journal articles covering 1972 to the present.  The                   
              focus is on the cyclicality of product innovation, and on whether              
              most new goods are producer or consumer goods; durable or                      
              nondurable goods; complements or substitutes for existing goods.               
              The model of product innovation is guided by the empirical                     
              evidence documented in the data set.  The analysis is of research              
              firms facing exogenous demand shocks.  Implications of durability              
              of the new products and substitutability between new and existing              
              products are developed.
