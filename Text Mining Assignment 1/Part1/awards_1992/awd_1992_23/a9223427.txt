Abstract    :
                      Meetings of the International Cartographic Association                 
              are held every two years.  More than 500 cartographers and                     
              scientists and practitioners from related disciplines                          
              convene at these meetings to learn the latest research                         
              results, to plan future collaborative research activities,                     
              to examine the latest equipment and techniques, and to meet                    
              other professionals who share their interests.  This award                     
              provides $9,000 to enable nine U.S. cartographers to attend                    
              and participate in the next ICA meeting, which will be held                    
              in Cologne, Germany, in May 1993.  Distribution of group-                      
              travel funds will be made by a subcommittee of the U.S.                        
              National Committee of the ICA.  One-half of the funds                          
              awarded will be used to support participation at the ICA                       
              meeting of three younger scientists.                                           
                      Group-travel support through this award will enable                    
              more Americans to attend and participate in the 1993 ICA                       
              meeting.  Their participation at this meeting will enable                      
              them to stay informed on new research results and to plan                      
              future activities.  Because special emphasis is being given                    
              to the support of members of groups that have been                             
              underrepresented in past ICA activities, the quality and                       
              range of scientific activities facilitated by this meeting                     
              will be even greater.
