Abstract    :
              This project introduces a framework for inference using                        
              qualitative and quantitative information.  It is designed for                  
              applications where the researcher is faced with the problem of                 
              drawing inferences of an unobservable state variable in a time                 
              series context.  Quantitative information is taken to be                       
              observable time series variables.  Qualitative information is                  
              taken to be an indicator (dummy) variable that is coded by the                 
              researcher and that reflects the researcher's distillation of                  
              literary materials that is believed to contain information about               
              the true unobserved state variable.  The framework is based on an              
              iterative algorithm that produces an inference oaf the                         
              unobservable for each sample period using the two types of                     
              information and presents a probabilistic assessment of how useful              
              an indicator of the true unobserved state is the indicator                     
              variable proposed by the researcher.                                           
                                                                                             
              The framework's output fills a gap in the applied                              
              macroeconometric literature that was created by the recent                     
              revival of interest in the use of qualitative information in                   
              macroeconomic analysis.  It also complements classical regression              
              analysis in cases where qualitative events are important by                    
              providing a novel way of assessing dummy variables.  Finally,                  
              theoretical applications of the approach to inference suggest                  
              that the algorithm could be used by policymakers when policy                   
              depends in part on an inference of an unobservable.
