Abstract    :
                   This action will continue the support for the REU Site at                 
              Georgia Tech.  Approximately fifteen undergraduates will spend                 
              the summer participating in a broad research program in                        
              chemical, optical, and condensed matter physics.                               
              Participation by women and minority students will be                           
              particularly encouraged.
