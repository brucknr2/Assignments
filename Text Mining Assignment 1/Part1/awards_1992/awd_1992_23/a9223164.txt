Abstract    :
                   This study is aimed at diagnosing processes responsible for               
              low-frequency variations in the general circulation of the                     
              atmosphere relevant to climate dynamics.                                       
                   The PIs plan to identify the mechanisms that give rise to                 
              changes in atmospheric angular momentum (AAM) on interannual and               
              longer time scales.  Newly available data sets will be used to                 
              examine the surface torques responsible for ENSO anomalies in AAM              
              and the manner in which the surface sources and sinks of momentum              
              are linked to behavior in the upper troposphere.  Stationary wave              
              activity fluxes will be computed to investigate further the way in             
              which low-frequency variations in tropical angular momentum become             
              communicated to the extratropics.  Regions responsible for the                 
              presence of regimes in the AAM time series and in the Hadley                   
              circulation will be determined using the 30-year archive of zonal              
              and meridional winds in the General Circulation Data Library.                  
              Finally, the Pi will update and extend their analysis of the impact            
              of doubling CO2 on zonal winds and AAM by considering suitable                 
              experiments with current versions of general circulation models.               
                   This research is important because it strives to understand               
              how variations in the earth's angular momentum affects atmospheric             
              processes on interannual and interdecadal time scales.
