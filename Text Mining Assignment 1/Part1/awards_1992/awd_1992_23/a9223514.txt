Abstract    :
              This award is made under the Advanced Materials and Processing                 
              Program in the Chemistry Division in support of the research of                
              Dr. Singmaster-Hernandez.  The research will provide an                        
              understanding of the microscopic chemical processes leading to both            
              laser-assisted and pyrolytic thin metal film deposition from the               
              Group VI hexacarbonyls.  Film composition and morphology will be               
              probed by Scanning Auger Spectroscopy.  The chemical vapor                     
              deposition process will be coupled with cryogenic matrix isolation             
              of the reactive intermediates.  Matrix isolated species will be                
              identified by Fourier Transform Infrared and UV-Visible                        
              spectroscopies.  Both studies will complement each other and                   
              provide additional insight into the mechanisms of film deposition,             
              incorporation of impurities, and possible insights into ways that              
              film impurities can be removed or prevented.

              A fundamental understanding of the mechanism of thin metal film                
              deposition and the intermediates involved will be of great value to            
              the microelectronics industry.
