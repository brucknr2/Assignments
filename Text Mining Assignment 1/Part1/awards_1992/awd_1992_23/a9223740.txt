Abstract    :
              Schlag         This research addresses the problem of multi-way  partitioning of
              large designs onto multiple FPGA systems.  The  task is challenging because the
              partitioning methods must  accurately assess and enhance routing so that the
              partitions can  be successfully implemented on individual FPGAs.  Existing 
              methods result in poor device utilization because they rely on  very
              conservative rules-of-thumb to ensure the successful place-  and-route of
              individual FPGAs.  This work has the following  specific goals:  1.     to
              develop new methods for assessing the intrinsic routing  requirements of system
              designs with respect to the architectural  resources of FPGAs;  2.     to
              develop effective methods for exercising the tradeoff  between logic and
              routing resources in heterogeneous FPGA  architectures; and  3.     to
              incorporate these advances within an integrated  routability-driven multi-way
              partitioning and technology mapping  strategy that will allow effective
              utilization of the  reconfigurable hardware resource.         In addition to
              new techniques for routability analysis,  partitioning and technology mapping,
              the research develops new  insights into the synergy between system-level
              interconnect  architecture, FPGA device architecture, routability, and 
              partitioning.
