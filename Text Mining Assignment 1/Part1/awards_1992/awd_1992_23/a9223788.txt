Abstract    :
                9223788  Walpole    Supporting Predictable Latency and Throughput in Large
              Storage  Systems    This is the first year funding of a three-year continuing
              award.   This research is concerned with the design of storage systems that 
              can hide the latency associated with accessing high-capacity  distributed
              storage and hence support guaranteed latency and  throughput.  The main
              objectives of the project are to (1) define  new storage system interfaces that
              allow quality-of-service and  synchronization requirements to be passed to the
              storage system;  (2) define a storage system architecture that can use this 
              information to hide storage access latency; and (3) implement a  prototype
              latency-hiding storage system.  The principle method  underlying the
              latency-hiding storage system is prefetching, which  is based on information
              gathered from applications through the  storage system interfaces described
              above.  A storage system with  these characteristics will significantly reduce
              the burden on  programmers of multimedia applications, particularly those based
              on  stored audio and video, and will help to facilitate the development  of
              multimedia computing in large-scale systems.   ***
