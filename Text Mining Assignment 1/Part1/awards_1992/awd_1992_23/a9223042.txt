Abstract    :
              Significant global scale decreases in total ozone, an atmospheric              
              gas surrounding the earth, have occurred during the past decades.              
              With the depletion of the ozone layer, the atmosphere becomes                  
              more transparent to solar ultraviolet radiation. It is well                    
              established from laboratory experiments that ultraviolet                       
              radiation can have a deleterious effect on living organisms.                   
              Ultraviolet radiation can affect the genetic material of cells                 
              and can affect various cellular components which regulate                      
              biological reactions controlling cell growth and reproduction.                 
              What is less known is the impact of increased ultraviolet                      
              radiation on whole organisms and on organisms in the natural                   
              environment. The focus of this workshop is to bring together                   
              scientific experts to assess the effects of ultraviolet radiation              
              on aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems. A workshop report will                  
              summarize the current status of knowledge and will develop a                   
              prioritized research plan of objectives and scientific tasks.                  
              This will provide the international scientific community with a                
              focus to address the issue of ozone depletion effects on the                   
              global system.
