Abstract    :
                   This is an interagency transfer of funds to the NASA Ames                 
              Research Center for the participation of Dr. Francisco Valero and              
              his colleagues in the Central Equatorial Pacific Experiment                    
              (CEPEX).  This experiment which will take place in March 1993 is               
              designed to test the so-called "thermostat hypothesis" which                   
              attempts to explain how sea surface temperatures are regulated in              
              the tropical Pacific through cloud radiation feedback processes.               
              Dr. Valero's group will be responsible for obtaining and analyzing             
              the required atmospheric solar and infrared radiation measurements.
