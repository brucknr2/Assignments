Abstract    :
                   This grant covers experimental Elementary Particle                        
              Physics Research on the constituent structure of matter by a                   
              group at Johns Hopkins University in collaboration with other                  
              NSF and DOE supported scientists.  The group will continue                     
              studying proton-antiproton annihilation as a member of the CDF                 
              collaboration at Fermilab.  The group will continue these                      
              studies to the highest possible energies at the                                
              Superconducting Super Collider. They will also continue                        
              research and development of silicon microstrip particle                        
              detectors at Johns Hopkins University.
