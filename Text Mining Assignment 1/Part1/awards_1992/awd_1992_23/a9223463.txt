Abstract    :
              This Workshop's purpose is to explore the                                      
              current state of Neuroengineering research                                     
              and provide a forum for addressing future                                      
              research directions.  It will be hosted by the                                 
              Institute for Systems Research (formerly                                       
              Systems Research Center) of the University of                                  
              Maryland, College Park, Maryland, under the                                    
              sponsorship of the National Science                                            
              Foundation.  Academic, industrial and                                          
              governmental laboratories will be represented                                  
              among the approximately 30 participants. Short                                 
              position-papers will be presented, with general                                
              discussion and more specialized discussions on                                 
              neural net hardware and its application,                                       
              biologically motivated approaches to                                           
              neuroengineering- particularly neurocontrol.                                   
              The Program Committee, consisting of                                           
              experienced researchers  representing several                                  
              aspects of the field, will be responsible for the                              
              choice of a well balanced panel of participants                                
              and guiding the participants toward the                                        
              production of a final written report to NSF.
