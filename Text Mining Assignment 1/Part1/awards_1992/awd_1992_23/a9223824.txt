Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The main objective of this investigation is to develop a better                
              understanding of the domestic and international conditions under               
              which state leaders: 1) decide to come to the defense of other                 
              states that face security threats (why they adopt policies of                  
              extended deterrence), and once extended deterrent policies are in              
              place, b) when will adversaries challenge the security commitments             
              of such states.  The researcher will test two alternative                      
              theoretical models of state behavior against the historical                    
              evidence of Great Power extended deterrence cases over the past 170            
              years to determine what conditions have had a consistent and strong            
              effect on the decisions of state leaders.                                      
                                                                                             
              The first model will test hypotheses which posit that foreign                  
              policy decisions are driven largely by assessments of geo-strategic            
              interests and relative military power.  In contrast, the second                
              model proposes that foreign policy decisions are driven                        
              fundamentally by domestic political and economic concerns and, as              
              a result, national security policy cannot be separated from the                
              goal of political leaders to secure and strengthen their position              
              of domestic political power and authority.                                     
                                                                                             
              The hypotheses from each model will be tested by statistical                   
              analysis and the results will address a number of more specific                
              questions which are of both scholarly and policy importance, such              
              as:  a) when are states likely to form alliances?; b) when are                 
              adversaries likely to question the extended deterrent value of an              
              alliance?; c) when will alliance partners honor their deterrent                
              commitments?; and, d) under what conditions can we expect domestic             
              political concerns to shape national security policy in fundamental            
              ways?
