Abstract    :
                   A 3D digital audio signal processing system, a 3D tracking                
              system, adapters for wireless network technologies capable of                  
              position location (radio, infrared), six notepad computers, one                
              workstation, and bus expansion boxes to connect peripherals to                 
              the requested workstation and existing computers shall be                      
              obtained in this project.  This equipment will be dedicated to                 
              support research in the Computer Graphics and User Interfaces                  
              Laboratory and the Mobile Computing Laboratory, both within the                
              Department of Computer Science at Columbia University. The                     
              equipment will be used for several research projects, including                
              in particular: development of "hybrid user interfaces'' that                   
              merge 2D and 3D displays and interaction devices; design of                    
              "augmented realities'' in which the surrounding physical world is              
              annotated with knowledge-based 3D graphics; development of                     
              virtual worlds for multivariate data visualization; invention of               
              methods for ``bandwidth aggregation'' achieved by combining                    
              distinct wireless network channels into a single high-speed                    
              channel; and development of means by which application programs                
              can sense their location and ``localize,'' customizing themselves              
              to their physical surroundings.
