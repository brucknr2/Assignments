Abstract    :
              This research project, supported in the Analytical and Surface                 
              Chemistry Program, addresses the development of an                             
              understanding of the processes which occur when molecular ions                 
              of tens of eV energy impact upon surfaces.  Surface induced                    
              dissociation (SID) and ion/surface reactions occur upon                        
              collision.  The overall goal of this work is to develop the                    
              understanding which is needed to use ion/surface collisions as                 
              a structural analysis tool in analytical mass spectrometry.                    
              Self-assembled monolayer surfaces, as well as molecular                        
              adsorbates on  characterizable gold and silver substrates will                 
              be investigated as useful surfaces for these SID applications.                 
              The range of ion/surface collision phenomena  to be explored                   
              will include low energy sputtering of ionized adsorbates,                      
              partial neutralization of doubly charged ions, and molecular                   
              beam collisions with surfaces.                                                 
              %%%                                                                            
              The structural characterization of large molecules by mass                     
              spectrometry is facilitated by the use of ion collision methods                
              which introduce significant internal energy into the analyte.                  
              A very promising approach for introducing this internal energy                 
              is the process of ion/surface collision.  Ion/surface                          
              collisions result in surface induced dissociation and reactions                
              with the surface which can be used to obtain structural                        
              information about the molecules involved.  This research                       
              project addresses the fundamental ion/surface interaction                      
              chemistry which forms the basis for this analytical approach.
