Abstract    :
              Concerns over global warming, carbon monoxide pollution and ozone              
              formation are forcing a fundamental shift in the role of                       
              alternative fuels and fuel additives in Western Hemisphere                     
              markets.  In the U.S. Clean-Air Act legislation mandates the use               
              of cleaner burning fuels.  Ethanol is the primary renewable                    
              liquid fuel alternative.  There are two major ethanol country                  
              programs in the Western Hemisphere.  The U.S has a modest, highly              
              subsidized, high cost trade-protected corn-based industry.                     
              Brazil has a larger, lower-cost, excess supply, sugarcane-based                
              ethanol program.  This project focuses on the compilation of a                 
              domestic database suitable for research into the viability of                  
              alternative liquid fuels.  The demand analysis is restricted to                
              the U.S. market to be met by both domestic and imported supplies.              
              Supply and demand changes in response to Clean-Air Act                         
              legislation are estimated.  Alternative domestic subsidy and                   
              import policies are explored within a cost-benefit framework.                  
              Polices benefitting consumers, producers, and governments with                 
              ever tightening budgets are proposed and evaluated.
