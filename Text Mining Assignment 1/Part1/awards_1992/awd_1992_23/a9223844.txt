Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This study will examine patterns of variation in body                          
              form among populations of an endemic radiation of                              
              threespine stickleback from Cook Inlet, Alaska to test                         
              current models of phenotypic evolution.  Stickleback                           
              along the west coast of North America are of interest                          
              to the evolutionary biologist because of the recent                            
              (<22,000 years) colonization of diverse freshwater                             
              habitats from a marine ancestral population and                                
              subsequent differentiation of trophic and locomotor                            
              morphology among the populations.  Body form will be                           
              measured using two-dimensional (x,y) coordinates of                            
              anatomical landmarks that permit the use of the most                           
              powerful methods available to describe and analyze                             
              shape.  Three hypotheses of a functional integration                           
              model will be tested: 1) patterns of genetic and                               
              phenotypic correlations reflect functional integration                         
              (i.e. suites of characters that function in concert                            
              should have higher correlations than functionally                              
              unrelated characters).  2) patterns of phenotypic                              
              correlation are similar among populations. 3)                                  
              interlocality and intralocality patterns of phenotypic                         
              correlations are similar.  Biomechanical models and                            
              trophic and locomotor performance measures will be used                        
              to construct a priori hypotheses to test for functional                        
              integration.  It is anticipated that results from this                         
              study will provide some of the critical empirical data                         
              necessary to resolve conflicting hypotheses on the role                        
              of constraints influencing phenotypic divergence among                         
              closely related populations.
