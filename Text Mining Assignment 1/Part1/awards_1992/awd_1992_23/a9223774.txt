Abstract    :
                   The research entails reworking the foundations of structural              
              Finsler geometry with a view to generalizing some fundamental                  
              notions of Riemannian geometry.  The methods entail several new                
              approaches previously unexploited.  Topics in submanifold theory               
              will be further investigated.  The projects are joint with                     
              several collaborators in both the US and China on an fundable                  
              cooperative basis (with International Programs).
