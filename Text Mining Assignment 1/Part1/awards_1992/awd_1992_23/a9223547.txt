Abstract    :
              This proposal requests funds to operate the Stony Brook                        
              Relativistic Heavy Ion Group.  The group is presently engaged in               
              experiments E814/E877 at the Brookhaven AGS and in the Phenix                  
              experiment at RHIC.  The main emphasis for the next three years                
              is: (a) Analysis of data for Si-Nucleus and Au-Au collisions                   
              gathered over the last year, (b) Upgrade of E877 for Au beams,                 
              (c) Analysis of data from E877 including search for effects due                
              to chiral symmetry restoration in the hot, dense phase formed in               
              Au-Au collisions by studying low transverse momentum behavior of               
              particle spectra, and (d) R&D for photon and electron detection                
              within the Phenix experiment.
