Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The PI proposes to make use of the facilities of the Radial                    
              Jet Reattachment Laboratory to perform exploratory studies on                  
              non-steady submerged radial jet impingement heat transfer.                     
              Prior studies by the PI on steady radial jet impingement                       
              resulted in very high heat transfer rates. Studies of non-                     
              steady non-radial jets by other investigators have                             
              demonstrated enhanced heat transfer performance. There is thus                 
              a good possibility that a non-steady radial jet may also offer                 
              enhanced heat transfer performance compared to conventional                    
              jets and steady radial jets.
