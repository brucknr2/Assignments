Abstract    :
              The Physical Chemistry Structure and Reactivity Program of the                 
              Chemistry Division is supporting research at Brigham Young                     
              University under the supervision of Professors Izatt and                       
              Oscarson on the calorimetric study of chemical reactions in the                
              water critical region.  The work involves measurements of heats                
              of reaction and dilution, with associated density measurements,                
              for ion association of alkali and alkaline earth hydroxides and                
              chlorides in near-critical water solutions.  Changes in the                    
              standard thermodynamic variables, free energy, enthalpy,                       
              entropy, and heat capacity are being evaluated.                                
              %%%                                                                            
              The chemical properties of solutions of simple salts and bases                 
              are very different at high temperatures and pressures than                     
              under ordinary conditions.  Izatt and Oscarson are engaged in                  
              thermodynamic measurements of such solutions to permit                         
              prediction of equilibria of importance in such applications as                 
              supercritical water oxidation of chemical wastes, geothermal                   
              wells, and steam generation.
