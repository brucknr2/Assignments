Abstract    :
              The purpose of this project is to analyze the consequences                     
              of presuming firms choose their plant size so that they can                    
              service their seasonal fluctuations in demand before they know                 
              whether overall annual demand will be high or low.  At issue, is               
              whether capacity precommitment results in firms seeking smoother               
              seasonal fluctuations in production during a boom.  In order to                
              examine this question, a model is developed and tested with                    
              seasonally unadjusted data in contrast to the usual approach of                
              utilizing adjusted data.  The findings will have a number of                   
              important implications.  Among other things, the fact that                     
              seasonal and cyclical fluctuations interact implies that standard              
              seasonal adjustment procedures typically used in most studies                  
              provide misleading results.  This implies, in turn, that attempts              
              to date business cycles using standard seasonally adjusted data                
              are likely to understate the length of expansions.  Furthermore,               
              the findings may have important implications for the  nature of                
              industry-level cycles.  This project will also analyze how well                
              small firms fared during historical episodes of financial unrest.
