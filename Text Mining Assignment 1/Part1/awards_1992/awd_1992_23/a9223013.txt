Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  An extremely important set of uncertainties in climate change             
              theories are those associated with cloud/radiative/thermodynamic/              
              dynamic interactions.  Among the most troublesome of these                     
              uncertainties are those associated with the nature of the large-               
              scale thermodynamics processes leading to the observed complex                 
              structure of clouds at any given location and time.  Currently,                
              climate models generally relate cloud fractions and liquid water               
              contents to local relative humidity or convection precipitation                
              rates.  The formulas used are based on the results of theory and a             
              few short-term detailed field experiments.  Analyses of global,                
              long-term observations are needed to verify these parameterizations            
              and to test their applicability to regions, seasons or climatic                
              eras, which were not directly sampled in the field experiments                 
                   This project will carry out such analyses with the best                   
              available regularly observed data.  These data will consist of                 
              satellite derived estimates of fractional cover of seven cloud                 
              'types' derived from the International Satellite Cloud Climatology             
              Project, thermodynamics and dynamics variables from the operational            
              analyses of the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather                       
              Forecasting and standard observations of precipitation form surface            
              measurements.  In addition to using the previously derived cloud               
              types, the PI will derive and utilize a new specification of cloud             
              fraction at standard pressure level. Variations of these parameters            
              for much of the globe over seasonal and interannual time scales                
              will be used to derive new and assess current interrelationships               
              used in the cloud parameterizations of climate and long-range                  
              forecast models.
