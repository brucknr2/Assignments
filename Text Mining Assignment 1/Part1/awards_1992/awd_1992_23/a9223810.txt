Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Although the plans for the National Research and Education                     
              Network (NREN) have evolved since 1988, they continue to revolve               
              around a decision for phased implementation that is embedded in                
              the larger framework of the High Performance Computing and                     
              Communications Program (HPCC).  The current phase, now referred                
              to as the Interagency Interim NREN, involves extending the reach               
              of the Internet network complex that includes the NSFNET                       
              Backbone, midlevels, campus networks that rely on the backbone                 
              for interconnection, and other federally sponsored networks, all               
              of which serve the research and education community.  It also                  
              involves enhancements to the range and quality of network-based                
              services.                                                                      
                                                                                             
              The National Academy's Computer Science and Telecommunications                 
              Board (CSTB) will revisit its earlier analysis since 1990 of key               
              policy and management issues.  It will produce a report following              
              4 to 5 meetings of its 15 member panel which will take testimony               
              from outside experts and other members of the Internet networking              
              community.***
