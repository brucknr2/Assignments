Abstract    :
              In April 1991, the University of Southern                                      
              California developed, organized and managed                                    
              the subsequent conference, COSU-II, held in                                    
              Long Beach, California with the same sponsors                                  
              as the COSU-I.  The experience with the COSU-                                  
              II conference was much the same as COSU-I:                                     
              150 delegates from 14 foreign countries and                                    
              the U.S. attended the meeting for three days                                   
              of discussions about new directions in                                         
              technology and policies for managing ocean                                     
              coasts.  In all, more than 30 papers were                                      
              presented at the conference and those papers                                   
              have been organized into a proceedings.  The                                   
              COSU-II conference is now successfully                                         
              completed and the USC Sea Grant Program is                                     
              now preparing the conference proceedings.                                      
              With a generous grant from the Max and                                         
              Victoria Dreyfus Foundation, we have been                                      
              able to have all of the papers entered into a                                  
              single computer file in preparation for                                        
              editing and publication.  This action                                          
              provides funds to complete publication of the                                  
              proceedings.
