              Ezequiel Zamora, in Venezuela, to discuss                                      
              recent progress and future directions in fish                                  
              ecology in Latin America. The workshop will                                    
              identify priority areas in fisheries management                                
              and conservation of aquatic natural resources;                                 
              evaluate existing methodologies in fish ecological                             
              research; and explore new means of transferring                                
              technology and expertise between institutions.                                 
                                                                                             
              This workshop will promote international                                       
              collaboration, especially in the neotropics.                                   
              It will address the need for surveys of                                        
              biological diversity and international                                         
              fisheries management, and for improved data                                    
              bases for dealing with increasingly stressed                                   
              natural resources.
