Abstract    :
              The Eighth Cambridge Workshop on Cool Stars will be held at the                
              University of Georgia in Athens on October 11 to 14, 1993.  The                
              topic of the workshop concerns the sun and similar stars.  Issues              
              to be addressed include angular momentum evolution, Lithium                    
              abundances, evolution of magnetic activity and  the fundamental                
              stellar properties of mass, age and position in the HR diagram.  An            
              unusual feature of this meeting is the plan to include other topics            
              suggested by attendees.  There will be a special session devoted to            
              results from recent space missions.
