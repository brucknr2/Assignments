Abstract    :
              The focus of this research is the use of enzymes in key steps                  
              of the synthesis of complex molecules.  The proposed substrates                
              for the enzymes are meso compounds readily available from the                  
              oxidation of simple cyclic hydrocarbons such as                                
              cyclopentadiene, benzene, cycloheptatriene, cycloheptene and                   
              1,5-cyclooctadiene.  The enzymatic reactions will serve to                     
              unveil multiple chiral centers. The resulting building blocks                  
              will be exposed to a number of synthetic protocols,including                   
              the use of transition metal-catalyzed coupling reactions, to                   
              give various classes of molecules of biological interest.

              With this Accomplishment Based Renewal award, the Synthetic                    
              Organic Program is supporting the research of Dr. Carl R.                      
              Johnson of the Department of Chemistry at Wayne State                          
              University.  Professor Johnson will focus his work on the                      
              application of enzymes as catalysts in key steps of the                        
              synthesis of complex organic molecules.
