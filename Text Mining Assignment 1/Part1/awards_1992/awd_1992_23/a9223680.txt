Abstract    :
              The National Information Service for Earthquake Engineering                    
              (NISEE) was established to facilitate the collection,                          
              organization, and dissemination of information related to                      
              earthquake engineering to various user groups including                        
              researchers, practicing engineers, educators, public officials,                
              and the general public.  There are presently two branches of                   
              NISEE; one located at Caltech and one located at U.C. Berkeley.                
              In addition to its national role, the Caltech Branch is a                      
              resource for the large and active community of earthquake                      
              engineering and seismic safety related specialists in the                      
              Southern California region.  The Branch has undertaken an                      
              initiative in the area of strong-motion studies.  A special                    
              Strong-Motion Center has been established to meet the growing                  
              needs of individuals involved in strong-motion data acquisition                
              and analysis and those in such fields as risk assessment, seismic              
              hazard determination, structural performance analysis, and code                
              development.  The Caltech Branch also has a library collection                 
              and resources that are useful to those in the areas of public                  
              policy and earthquake preparedness.
