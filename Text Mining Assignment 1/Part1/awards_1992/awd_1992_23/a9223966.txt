Abstract    :
              9223966  Russell    This award is to start a new Materials Research Group (MRG)
              at  Princeton University on the topic of microstructured  macromolecular soft
              materials.  The goal of the research is to  understand, control, and exploit
              these materials.  The research  addresses three major themes:  (1) block
              copolymers where the  meso-scale morphology is determined by block lengths and 
              thermodynamic incompatibilities of the constituents,   (2)  polymer-particle
              dispersions where the attachment of the block  copolymer at an interface leads
              to ordering in the colloidal  phase,  (3)  study of the properties of complex
              structured  fluids.  These three themes involve research on dynamics of 
              ordering, effects of shear on ordering, use of phase separated  systems as
              templates for nano-lithography, effects of block  copolymer structure on
              adsorption and ordering, tailoring of  fluid rheology through control of
              microstructure.    Microstructured soft materials order on the length scale of
              ten  to hundred nanometers, where structure formation or self assembly  occurs
              in the fluid state.  Structure formation is determined by  the balance among
              structural entropy, steric energy, and  electrostatic forces.  Examples of
              microstructured soft materials  include motor oils and lubricants, colloidal
              additives to  plastics, thermoplastic elastomers, paints and coatings, drilling
               fluids, nano-lithography for electronics, and nonlinear optics.  The research
              involves collaboration with Exxon Corporate Research  Laboratories.  The
              institutional environment at Princeton  University is excellent for training
              advanced students for  careers in research and teaching.  ***
