Abstract    :
              This  award  will support researchers at three institutions,  the              
              University  of  California at San Diego  (UCSD),  the  San  Diego              
              Supercomputer  Center (SDSC), and The Scripps Research  Institute              
              (TSRI),  to  develop, distribute, and maintain software  for  the              
              structural biology community.  The software will involve  aspects              
              of   both   molecular  modeling  and  visualization  (at   TSRI),              
              development  of  improved methods in crystallographic  refinement              
              (UCSD),  and  the documentation and support of the  software  (at              
              SDSC).
