Abstract    :
              Professor Reed of the University of Southern California will                   
              conduct studies on synthetic inorganic chemistry with funding                  
              from the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic program.                  
              He will investigate the coordination chemistry of weakly                       
              coordinating anions, such as BC11H12- and its derivatives.                     
              These anions should allow the preparation of highly-reactive                   
              cationic species, including the silicenium cation and                          
              transition-metal complexes of very weak donors, such as xenon                  
              and hydrocarbons.  He will also develop a "magnetochemical                     
              series", by investigating the nature of spin-admixed                           
              intermediate spin state somplexes of the type                                  
              Fe(III)Y(porphyrin).  A third area of investigation will be in                 
              fulleride chemistry, where he will examine species such as                     
              C60n-, C70n-, and BC59-.                                                       
              %%%                                                                            
              Research in synthetic inorganic chemistry presents many                        
              opportunities.  Professor Reed of USC will investigate several                 
              sub-areas, with a focus of large anions that have a very low                   
              tendency to bind to cations.  This property will allow unusual                 
              cations to be synthesized, cations that would normally be                      
              strongly bound to whatever anions were available.  Potential                   
              applications of such unusual cations would be in catalysis and                 
              the development of new reagents for synthesis of organic                       
              substances.  Additional studies will focus on new ways to                      
              describe the bonding between metal cations and other atomic                    
              groups.
