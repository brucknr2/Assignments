Abstract    :
              The growth of Government is the most dramatic, yet least                       
              understood, change in the American economy in the last century.                
              While most studies have focused on the growth of the federal                   
              government, state governments also expanded rapidly and often                  
              experimented with programs that were later introduced at the                   
              federal level.  The purpose of this research is to better                      
              understand the role of the states in the growth of government by               
              analyzing the adoption of workers' compensation, America's first               
              major social insurance program.  The research will combine both                
              macro analysis of the timing of adoption of workers' compensation              
              with detailed and quantitative case studies of the passage of the              
              laws in several important states.  The extent to which workers'                
              compensation benefitted or harmed various groups will be                       
              estimated, including workers of various skill levels, unionized                
              workers, employers of different sizes and different accident                   
              experience, insurance companies, taxpayers, and state officials.               
              Based on these empirical estimates, how groups and individuals                 
              translated their expected economic returns into political action               
              will be analyzed.  This research is important because it will                  
              provide a better understanding of the interaction of the economic              
              and political systems in the development of the American economy.
