Abstract    :
                   This proposal outlined a novel composite structure which                  
              consisted a ferroelectric core, such as BaTiO3, constrained by a               
              shell formed by dopant diffusion into the base material.  This                 
              insured a smooth transition of concentration gradient across the               
              core/shell interface, and it resulted in high internal stresses                
              accompanied by low fatigue and no cracking.  The former is a                   
              distinct advantage and the latter two are disadvantages in sensing             
              and actuator applications.  This proposal aims to investigate the              
              core/shell structures and to develop a basic understanding of the              
              mechanisms for its formation.  This study will also investigate the            
              electrical and mechanical response characteristics of these                    
              core/shell composite structures.

                   This proposal aims to investigate the mechanisms for the                  
              optimum formation of the core/shell type of composite structures,              
              and to explore their potential applications in sensing and actuator            
              applications.  They are the Smart Materials types of applications.             
              They have the potentials to contribute significantly to the                    
              intelligent processing in manufacturing.
