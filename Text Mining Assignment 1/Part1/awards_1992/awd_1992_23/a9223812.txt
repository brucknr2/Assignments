Abstract    :
              Dubois         A testbed for experimenting with memory hierarchies in 
              multiprocessors is being supported.  A processor node in the  testbed contains
              cache and memory system controllers made from  field-programmable gate arrays. 
              To experiment with a memory  control mechanism or coherency technique, the
              investigators  program the gate arrays to implement the mechanism.  For
              software  support of experimental techniques, the GNU-C compiler is being 
              modified to generate appropriate code, such as non-blocking  prefetches, and
              the Mach microkernel is being ported to provide  thread scheduling.
