              Texas A&M University requests funding to purchase shipboard                    
              instrumentation.  The instruments will be used aboard the R/V GYRE,            
              a 182 foot vessel, which is owned and operated by the University.              
              The PI requested funding to purchase a variety of instruments to               
              provide adequate support for NSF-funded scientific research that is            
              scheduled aboard the GYRE in 1993.
