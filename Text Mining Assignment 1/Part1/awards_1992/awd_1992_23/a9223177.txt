Abstract    :
                   Driver will study differential and integral calculus on path              
              and loop spaces of compact Riemannian manifolds.  The long term                
              goal is to develop Malliavin calculus, Hodge and index type                    
              theorems for Wiener spaces of paths and loops on curved                        
              manifolds.  The specific problems include constructing path and                
              loop space valued Brownian motions by stochastic development                   
              using two-parameter stochastic calculus, and investigating the                 
              existence of log-Sobolev inequalities for different path and loop              
              space measures.                                                                
                   The project involves loop spaces. In the special case of                  
              two dimensional manifold, the loop space is just the family of                 
              all continuous closed paths on a surface which start at some                   
              fixed point.  One key idea is to construct a measure on these                  
              paths so that one can talk about the "volume" of a set of paths                
              and thus integrate over the loop space.  This is important for                 
              understanding the topology of loop spaces and has implications                 
              for string theory in physics.
