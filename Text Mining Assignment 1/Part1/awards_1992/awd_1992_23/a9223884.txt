Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The NSF-owned Research Vessel ENDEAVOR, operated under a charter               
              party agreement by the University of Rhode Island, has operated                
              continuously for 16 years.  The average projected life of a                    
              research vessel is 30 years.  This project will make major                     
              modifications and upgrades to the vessel to prepare her for the                
              second half of her operational life.                                           
                                                                                             
              The viability of an oceanographic research vessel to conduct the               
              changing needs of ocean science research diminishes with time.  The            
              modifications and upgrades will modernize the ENDEAVOR and equip               
              her to be as effective and reliable as when she was originally                 
              delivered for service in 1976.                                                 
                                                                                             
              The improvements focus on three major areas.  Improvements to                  
              increase and enhance the ability of the ship to conduct ocean                  
              science research; upgrades to improve the day to day operation and             
              maintainability of the ship; and refinements to improve the                    
              habitability of the ship.  Attention to all these areas will result            
              in a vessel well equipped to continue a long standing tradition of             
              good service to the community of ocean science research.
