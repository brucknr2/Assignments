Abstract    :
              In this Research in Undergraduate Institutions (RUI) project in                
              the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program of the Chemistry                   
              Division, Thomas A. Stephenson of Swarthmore College will study                
              the photo-induced dynamics of the van der Waals cluster NeBr2                  
              and of the ion-pair states of I2.  Specifically, the                           
              vibrational predissociation dynamics of NeBr2 produced in a                    
              supersonic free jet expansion will be examined via fluorescence                
              induced by a probe laser to test model predictions and to                      
              explore the effect of different electronic states.  In the I2                  
              studies the effect of electronic excitation on rotational and                  
              vibrational energy transfer probabilities and pathways will be                 
              studied in single-collision state-to-state collision dynamics                  
              experiments.                                                                   
              %%%                                                                            
              A crucial component in developing a comprehensive framework for                
              understanding chemical reactions is to elucidate the forces                    
              involved as two atoms or molecules interact during collisions.                 
              The studies undertaken here on atom-diatom systems are simple                  
              enough that they can be understood and modeled theoretically,                  
              thus providing the groundwork for understanding more complex                   
              systems.  Such knowledge is crucial for understanding all sorts                
              of gas-phase dynamical processes, such as atmospheric                          
              reactions, combustion, and even the synthesis of materials by                  
              chemical vapor deposition.
