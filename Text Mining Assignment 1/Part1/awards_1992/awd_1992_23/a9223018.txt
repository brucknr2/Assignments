Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Since the Late 1950s, the Latin American Church has undergone                  
              radical changes in terms of theology and pastoral organization.                
              Innovations such as liberation theology and comunidades eclesiales             
              de base (CEBs) have tended to reinvigorate the political role the              
              Church plays in society.  Moreover, in several authoritarian                   
              regimes, the Catholic Church as been the sole source of opposition.            
              Nevertheless, this change has not been uniform across Latin                    
              America.  Several national episcopates supported authoritarian rule            
              in the 1960s and 1970s.  This doctoral dissertation research                   
              investigation examines the role of religious competition (between              
              Catholics and non-Catholics) in determining whether the national               
              Church hierarchy endorses or opposes dictatorial rule.  The                    
              dissertation student investigates whether increasing presence of               
              Protestant sects in some countries has forced the episcopate to                
              adopt membership-retention strategies that are antithetical to the             
              military's goal of suppressing subversive organizations.                       
              Furthermore, conflict between the Church and military regime is                
              assessed concerning whether Church access to state patronage was               
              reduced during the early part of the century.  The student will                
              combine historical research with field research (interviews with               
              church leaders) in Chile to examine this topic.
