Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Flowering plants limit self-fertilization and maintain genetic                 
              diversity by a number of mechanisms, ranging from simple physical              
              barriers to complex interactions between components of the pistil              
              and pollen.  In plants that posses self-incompatibility systems,               
              self-pollen is distinguished from pollen of genetically unrelated              
              origin in the stigma or style of the pistil.  Following the                    
              recognition of the presence of self-pollen, the development of                 
              self-related pollen grains, but not of genetically-distinct grains,            
              s halted.                                                                      
                                                                                             
              Although the mechanism of self-recognition is not yet known, a                 
              chromosomal location, the S locus, has been shown from genetic                 
              crosses to encode the putative pistil and pollen elements that                 
              interact in this recognition process.  This research will                      
              determine: whether a specific  region of these genes is a" master              
              switch" which confers specific expressed in the sigma and style of             
              the flower, whether specific DNA binding proteins regulate these               
              genes, and which pollen products interact with proteins coded for              
              by these genes.
