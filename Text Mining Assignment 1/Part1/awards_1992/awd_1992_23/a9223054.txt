Abstract    :
              This research project addresses the magneto-optic response of ZnSe-            
              based quantum well structures incorporating diluted magnetic                   
              semiconductor (DMS) layers such as ZnFeSe or ZnMnSe.  DMS-based                
              heterostructures are unique among semiconductor quantum wells in               
              that the band offsets between layers can be tuned continuously via             
              the application of an external magnetic field.  The project also               
              involves the preparation an study of new magnetic alloys based on              
              zinc, manganese, iron and selenium.  The materials can be viewed as            
              two phases, one being a Brillouin paramagnet, the other being a Van            
              Vleck paramagnet.  The two phases lead to novel magnetic behavior              
              which can be tuned by varying temperature and the external magnetic            
              field.

              This research project involves the synthesis and characterization              
              of new semiconducting materials which are also magnetic.  These                
              unusual materials have optical properties that vary when they are              
              placed in a magnetic field.  These properties offer promise in                 
              microwave and information storage technologies.
