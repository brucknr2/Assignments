Abstract    :
                   A graphics computing facility including an FDDI interface,                
              high-resolution color graphics monitor and framebuffer,                        
              stereoscopic viewing glasses, and 3D interface equipment shall be              
              acquired to support research efforts in computer and information               
              science and engineering.                                                       
                                                                                             
              This, and AVS scientific visualization software will be used for               
              rendering, visualization, and animation research projects in                   
              mathematics, physics, virtual reality, scientific computation,                 
              discrete and combinatorial structures, and parallel program                    
              performance.
