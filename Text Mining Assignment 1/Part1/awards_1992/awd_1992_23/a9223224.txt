Abstract    :
              The Theoretical and Computational Chemistry Program of the                     
              Chemistry Division is supporting research at the University of                 
              Illinois at Urbana/Champaign under the supervision of Professor                
              Peter G. Wolynes on nonequilibrium statistical mechanics.  The                 
              work involves studies of (1) the quantum dynamics of complex                   
              systems, and (2) chemical kinetics in biomolecular and solvent                 
              environments.  The unifying theme of the work is the                           
              exploitation of ideas from random system physics to study                      
              problems in chemical physics.

              The application of statistical methods to study the physical                   
              behavior of systems containing many particles at equilibrium is                
              well developed, but similar application to nonequilibrium                      
              systems such as those undergoing chemical reaction is a major                  
              current frontier of physical chemistry.  Professor Wolynes is                  
              developing statistical techniques to obtain useful information                 
              about such reacting systems, particularly those undergoing                     
              biological transformations or those interacting with solvents                  
              in solution reactions.
