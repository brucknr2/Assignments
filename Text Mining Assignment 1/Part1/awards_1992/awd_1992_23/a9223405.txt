Abstract    :
                9223405  Ullman    Research into Database System Theory    This is the first
              year of a three-year continuing award.  High-  level algebraic or logical query
              languages have been shown to be  extremely useful in modern database systems,
              and there is a need to  extend their scope.  These sorts of languages allow
              database  programs to be written clearly, quickly, and accurately.  However, 
              they make it harder for the database system to find an efficient  method to
              answer queries or to implement constraints.  Logically  expressed constraints
              are an important feature of distributed  database systems, especially when used
              for collaboration or  integration of separate databases.  Methods for checking 
              constraints as the connected databases change is especially  important; goals
              are to check for constraint violations as locally  and efficiently as possible.
               Logical languages frequently involve  negation in rules, or nonmonotonic
              reasoning, where providing more  information at one level allows one to infer
              less at another level.   Efficient and general ways to find intuitively correct
               interpretations of logic with negation are being sought.  Finally,  the use of
              algebra or logic as a query language requires the  optimization of expressions
              involving the join of many relations.   Efficient ways to find good orders of
              joining are being studied.   If successful, large-scale database systems will
              become easier to  use and will be capable of performing operations such as 
              distributed constraint maintenance that they are not able to do  with adequate
              efficiency today.  ***
