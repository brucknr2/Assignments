Abstract    :
              Trends and volatility in primary commodity prices present policy               
              makers in developing countries with problems of both                           
              macroeconomic and microeconomic management, problems that will                 
              not be resolved until there exists a coherent and empirically                  
              supported theory of the determination of the prices of primary                 
              commodities.  The leading theoretical explanation of agricultural              
              crop prices rests on a combination of supply and demand together               
              with storage and profit-maximizing speculators.  This story is                 
              consistent with several stylized facts, but formal empirical                   
              analysis has only become possible with recent advances in the                  
              econometric analysis of nonlinear dynamic programs. Results have               
              been less than encouraging, at least for simple versions of the                
              theory.  This research builds on previous analysis by the                      
              investigators and will enrich the basic model to the point where               
              it is either consistent with the evidence, or is clearly                       
              rejected.  The theory will be extended to accommodate growth in                
              output, more complex supply patterns, and the flow of information              
              between crop years.  Empirical work will extend pervious analysis              
              to higher frequency data and will use extensive historical data                
              on production, stocks, and future markets to test fuller versions              
              of the theory.
