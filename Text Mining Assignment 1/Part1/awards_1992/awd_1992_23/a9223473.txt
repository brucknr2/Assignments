Abstract    :
              The prehistory of the Aleutian Islands is poorly known and there is            
              little understanding of the development of cultural complexity in              
              this region. This archaeological investigation involves the                    
              excavation and analysis of structures and middens in the Shumagin              
              Islands. The project is designed to determine how many of the                  
              structures were occupied simultaneously and what variation exists              
              in larger and smaller structures. In addition to determining the               
              distributions of implements and prestige goods, the excavations                
              will render food remains indicative of diet. Combined with this new            
              information, overall patterns of site densities in the Aleutians               
              will enable estimates of prehistoric Aleutian populations.
