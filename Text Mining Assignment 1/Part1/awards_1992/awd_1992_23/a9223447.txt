Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  This is a study of the intellectual and social structure of               
              three sciences: sociology, economics, and political science.  It               
              will analyze membership statistics and similar data from the                   
              professional organizations of these fields.  First, this study will            
              chart the structures of these disciplines, using social network                
              analysis, multidimensional scaling and cluster analysis.  Then it              
              will compare structures across disciplines.  Finally, it will                  
              attempt to explain the patterns in terms of the factors that                   
              generate and reproduce them.                                                   
                                                                                             
                   This study will help social scientists in the three                       
              disciplines understand the intellectual structures of their own                
              fields.  The data will be a valuable resource for educators,                   
              guiding college curriculum design and providing a useful framework             
              for long-range planning in academic institutions.  The study will              
              also contribute insights for the sociology of science, through the             
              conceptual maps it generates of sociology, economics, and political            
              science.
