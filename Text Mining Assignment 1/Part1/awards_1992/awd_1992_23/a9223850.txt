Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              High frequency electrodynamic measurements are used as sensitive               
              probes of the Meissner and mixed states of superconductors.                    
              Measurements of the surface resistance and penetration depth at                
              several frequencies in the MHz and GHz ranges will be carried out              
              as a function of temperature and magnetic field. The results will              
              be analyzed to extract information regarding the dynamics of the               
              condensate, quasiparticles and vortices, and will be compared with             
              fundamental models. The materials which will be studied are several            
              of the high and low Tc superconductors. The vortices will be                   
              paramaterized and the resulting measurements will be used to test              
              theories of vortex formation, melting, vortex glass, and other                 
              thermodynamic states                                                           
              %%%                                                                            
              This project explores the response of high temperature                         
              superconductors to alternating electric and magnetic fields. The               
              results are expected to be important for both fundamental                      
              understanding and for applications of superconducting devices at               
              high frequencies.
