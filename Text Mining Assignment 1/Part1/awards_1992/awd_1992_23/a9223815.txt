              and problems with engineering and management faculty; (2) improve              
              the relevance and realism of academic research and education; and              
              (3) present recent progress and state-of-the-art planning models               
              and solution techniques for a variety of significant industrial                
              problems.  Speakers at this event will include individuals that are            
              well- known contributors to the main theme of the workshop, equally
