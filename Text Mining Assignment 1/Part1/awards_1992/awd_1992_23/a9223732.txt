Abstract    :
              Chien         The selection of good routing algorithms in multicomputer 
              networks is necessary to prevent deadlock, avoid hot spots, and  maximize
              performance.  This project establishes a framework for  selecting routing
              algorithms, which consists of four parts:  1.     selection of deadlock-free
              algorithms with varying degrees  of adaptiveness;  2.     a set of analytic
              models of router speeds based on switch  and buffer delay measurements;  3.    
              an empirical study of network traffic patterns to determine  the need for
              adaptiveness in routing; and  4.     a set of techniques for extending routers
              to meet  requirements such as fault tolerance and in-order message  delivery.
