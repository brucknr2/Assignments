Abstract    :
              Dr. Hirsh is examining the creation of a new consensus emerging                
              between electric utilities and consumers that results in increased             
              energy efficiency, lower customer costs, greater corporate profits,            
              and enhanced environmental quality.  In contrast to the acrimonious            
              relationship between utilities and customers that existed in the               
              1970's, the new "social contract" has at its core the increasing               
              sophistication of so-called "demand-side management" (DSM)                     
              technologies.  A catch-all phrase that subsumes conservation                   
              measures and high-efficiency, end-use technologies, demand-side                
              management curbs customer requirements for electricity and reduces             
              the need for utilities to construct power plants, with all the                 
              attendant environmental savings.  In a novel fashion that promises             
              universal rewards, activist groups, utilities, and other players in            
              the late 1980's seized upon DSM technologies to reach a new                    
              consensus.                                                                     
                                                                                             
              Dr. Hirsh's study is focusing on technological, regulatory,                    
              political, and managerial events that have coalesced to create a               
              new social contract within the utility community.  Employing oral              
              history and documentary sources, his work extends research that                
              deals with the restructuring of the utility industry that resulted             
              from technological and regulatory innovations in the 1970's and                
              1980's.  Dr. Hirsh's goal is to interpret the utility industry's               
              transformation since the 1970's as the result of a process in which            
              various players negotiated their contractual roles and                         
              responsibilities.  The study promises to become not just a history             
              of these events but a useful planning tool for policy makers and               
              utility managers.
