Abstract    :
              This is the first year of a three-year continuing award.  The                  
              research aims to develop a principled methodology with which to                
              specify motions of an active observer, commonly referred to as the             
              "next look" problem.  The work will provide algorithms and                     
              techniques that can be used in mobile robot systems to control the             
              robot's motion and to efficiently acquire sensory information about            
              the robot's environment.  The work consists of three primary areas             
              of research. The first involves the development, and implementation            
              in a real-time robotic system, of active vision algorithms for                 
              extraction of 3D environmental information. This includes structure            
              from controlled camera motion, and structure from controlled                   
              illuminant motion.  The second aspect of the work involves the                 
              development of a Bayesian data integration technique which will                
              allow the 3D information acquired by multiple active vision modules            
              over time to be integrated into a dynamic world or robot                       
              environment map.  The third aspect is the development of a                     
              methodology for determining optimal and sub-optimal trajectories of            
              active observers, based on the criteria of minimizing the time and             
              computation required to reduce a global measure of uncertainty to              
              below a set threshold.
