Abstract    :
               Process algebras are a basic tool in the theory of concurrency:  a 
              mathematical model simple enough to analyze and understand, yet  complex 
              enough to illustrate many of the subtleties and problems  of concurrency.  They
               have been used for theory, programming  language design, and specification and
               verification languages.  For sequential languages, a few models of 
              computation  suffice.  However, there are a variety of forms of  concurrency,
              and hence a variety of process algebras.  It if  therefore  essential to: (1)
              understand the connections between the many schools of  process algebra, (2)
              have theoretical and computer tools for designing and  analyzing process
              algebras, and (3) understand commonalties and metatheory of  process  algebra,
              to avoid unnecessarily repeating the same work  in many  settings.    A general
              framework for investigating process algebras in terms  of  their structured
              operational semantics (SOS) is formulated  and a surprising   connection
              between SOS and  equational definitions  established.  In particular,
              operations that respect the most commonly-used   process  equivalences are
              axiomatizable from their SOS  specifications.  It is believed that this
              connection is theoretically fundamental and of   substantial practical value to
              researchers.  An elaboration of this paradigm   should unify two major
              communities in process algebra, and provide valuable   tools to researchers in 
              concurrency.
