              P#   92 Fox  Many scientists interested in evolution are aware that when
              mixtures of amino acids are heated they polymerize to thermal proteins which,
              in turn, self-assemble in the presence of water to form cell-like structures
              called thermal protein (TP) microspheres.  These TP microspheres behave in many
              ways like true neurons; they display membrane potentials, generate action
              potential-like electrical discharges in response to light, form junctions, and
              extend axon-like outgrowths.  Thus, TP microspheres can be c onsidered
              "protoneurons:, the scientific study of which may help to elucidate which basic
              properties of modern day neurons are ingerent to these protocells that assemble
              in a nonrandom way under conditions believed to have existed on the primitive
              Earth.  In the proposed research, the chemical, electrical, and possible
              psychological microspheres will be studied.  The electrophysiological responses
              to light will be quantified and possible ion channel-like characteristics of
              their membranes explored.  Finally, whether any relatively permanant change in
              the behavior of TP microspheres can be induced by experience will be explored. 
              This will be determined by testing interconnected networks of TP microspheres
              for basic learning processes known to occur in both vertebrate and invertebrate
              species, as well as in single-cell eukaryotic organisms.  The basic learning
              processes to be investigated include habituation, sensitization, and possible
              associative changes which might occur in TP microspheres electrical response to
              light, as a result of experience. ***
