Abstract    :
              This award is for support of a project to study the processes of               
              debris entrainment at the base of the Matanuska Glacier.                       
              Conventional theories of sediment entrainment rely on pressure-                
              induced melting and refreezing around obstacles at the glacier                 
              sole.  Evidence from preliminary work around the glacier, however,             
              suggest that ice and sediment is underplated to the glacier base by            
              a process of net freeze-on.  Theoretical calculations for water                
              flow in subglacial conduits indicate that conditions necessary for             
              freezing can only exist where water flows uphill out of an                     
              overdeepening.   A better understanding of this process will shed              
              light on the factors controlling glacier movement and till genesis.
