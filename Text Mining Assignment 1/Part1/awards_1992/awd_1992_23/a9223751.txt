Abstract    :
              9223751  Purnell    This Americas Program award will partially support a  series
              of international workshops on science,  scientific thought and science
              teaching, to take place  in Lima, Peru, July 30-August 10, 1993.  The U.S. 
              organizers are Dr. Frederick Purnell and Professor  Alberto Cordero, both of
              Queens College, City  University of New York (CUNY).  The Peruvian organizer 
              is Professor Francisco Miro-Quesada, Director of the  Institute for
              Philosophical Investigations, Lima  University (IDIF), in association with the
              National  Council for Science and Technology of Peru.  The  principal goal of
              the project is to improve scientific  thought and science education in Peru.   
              The first part of the program will provide advanced  college undergraduates and
              high school teachers with  an overview of recent foundational developments in 
              science, with emphasis on the growing integration of  separate disciplines and
              the methods and standards of  inquiry employed in today's natural sciences. 
              The workshops are designed to bring together Peruvian  scientists, faculty, and
              scholars, with scientists  from the international community, for discussions on
               how to improve the teaching and content of general  courses in the natural
              sciences and mathematics at the  college level.  The program also aims to
              promote  research cooperation between Peruvian and other Latin  America
              countries and the international participants.
