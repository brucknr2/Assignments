Abstract    :
              The purpose of this conference, to be held March 17-18, 1993 at                
              MIT, is to bring together engineers, scientists, mathematicians                
              and computer scientists, active in the developing world of                     
              discrete elements, to present their work, discuss relevant                     
              issues and document the current state of Discrete Element                      
              Method (DEM) technology. The  DEM offers a complimentary                       
              approach to solving complex engineering problems                               
              occurring in  many fields and offers                                           
              a methodology unavailable in classical continuum analyses.
