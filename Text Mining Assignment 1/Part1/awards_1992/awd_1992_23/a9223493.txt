Abstract    :
              This award is for support of a glacial geologic, stratigraphic,                
              and geochronologic study of the limits and timing of Late                      
              Weichselian/Holocene glacial and deglacial events on Franz Josef               
              Land, Russia.  High resolution satellite imagery will be used to               
              identify study areas; radiocarbon dating of subfossils included                
              in raised beaches of known elevation will provide information on               
              the timing and rate of glacial-isostatic uplift; stratigraphic                 
              and sedimentological studies of glacial deposits will provide                  
              information on provenance; and integration of field data with                  
              isostatic and glaciological modeling will provide insight into                 
              glacial thickness, position of ice divides, domes, and streams                 
              and possible response to sea-level rise.  This study will provide              
              new data on Holocene and Late Weichselian glacial geometry in the              
              Russian Arctic where little data currently exists.
