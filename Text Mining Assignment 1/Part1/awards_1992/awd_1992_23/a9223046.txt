Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  This research examines why traditional Islamic schools                    
              (pensantren) are flourishing rather than declining in the                      
              face of national development efforts in West Java,                             
              Indonesia.  The project will test the hypothesis that                          
              traditional religions in Southeast Asia can both maintain                      
              their strength and promote development in the modern                           
              context.  It will also seek to determine what historical,                      
              economic, political, and socio-cultural factors account for                    
              the pensantren's ability to grow and address development                       
              issues without losing their religious distinctiveness.  The                    
              researcher hypothesizes that it is the flexibility of the                      
              Sufistic conceptual framework of traditional Islam, coupled                    
              with the centrality of the pensantren historically to                          
              Javanese village life, that has enabled the pensantren to                      
              adapt economic development goals to rural Javanese                             
              realities.  The project will provide important data on the                     
              role of religion in economic development.
