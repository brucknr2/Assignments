Abstract    :
              9223482  Todd  A significant commercial opportunity lies in providing  software
              systems which take real world engineering problems,  expressed in engineering
              rather than mathematical terms, and  convert these problems into systems of
              mathematical equations.  These equations may then be analyzed using the
              symbolic and  numerical facilities of a general purpose mathematics package. 
              This approach separates application specific engineering  knowledge from the
              application independent capabilities of  general purpose mathematical software.
               In the last four  years, Variational Geometry has emerged as a natural and 
              powerful language for the expression of mechanical engineering  problems;
              particularly, problems in the realm of engineering  mechanics.  The opportunity
              to be addressed by this project is  to develop an engineering mechanics package
              which will serve  to convert a variational geometry based description of the 
              engineering problem into a symbolic mathematical description,  which may then
              be analyzed inside a general purpose  mathematical package.  The Phase II
              research will develop a  prototype system capable of accepting an engineering
              problem  phrased in terms of Variational Geometry and outputting a  symbolic
              mathematics description of the problem.  ***
