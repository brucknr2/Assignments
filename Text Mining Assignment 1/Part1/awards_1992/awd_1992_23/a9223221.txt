Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  This is a study of the impact of local area characteristics on            
              the aspirations and attainments of individuals.  It will                       
              investigate the spatial organization of labor market structures,               
              attaching data on the geographical unit to the National                        
              Longitudinal Survey of Youth.  Economic and sociological models of             
              attainment, mobility, and career processes will be expanded to                 
              include the place of work, and the mechanisms explaining the role              
              of local effects will be studied using multilevel analytic                     
              techniques.  Two major attributes of local area are hypothesized to            
              have impact on status attainment: the opportunity structure, and               
              the local cultural milieu.                                                     
                                                                                             
                   This study brings together two influential research                       
              traditions, by examining both how individuals attain occupational              
              status and how labor markets shape job opportunities.  It will                 
              contribute to the knowledge base for policy decisions concerning               
              the American system of employment, and it will improve social-                 
              scientific understanding of social processes that shape local                  
              economies.
