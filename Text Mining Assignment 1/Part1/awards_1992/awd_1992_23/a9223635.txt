Abstract    :
              The objective of this interlaboratory testing program is to                    
              use twelve of the most common ASTM geotechnical standards                      
              and involve an estimated twenty voluntary laboratories                         
              distributed across the United States to develop four                           
              standard reference soils. The test results will be used to                     
              develop reliable precision statements for the selected                         
              standards which will be submitted for consideration to                         
              the appropriate technical subcommittee for inclusion in                        
              each standard. Four soils, which represent a wide range of                     
              typical deposits, will be used for the program. Large                          
              quantities of each soil will be processed to provide                           
              sufficient material for possible retesting and establish a                     
              stockpile for commercial use. At the conclusion of the                         
              research, these stock piled soils will be standard reference                   
              soils for the twelve standards. These soils will be available                  
              through ASTM Institute of Standards Research (ISR) for                         
              quality assurance and quality control programs, research                       
              applications  and education and training.
