Abstract    :
              9223656  Jafvert  This is an award to support research, the  objective of which
              is to determine the  aqueous concentrations of select hydrophobic  organic
              compounds, solubility of is enhanced  by the presence of specific co-solutes of
               intermediate molecular weight.  Research is  expected to elucidate the
              mechanisms of  enhancement and lead to an assessment of the  environmental
              impact this characteristic has  on the mobility and fate of the hydrophobic 
              compounds selected for study.  The  investigator plans on using fluorescence 
              quenching methods in his research to infer  mechanistic information at and
              below the  solubility limits for the selected  hydrophobic organic compounds. 
              He expects to  formulate mechanistic and semi-empirical  models that
              characterize the processes  leading to solubility, determine the  constants
              associated with these models and  evaluate the quality of the models by 
              conducting laboratory experiments.    Results of this work are expected to
              increase  our understanding of processes that control  the movement and fate of
              a class of organic  chemicals of limited solubility in water when  they are
              subjected to environmental  conditions that enhance their solubility.   This
              enhanced understanding may be applied to  assessing and modeling the impacts of
               hydrophobic hazardous chemicals contained in  aquatic sediments as a step
              design of  physical, chemical and biological remediation  processes.
