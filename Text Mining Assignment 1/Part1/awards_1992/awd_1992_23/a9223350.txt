Abstract    :
                9223350  Karp    Molecular biology databases will be of greater utility to 
              biomedical researchers when interconnected than in their current  isolated
              state. The primary impact of the meeting will be to  stimulate
              interdisciplinary research projects between computer  scientists who work in
              the area of integrating heterogeneous  databases, and bioinformatics
              researchers who develop and use  molecular biology databases.  Computer
              scientists at the workshop  are learning about the properties of existing
              databases and the  requirements that bioinformatics researchers will have for 
              interconnection.  Bioinformatics researchers at the workshop are  being exposed
              to strategies and technologies for interconnection  that have been developed by
              computer science researchers.  A second  focus of the workshop is to conduct an
              experiment toward the  development of a global, multi-database schema for
              several existing  molecular biology databases.  A global schema is a first step
               toward interconnecting these databases, and is a valuable exercise  for
              learning about and evaluating existing tools for the management  of database
              schemas.  A final report will summarize the results of  the workshop
              presentations and multidatabase schema experiment, and  will be distributed to
              members of the database and bioinformatics  communities.  ***
