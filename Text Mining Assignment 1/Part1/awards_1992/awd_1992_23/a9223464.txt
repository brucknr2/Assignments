Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT -- CTS-92-23464  PI -- Bankoff    The appearance of dry or nearly dry
              regions on a heated surface is important to many engineering technologies
              utilizing boiling or evaporative heat transfer. Previous work by the PI's has
              demonstrated new mechanisms, involving thermocapillary and recoil effects, for
              precursor formation. It is proposed to extend these studies by incorporating
              Van der Waals effects. These studies will involve numerical calculations for
              the advance of contact lines on the heated surface, including the formation of
              revulets in the wetting of initially dry surfaces, as well as experimental
              measurements of local film thicknesses.
