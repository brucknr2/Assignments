Abstract    :
              Dr. Shrinivas Kulkarni is receiving the Alan T. Waterman award for             
              his work on pulsars, the interstellar medium and astronomical                  
              instrumentation.  He was co-discoverer of the first known                      
              millisecond pulsar.  His research group has carried out surveys to             
              discover pulsars in globular clusters and is responsible for about             
              1/3 of the known examples.  He has also investigated many                      
              individual pulsars.  This work has included the detection of x-                
              ray emission from a millisecond pulsar and the discovery of one of             
              the oldest known examples of a pulsar associated with a supernova              
              remnant.  He showed that a peculiar radio source was a supernova               
              remnant with a pulsar embedded in its rim.  This implies that                  
              supernova explosion was highly asymmetric and ejected the resulting            
              neutron star at high velocity.  His studies of the interstellar                
              medium have demonstrated the existence of a magneto-ionic disk in              
              the galaxy which extends out to 25 kpc while providing the first               
              high-resolution images in the 3-mm line of CO for another galaxy,              
              M 51.  In the area of instrumentation he developed a pulsar timing             
              instrument with a wide band width and fast signal processor.  This             
              device permits the detection of fainter and shorter period pulsars             
              than had been possible previously.  He has developed an optical                
              interferometer which can produce diffraction limited images of                 
              stars.  Observations of the long period variable star Mira with the            
              200 inch telescope at Mt. Palomar Observatory showed that the star             
              is not round and is, thus, likely to be undergoing non-radial                  
              oscillations.  He is currently carrying out studies of optical                 
              interferometry aimed at combining those techniques with                        
              developments in adaptive optics.
