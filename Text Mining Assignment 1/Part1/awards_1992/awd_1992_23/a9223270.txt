Abstract    :
              Dr. Bird is organizing a one and one-half day conference/workshop              
              to be held in conjunction with the annual meeting of the American              
              Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS) in February 1993             
              in Boston Massachusetts.  The aim of the program is to assist                  
              educators and administrators in the development of undergraduate               
              and graduate level programs that address the wide range of ethical             
              concerns associated with professions in the sciences and                       
              engineering.  The workshop consists of lectures, symposia,                     
              discussion groups, demonstrations  wand worships designed to                   
              provide educators with theoretical foundations and practical tools             
              for addressing issues of professional ethics.  The sessions                    
              identify the ethical concerns of science professionals in a wide               
              range of sciences including the physical, biological, social and               
              information sciences and engineering.  Sessions are also to                    
              facilitate discussion within and across disciplines, and provide               
              the opportunity both to clarify issues and to learn about teaching             
              strategies, techniques and tools that have been developed.
