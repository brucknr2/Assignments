Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The goal of this research is synthesize and measure properties of              
              high temperature superconductors.  In general, it is proposed to               
              extend previous copper-oxide studies to more complex systems and               
              investigate whether a reduced Madelung energy allows for a cross-              
              over from more ionic to covalent bonding in the superconducting                
              phase of the n-type superconductors.  Specifically, eight topics               
              associated with narrow-band phenomena in solids are addressed:  1)             
              the transition from a superconductor to a conventional metal; 2)               
              the critical feature of high temperature superconductivity in n-               
              type superconductors; 3) measurements of frequency of charge                   
              fluctuation in systems below 150 K; 4) use of low-temperature                  
              synthetic procedures to make metal oxides with unusual valence                 
              states; 5) study of narrow-band phenomena in vanadium oxides; 6)               
              investigation of low-spin vs. high-spin configurations in cobalt               
              compounds; 7) examination of overlapping redox potentials in                   
              solids; and 8) exploration of variation of properties of                       
              monochalcogenides and pnictides due to the placement of redox                  
              couples with respect to the valence-bond edge.  The ultimate aim is            
              to pin point what is the essential confluence of properties that               
              makes possible the high temperature phenomenon.                                
                                                                                             
              There is no consensus as to the mechanism responsible for high-                
              temperature superconductivity in copper oxides, even six years                 
              after the discovery of the phenomenon.  This proposal addresses                
              this issue on a relatively broad front by bringing together                    
              experimental techniques and conceptual thinking from both chemistry            
              and physics.  In general, it is proposed to extend previous copper-            
              oxide studies to more complex systems.  Materials exhibiting                   
              narrow-band phenomena are prepared and characterized, and eight                
              topics are addressed to pin point what is the essential confluence             
              of properties that makes possible the high temperature phenomenon.
