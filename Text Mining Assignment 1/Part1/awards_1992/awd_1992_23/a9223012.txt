Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Paleoecological reconstructions at archaeological sites are                    
              important for understanding the environmental forcing mechanisms               
              behind human expansion into various environments, and subsequent               
              adaptation strategies.  Fossil ostrich eggshell is often associated            
              with human occupational levels in semiarid and arid regions of the             
              Old World, and is a new material from which paleoecologic data can             
              be extracted.                                                                  
                                                                                             
              This study will examine the isotopic relationships among the                   
              various components of ostrich eggshell, food and water under                   
              controlled conditions, and will examine the isotope composition of             
              fossil eggshell from sites in southern Egypt and South Africa,                 
              where the paleoecology has been assessed independently of the                  
              isotopic record.  It will be important in assessing the utility of             
              this new technique, as well as training doctoral candidates in new             
              techniques.
