Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  This proposal describes plans to fabricate and test a buoy                
              mounted radar (915 MHz) wind profiler for remote sensing of the                
              marine boundary layer.  During Phase I the PIs solved a variety of             
              technical challenges, including the development of two algorithms              
              to compensate the radar for buoy motion; development of a novel                
              antenna design to achieve multiple beams and low sidelobes from a              
              single, planar aperture; and development of a radar capable of                 
              unattended operation for periods of several months, using only                 
              solar cells, storage batteries, or a small propane generator.  The             
              PI requests funds to develop a prototype of all profiler                       
              subsystems, testing the prototype system at sea under a variety of             
              weather conditions, validating the performance of the prototype                
              system using balloon launched radiosondes, and marketing the MBL               
              Profiler in at least two configurations.
