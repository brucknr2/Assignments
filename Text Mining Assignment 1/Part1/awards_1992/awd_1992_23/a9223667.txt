Abstract    :
              Dr. Cittadino is continuing his investigation into the formative               
              period in the development of ecology as a science, i.e. the period             
              between World Wars I & II.  He is undertaking this study from an               
              international perspective and with every effort to interrelate                 
              intellectual, cultural, social, and institutional themes.  The                 
              research involves examining primary and secondary source material              
              and visiting selected archival sites.  The interwar period                     
              witnessed the intellectual and institutional maturation of ecology,            
              the emergence of methodologies and concepts usually associated with            
              the postwar period, the emergence of identifiable schools, and the             
              initial encounters between this new science and a variety of social            
              and ideological views and practices.  This study represents a                  
              substantial contribution to the historical understanding of                    
              ecological science and offers a unique perspective of a multi-                 
              dimensional study carried out from an international point of view.
