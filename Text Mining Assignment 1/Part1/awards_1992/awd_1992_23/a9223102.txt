Abstract    :
                   The proposed study will explore factors that influence the                
              adoption and use of electronic networks by science and engineering             
              faculty members in small universities and colleges.  The various               
              factors that will be examined are categorized as system factors,               
              personal and professional factors, and institutional factors.  The             
              results of the study will provide institutions of higher education             
              and science funding bodies with information on which to base policy            
              decisions regarding resource allocations and planning for                      
              electronic networks.
