Abstract    :
                9223092  Brown  During an earthquake, a structure must be provided with some 
              lateral restraint by the foundation because of the  horizontal accelerations
              involved.  For piles embedded in  liquefaction-susceptible soils, this lateral
              support  requirement can dominate the design of the foundation.    The
              objective of this project is to evaluate the lateral  soil resistance exerted
              on a deep foundation during a strong  earthquake which causes the cohesionless
              soil to liquefy.  The aim is to improve the understanding, and provide a 
              better estimate, of the lateral support provided by  liquefied soil: currently
              the lateral resistance of  liquefied soil is completely neglected in design,
              leading to  a conservative and therefore more expensive building  foundation. 
              Preliminary studies show that even small  amounts of soil resistance result in
              a more economic design.  Therefore the lateral soil resistance -- although it
              is  expected to be low -- should be quantified and included in  the design.   
              This research project includes a large-scale (nearly full  scale) experimental
              study under laboratory controlled  conditions.  It consists of a large
              sand-filled liquefaction  tank, in which the sand in liquefied, and an
              instrumented  shaft is accelerated horizontally to measure the lateral 
              resistance of the liquefied soil.  This experiment does not  attempt to model
              the complete pile behavior.  The complete  lateral behavior is modeled
              numerically once the correct  lateral soil resistance in the liquefied zone is
              measured  and understood.  ***
