Abstract    :
                   The award is for partial funding in support of the                        
              "International Conference on Cold Warm Forging Technology - 1992,"             
              to be held at Ohio State University in October, 1992.  The                     
              conference will address issues related to the improvement of                   
              productivity in cold and warm forming and in the adaptation of low             
              temperature forging processes to the forming of parts that are                 
              conventionally formed by hot forging.  The funds will be applied               
              to defraying part of the travel costs of seven invited speakers                
              from universities in Europe and Japan, where the subject                       
              technologies are much further advanced than in the United States.              
              This will allow United States attendees to be exposed to cutting               
              edge technologies from abroad and will encourage the diffusion                 
              knowledge concerning the best available manufacturing technologies,            
              worldwide, into the manufacturing research community, in industry              
              and at universities.
