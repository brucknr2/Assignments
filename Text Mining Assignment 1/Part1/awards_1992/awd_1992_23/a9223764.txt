Abstract    :
                                                  9223764  Nogami    Fundamental aspects of
              surface electromigration(SE) of metals on  silicon will be studied using hot
              scanning tunneling  microscopy(STM).  The instrumentation used and experimental
               approach followed will allow atomic level resolution and  identification of
              fundamental forces involved in the  electromigration process.  Another part of
              the research is to  understand the effects of surface electromigration on
              overlayer  growth, and to explore the possibility of using electromigration  to
               control crystal growth.  %%%  This research is expected to provide fundamental
              new information  about semiconductor materials which are widely used for VLSI 
              technology.  State-of-the-art surface instrumentation and methods  are expected
              to reveal atomic scale features of surface  electromigration, a phenomena
              thought to be related to failure of  integrated circuit metal interconnect
              lines.  The materials under  study have wide applicability in electronic and
              optoelectronic  devices, and a greater understanding of electromigration is 
              expected to improve the performance of devices and circuits made  from these
              materials, and may lead to improvements in the  performance of integrated
              circuits used in computing, information  processing, and telecommunications.
