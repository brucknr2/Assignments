Abstract    :
                   This award supports a symposium on scientific issues in the               
              flow and fracture of ceramic and geological systems.  As the issues            
              have attracted the efforts of both the materials science and                   
              experimental and theoretical geophysics communities, this symposium            
              will specifically emphasize topics of mutual interest and activity,            
              seeking primarily to foster communication and continued interaction            
              amongst the communities.  Topics to be addressed at the symposium              
              are many, but include (1) the nature of brittle fracture, including            
              mechanisms of toughening and of slow crack growth, (2) the                     
              mechanical properties of granular (porous and non-porous)                      
              aggregates, (3) polyphase rheology, including factors affecting                
              engineered polyphase structures (e.g., fiber composites).  A group             
              of eminent scientists in both communities will contribute to the               
              symposium; further, the symposium itself is being organized by a               
              small committee that additionally represents the interface between             
              the two communities.
