Abstract    :
              The focus of this research is development of new methodology                   
              for the synthesis of moderately complex monofluoro organic                     
              compounds which are useful for probing chemical and biological                 
              properties. The general use of four recently prepared                          
              fluorinated synthetic units will be investigated to determine                  
              their scope and applicability in the synthesis of fluorinated                  
              materials, including fluorinated nucleosides, fluorinated                      
              butenolides and furans, and fluorinated analogs of natural                     
              products. The synthesis of two new fluorinated units will be                   
              carried out: a chiral 1,3-oxazoline will be prepared for use in                
              the synthesis of chiral 2-fluorocarboxylic acids, and two                      
              isomers of the 2-fluoromuconate system will be prepared for use                
              in the inverse electron demand Diels-Alder reaction.

              With this Renewal award, the Synthetic Organic Program is                      
              supporting the research of Dr. Timothy B. Patrick of the                       
              Department of Chemistry at Southern Illinois University at                     
              Edwardsville. Professor Patrick will focus his work on the                     
              development of new methodology for the synthesis of moderately                 
              complex monofluorinated organic compounds which are useful                     
              probes of chemical and biological properties.
