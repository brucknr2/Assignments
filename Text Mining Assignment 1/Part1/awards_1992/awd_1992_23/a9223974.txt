Abstract    :
              Building on the results of a previous grant, this research will                
              collect and compile data sets in computer readable files, and                  
              conduct a comparative empirical and theoretical study of the                   
              nature, evolution, and implications of specific non-market                     
              economic institutions in England and Italy between the twelfth                 
              and fifteenth centuries.  The research will concentrate on the                 
              institutions that supported "anonymous" markets for goods which                
              are separated by time place such as credit markets and contracts               
              for future delivery.  An extensive data collection effort and a                
              theoretical framework, building on recent developments in game                 
              theory, contract theory, and organization theory, will facilitate              
              an empirical examination of these institutions.  In addition, the              
              study is aimed at compiling data sets which will provide a better              
              understanding of the institutions that governed agency relations               
              in Genoa during the twelfth and early thirteenth centuries.  To                
              analyze and present this data, the research will take advantage                
              of an analytical method which so far has not been utilized by                  
              economic historians, namely, network analysis.  This research is               
              important because it will shed new light on the nature and                     
              evolution of modern institutions, thereby facilitating the                     
              understanding of the institutional transition that developing                  
              economies and the economies of the former Eastern block still                  
              face.
