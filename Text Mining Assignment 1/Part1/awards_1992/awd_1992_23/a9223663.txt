Abstract    :
                    This project plans to conduct fundamental studies of the                 
              sintering behavior of two model two-phase ceramic systems.  One                
              system is the alumina containing sub-micron SiC particles.  It is              
              used to test the particle pinning theories of grain growth                     
              inhibition.  Another system is the slumina containing calcium                  
              aluminosilicate glass.  It is designed to investigate the effect of            
              pore size distribution on the kinetics of densification during                 
              liquid phase sintering.                                                        
                                                                                             
              %%%%%                                                                          
                                                                                             
                    This proposal uses two  model systems of two-phase ceramic               
              materials, and investigate their sintering behaviors.  Detailed                
              experimental characterizations of the material system during the               
              sintering are used to be compared with know theories.  Through this            
              approach, better understanding of the sintering of two-phase                   
              ceramic systems can be achieved.
