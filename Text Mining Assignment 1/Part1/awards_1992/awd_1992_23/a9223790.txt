Abstract    :
              This award supports a program to characterize tephras in Alaska                
              and Siberia in order to better understand the volume, extent, and              
              climatic effects of large volcanic eruptions in the Arctic.  The               
              project will fingerprint tephras by major and trace element                    
              analytical methods and will develop a chronologic record of                    
              tephras that can be used for correlating volcanic ash layers in                
              ice core acquired through the Greenland Ice Sheet Project-2                    
              (GISP2).  Estimates of the volume of ash erupted in each event                 
              will be important input to climate models because volcanic ash in              
              the atmosphere is known to cause temperature decreases.
