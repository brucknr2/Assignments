Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This is a study of the social roots of environmental damage that               
              will apply world systems theory to the linkages between social                 
              classes, economic growth, greenhouse gas emissions, and                        
              deforestation.  The study will combine: (1) a cross-sectional                  
              analysis of 125 countries; (2) a short time-series analysis on                 
              greenhouse gas emissions and economic structure; (3) a long time-              
              series analysis of cyclical economic production and periodicities              
              in emissions.                                                                  
                                                                                             
              This interdisciplinary study will play a major role in founding an             
              important new field within sociology: international statistical                
              research on the social factors that harm or protect the                        
              environment.  In addition to charting new intellectual territory               
              for social scientists, this study will offer insights to policy                
              makers concerning the environmental consequences of world-wide                 
              social trends.
