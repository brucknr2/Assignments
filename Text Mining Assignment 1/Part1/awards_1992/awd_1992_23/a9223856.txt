Abstract    :
              In order to have an effective agreement on greenhouse warming, it              
              will be necessary to have credible and comparable estimates of                 
              greenhouse gas emissions and economic impacts of their mitigation              
              for as many nations as possible.  An operational methodology is                
              needed that can be standardized across country contexts and that               
              can capitalize on existing economic data bases.  One such                      
              methodology is structural decomposition analysis (SDA).  The                   
              purpose of this project is to develop a stronger theoretical base              
              for the SDA methodology using the tools of applied                             
              microeconomics, more specifically production theory, applied                   
              demand analysis, and growth theory.  While SDA estimating                      
              equations in the past have been specified in an ad hoc manner,                 
              this research will involve developing a formal derivation of                   
              these equations.  This research is important because it will                   
              provide researchers and policy makers with a firmly grounded                   
              alternative to the more conventional macroeconometric and                      
              computable general equilibrium approaches which, because of data               
              limitations, are difficult to use in making cross country                      
              comparisons.
