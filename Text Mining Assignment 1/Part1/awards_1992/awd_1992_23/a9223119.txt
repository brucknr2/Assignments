Abstract    :
              An innovative method to control and enhance turbulent heat                     
              transfer through the use of Lorentz force is proposed.                         
              Properly directed, the force control turbulence production in                  
              the boundary layers. This approach is called magnetic                          
              turbulence control (MTC). The feasibility of the method has                    
              been demonstrated in experiments on flat plate turbulent                       
              boundary layers with Reynolds number (based on momentum                        
              thickness) 1700. Measured turbulent stress was reduced by 90%.                 
              Laser-sheet flow visualization confirms the substantial                        
              reductions in turbulent motion at y+ = < 15. One of the                        
              attractive features of this approach is that through the                       
              proper selection of E and B fields and the introduction of the                 
              conducting fluid, very small power consumption is needed. In                   
              the proposed research, MTC will be extended to thermal                         
              boundary layers in water. Correlations between electromagnetic                 
              field strengths, heat transfer and shear stress will be                        
              determined. A further area of investigation may be the effect                  
              of MTC at increased Reynolds numbers.
