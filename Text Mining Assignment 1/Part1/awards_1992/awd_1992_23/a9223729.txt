Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The goal of this research is to study the structure and dynamical              
              behavior of liquid crystal phases using optical microscopy, light              
              and x-ray scattering, and scanning tunneling microscopy.  Systems              
              to be probed include planar freely suspended liquid crystal films,             
              ultrathin preparations between solid substrates, liquid crystals               
              confined to an aerogel matrix, and liquid crystal-solid interface.             
              The research is directed toward elucidating the effects of surfaces            
              and reduced dimensionality on liquid crystal fluctuations, ordering            
              and phase transitions.  The proposed studies are important because             
              of their fundamental impact on condensed matter physics and due to             
              technological interests.                                                       
              %%%                                                                            
              This research is focused on freely suspended liquid crystal films,             
              ultrathin preparations between solid substrates, liquid crystals in            
              porous media, and scanning tunneling microscopy of adsorbed liquid             
              crystal layers.  The research is directed toward elucidating the               
              effects of surfaces and reduced dimensionality on liquid crystal               
              fluctuations, ordering and phase transitions.  Freely suspended                
              liquid crystal films are structures of fundamental interest in                 
              condensed matter physics because they are the thinnest known stable            
              condensed phase structures and have the largest surface-to-volume              
              ratio of any condensed phase preparation.  The weak ordering and               
              strong interface interactions of liquid crystals makes them ideal              
              materials for studying the physics of condensed phase transition in            
              porous media.  This area is emerging as an exciting extension of               
              liquid crystal phase research of the past two decades.  Ultrathin              
              liquid crystal films between solid substrates are not only of broad            
              technological interest but they continue to generate a variety of              
              interesting basic physics problems.
