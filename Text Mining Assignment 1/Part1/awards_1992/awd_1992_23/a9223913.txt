Abstract    :
              This project will build and fly on balloons instruments for                    
              measuring the size and other characteristics of particles found in             
              the arctic stratosphere.  These condensation nuclei (CN) and polar             
              stratospheric cloud (PSC) particles play an important role in the              
              destruction of ozone by catalytic action of chlorine.  The balloon             
              measurements will be made at the same time as nitric acid (HNO3)               
              vapor measurements will be made by another team from Max Planck                
              Institute, Heidelberg, Germany.  Nitric acid is one of the main                
              constituents of the PSC particles.                                             
                                                                                             
              This work is important to increasing understanding of the processes            
              which cause the annual springtime decreases of ozone in both polar             
              regions, and also to help understand the differences between the               
              Arctic and Antarctic stratosphere.
