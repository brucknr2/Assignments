Abstract    :
              This project is a workshop for faculty women who are structural                
              engineers to discuss the problems faced by women in the                        
              profession of structural engineering.  It is important for NSF                 
              and universities to know the concerns of recruiting and retaining              
              women in the professional ranks of academics.  The workshop will               
              discuss the many problems encountered by women who have selected               
              engineering careers in academics and publish a report on the                   
              proceedings.
