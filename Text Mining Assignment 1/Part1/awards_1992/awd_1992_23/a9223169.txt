Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              MU-SPIN, The Minority University-Space Interdisciplinary Network,              
              is a program for minority universities, as well as colleges with               
              significant minority enrollments, which is oriented around wide                
              area networking technology and its use for supporting multi-                   
              disciplinary research.  Sponsorship is by the NASA Goddard Space               
              Flight Center, Data and Computing Division, the University Programs            
              Office, the Equal Opportunity Office, and NASA Headquarters.                   
                                                                                             
              Based on the success of the 1991 meeting, this project is to                   
              support the second meeting of the MU-SPIN Users Working Group,                 
              September 13-15, 1992 at the Goddard Space Flight Center.  The                 
              meeting is to provide a forum for the exchange of ideas on                     
              networking to support interdisciplinary research.                              
                                                                                             
              Funding will support the cost of participant travel, meals, and                
              meeting arrangements.  The project is directly related to the                  
              interest of the Computer and Information Science and Engineering               
              Directorate in that CISE is actively supporting programs to enhance            
              the opportunities of underrepresented population in the computer               
              field.  Access to adequate facilities, and the interchange made                
              available by the network connections is an important aspect of this            
              effort, and the program of the workshop should enhance the                     
              opportunities of the participants.
