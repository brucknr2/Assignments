Abstract    :
                   The Phase II effort will address three basic topics related               
              to the abrasive suspension jet (ABJ) process.  First, a study will             
              be conducted on suspension preparation and the effect of                       
              rheological characteristics on jet coherency and cutting                       
              performance.  The rheological characteristics of the suspension                
              will be modeled and correlated with the jet's structure and the                
              resultant machining performance.  The second topic is related to               
              nozzle optimization and jet flow modeling and will also involve                
              exploring alternative nozzle concepts and new materials.  The                  
              suspension acceleration process and the jet's structure will be                
              modeled.  The third area of study will address the jet-material                
              interaction process for cutting and drilling.  Previously developed            
              abrasive water jet (AWJ) models will be used to guide the                      
              development of an ASJ cutting prediction model.  Jet and jet-                  
              material interface visualization techniques will be used in this               
              program.  The results of this work will be used in parallel                    
              engineering efforts on pump development for commercialization.                 
                   The technology developed under this program will have                     
              significant direct and indirect effects in several commercial                  
              fields.  The high-velocity flow of ASJs will introduce a new                   
              cutting beam to the machining industry.  The ASJ beam is highly                
              efficient and capable of machining any material.  Cutting,                     
              drilling, turning, milling, polishing, deburring, and other                    
              machining operations could be performed with the same tool.
