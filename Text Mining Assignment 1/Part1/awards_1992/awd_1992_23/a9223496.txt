Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This is a phase II award under the small Business Innovation                   
              Research program.  In Phase I, the efficient photocatalytic                    
              decomposition over titanium dioxide of several organic                         
              pollutants in the gas phase under a range of concentrations and                
              conditions was demonstrated.  In this work, it will be                         
              established whether the pollutants are in fact detoxified and                  
              not converted to decomposition products that are still toxic in                
              an environmental sense.  The products of the process under                     
              various radiation intensities, flow rates, and concentrations                  
              are identified.  Photoefficiency and product measurements are                  
              made for gas streams typical of those found in the field.  An                  
              attempt to define the useful scope of the gas-phase                            
              sensitization method is made.
