Abstract    :
              9223165  Rauber         This project is aimed at determining the physics of the 
              production and evolution of rain in warm clouds.  The initial goal  of the
              research is to integrate the various data obtained by radars  and aircraft in
              the Hawaiian Rainband Project to derive physically  coherent descriptions of
              the evolution of rain in tropical clouds  from the time of cloud formation to
              the development of the mature  rain shaft.  The second goal is to conduct
              detailed modeling  studies to better clarify the physics of the warm rain
              process that  cannot be deduced directly from the observations.   ***
