Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              An extensive series of imaging and spectroscopic                               
              observations and analysis designed to test for and measure                     
              the distribution of the putative dark matter in dwarf                          
              spheroidal galaxies will be carried out in this research                       
              grant.  The velocity dispersion, or characteristic width, of                   
              stars in the Leo I and Leo II systems will be measured for                     
              the first time.  These are key objects for deciding if the                     
              large velocity dispersions measured in the other dwarf                         
              spheroidal galaxies are caused by tides or the presence of                     
              dark matter.  Multifiber spectroscopic data have been                          
              collected for the Ursa Minor, Draco, and Sextan dwarf                          
              galaxies.  Combined with echelle data for the Fornax galaxy                    
              and with new observations, these data will allow the                           
              gravitational potential of these galaxies, not just their                      
              mass, to be determined.  Measurement of the mass-to-light                      
              ratio of the distant halo globular cluster NGC2419, which is                   
              thought to contain no dark matter, will provide a necessary                    
              comparison when assessing the mass-to-light ratios of the                      
              dwarf spheroidal galaxies.  Extensive imaging data to                          
              improve or measure the structure of these low luminosity                       
              galaxies has been collected.  Finally, further radio                           
              observations of some intriguing radio sources with no                          
              optical counterparts will be made.                                             
                                                                                             
              This project is a collaborative project with Dr. Edward W.                     
              Olszweski of the University of Arizona (AST 9223967).
