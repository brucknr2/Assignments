Abstract    :
                   This is the first year funding of a three-year continuing                 
              award.  The rapidly growing stores of information in molecular                 
              biology present an ever-increasing demand for automated analysis.              
              In order to extract knowledge from these databases efficiently,                
              computer scientists must join with researchers in other fields to              
              develop tools for this analysis, since the complexity of these new             
              databases antiquates traditional manual analysis techniques.  This             
              project will develop new algorithms, integrating old ones where                
              necessary, and apply these algorithms to the problem of extracting             
              knowledge  from scientific databases, especially those being                   
              assembled by researchers in molecular biology.  The strengths and              
              weaknesses of these algorithms will be explored through careful                
              experimentation.  The algorithms developed will employ techniques              
              of classification, clustering, and search which may be                         
              generalizable to other problem domains.//
