Abstract    :
              The Principal Investigators (PIs)                                              
              propose to develop solid-phase                                                 
              heterogenous enzyme-linked                                                     
              immunosorbent assays (ELISAs).  The                                            
              proposed approach is to use                                                    
              phospholipid-based vesicles                                                    
              (liposomes) whose outer surfaces                                               
              have been modified by the covalent                                             
              attachment of 100 to 200 enzyme                                                
              molecules as well as a variable, but                                           
              smaller, number of specific analyte                                            
              or antibody molecules.  The                                                    
              potential signal enhancement that                                              
              could be achieved by hundreds of                                               
              attached enzyme molecules, rather                                              
              than one or a few, to the analyte or                                           
              antibody could result in a reduction                                           
              of the limit of sensitivity of an                                              
              ELISA by two orders of magnitude                                               
              relative to current technology.
