Abstract    :
                   A modified Faddeev formalism which accounts for long                      
              range Coulomb interactions is used to study a number of                        
              important three body problems.  The numerical methods make                     
              heavy use of spline techniques in multiple dimensions to                       
              assure continuity of the wavefunction and its derivatives                      
              across natural boundaries.  Applications to electrons,                         
              positrons and muonic systems are proposed.
