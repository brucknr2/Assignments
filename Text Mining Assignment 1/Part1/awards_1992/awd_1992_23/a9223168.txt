Abstract    :
              There is now compelling evidence that the modification of proteins             
              with ADP-ribose is a general feature of endogenous eucaryotice                 
              metabolism.  The study of this metabolism has been limited due to              
              a lack of analytical methods of sufficient sensitivity and                     
              selectivity.  The overall objective of this proposal is to achieve             
              an understanding of the chemistry of ADP:protein linkages. The                 
              approach is to use ADP-ribosyl amino acids as model systems.  These            
              will be synthesized, isolated and characterized and used as                    
              references standards for the development of methods which will                 
              allow the direct identification of ADP-ribosyl amino acid residues             
              in endogenous proteins.  The research will lay the groundwork for              
              understanding endogenous eucaryotic ADP-ribose metabolism and the              
              mode of action of bacterial toxins.
