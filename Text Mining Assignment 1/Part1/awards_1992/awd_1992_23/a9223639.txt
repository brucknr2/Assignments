Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The Gordon Research Conference on the Physics and Chemistry of                 
              Laser Diagnostics in Combustion has been held biennially since                 
              1981.  The 1993 meeting will be held in July, 1993 at Plymouth                 
              State College in New Hampshire.  The purpose of this                           
              conference is to examine closely and discuss freely the                        
              chemical and physical foundations of the various laser                         
              diagnostic techniques including such issues as quenching,                      
              energy transfer, quantitative species concentration                            
              measurements, line spacings, line widths, and convolutions.                    
              New themes of the 1993 conference will include laser                           
              diagnostics of resonant wave-mixing techniques, the                            
              interaction between the modeling of chemical flame structure                   
              and laser diagnostics, and the metrology of particle                           
              diagnostics.  The emphasis of the conference is directed                       
              toward the science of the measurement processes.  The invited                  
              speakers and discussion leaders include researchers                            
              specializing in the development and application of laser                       
              diagnostics in combustion as well as investigators from basic                  
              areas not directly involved in laser diagnostics.                              
                                                                                             
              The major products of this conference will be the exchange of                  
              information between researchers on the cutting edge of this                    
              technology area, hopefully leading to synergism which will                     
              result in further advances, and a final report which will                      
              summarize the activities of the conference.
