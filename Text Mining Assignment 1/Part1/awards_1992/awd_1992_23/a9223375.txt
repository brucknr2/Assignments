Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  A nation's official statistics are directly affected by the               
              quality of the data derived from its business,  economic and                   
              agricultural surveys.  Yet there are few commonly accepted and                 
              practiced methodologies for these surveys-- unlike the situation               
              for social and demographic surveys.  The reasons for this situation            
              are diverse,  the most important ones being that establishment                 
              surveys face much more difficult design and execution problems and             
              that far less is published on strategies to solve these problems.              
                   The International Conference on Establishment Surveys (ICES)              
              is being planned  (1) to provide a forum to describe current                   
              methods being used for surveys of businesses,  farms,  and                     
              institutions;  (2)  to present new or improved technologies for                
              solving the unique problems associated with establishment surveys;             
              and (3)  to promote international exchange of ideas by providing               
              an opportunity for business,  economic,  agricultural and                      
              statistical researchers to exchange ideas for future                           
              interdisciplinary and even cross-country research.                             
                   This conference is being jointly supported by the American                
              Statistical Association (ASA,  Survey Methods Section and Business             
              and Economic Statistics Section),  the International Association               
              of Survey Statisticians (IASS),  the National Association of                   
              Business Economists  (NABE),  Statistics Canada,  and the                      
              Statistical Society of Canada (SSC).  The meeting is currently                 
              scheduled to be held at Buffalo,  New York,  June 27-30,  1993.                
                   This Conference could be an important beginning in an effort              
              to focus more attention on critical methodological issues in the               
              area of surveys of business establishments.  The people and the                
              government agencies involved are representative both of those that             
              have work going on in the field and those who should begin such                
              work.  The interaction among those responsible for the design and              
              implementation of establishment surveys across agencies and across             
              countries is likely to contribute to an improvement in the quality             
              of U.S. statistics.
