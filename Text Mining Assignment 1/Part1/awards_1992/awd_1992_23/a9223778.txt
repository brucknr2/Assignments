Abstract    :
              Impact-echo is a nondestructive test method for concrete                       
              structures which is based on the use of transient stress waves.                
              The usefulness of the method has been demonstrated in previous                 
              research.  This project outlines research to determine the                     
              accuracy and precision of the method for measuring the thickness               
              of and depth of flaws in slabs.  The research includes numerical,              
              laboratory, and field studies directed at determining what                     
              factors affect the accuracy and precision of impact-echo                       
              measurements.  A procedure for calibration of instrumentation                  
              will also be developed.  A tentative test procedure will be                    
              developed and used in field work carried out in conjunction with               
              the Federal Highway Administration and State highway departments               
              to determine new pavement thickness.  Results will be verified by              
              sample cores.  The knowledge and data acquired from this project               
              will be used to write a research report which will lay the basis               
              for developing a draft standard.
