Abstract    :
              9223390  Miller    Three recent developments lead to this proposal.  1.  The 
              electrochemical preparation of a polymer with highly anisotropic  conductivity.
               2.  The first example of self-assembly of ion-  radicals into delocalized
              pi-stacks in solution.  3.  The formation  of aromatic (not aliphatic)
              self-assembled and Langmuir-Blodgett  films.  Using imides and their anion
              radicals, it is proposed to  construct three types of unusual materials: 
              conducting polymer  films organized by pi-stacking; organized aromatic surface
              layers;  and nanoscale dendrimers with conducting surfaces.  These materials 
              will be studied using electrochemistry, VIS, NIR, IR, XPS and ESR 
              spectroscopy, grazing angle IR, VIS NIR linear dichroism, X-ray  diffraction,
              DSC and conductivity measurements.    The results promise to be significant in
              several regards.  These  new material types have little or no precedent, and
              the  intermolecular organization provided by pi-stacking should provide 
              unusual electrical and optical properties.  It is expected that  fundamentally
              new approaches to the synthesis of anisotropic bulk  polymers and nanoscale
              materials will be revealed.  ***
