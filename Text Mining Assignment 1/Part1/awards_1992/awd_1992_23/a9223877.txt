Abstract    :
              Tlingit and Haida Indians of Southeast Alaska, together with other             
              Alaska Natives, attended the Sheldon Jackson School in Sitka                   
              between 1881 and 1940. This school was run by Presbyterian                     
              missionaries and their work produced numerous social and cultural              
              changes. This dissertation study, which incorporates historical                
              case studies and ethnographic interviews, is designed to analyze               
              educational history against the backdrop of the experiences and                
              aspirations of former students and their families.
