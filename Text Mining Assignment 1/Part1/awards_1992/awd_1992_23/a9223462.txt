Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Over the past decade, foreign direct investment among                          
              industrialized countries has grown substantially, frequently                   
              flowing across borders in both directions within the same industry.            
              In addition, in several industrialized countries, multinational                
              production substantially dominates exports as the vehicle for                  
              foreign market penetration.  These trends have received little                 
              attention from economists, who focus a disproportionate share of               
              attention on trade, and largely ignore intraindustry investment.               
                                                                                             
              This research will analyze the relationship between the                        
              international location decisions of firms and trade.  It will                  
              incorporate multinationals into a general equilibrium model of                 
              trade with differentiated products.  The model will explain                    
              intraindustry investment in terms of a tradeoff between                        
              concentration and proximity advantages, and contrast this with                 
              investment motivated by factor endowment differences.  The project             
              will then use a partial equilibrium framework to examine the firm's            
              choice between exporting and overseas production in a setting with             
              dynamic market share dependence.  It will also investigate the                 
              policy implications.                                                           
                                                                                             
              These relationships will be tested empirically.  The empirical                 
              tests will be based on gravity equations, which are ideally suited             
              to comparing the roles of transport cost and trade barriers in                 
              explaining the choice between multinational production and trade.
