Abstract    :
              9223872  Law    This project will support research on the study of surface 
              nucleation and growth of droplets to a uniform film, called a  wetting layer,
              at liquid mixture surfaces.  The physics behind the  process of surface
              nucleation is not well understood, nor is the  coalescence of droplets to a
              uniform film on a surface well  understood.  It is important to gain an
              impordec understanding of  such phenomena because the existance of wetting
              layers on surfaces  is technologically very important, especially for solid
              surfaces.   Wetting layers on solid surfaces modigy the physical and chemical 
              properties of that surface.  They are important in such processes  as
              lubrication and tertiary oil recovery.  A better understanding  of the physics
              behind wetting layer formation will enable the  properties of these films to be
              controlled more precisely and also  enable the development of films with new
              and novel characteristics.  ***
