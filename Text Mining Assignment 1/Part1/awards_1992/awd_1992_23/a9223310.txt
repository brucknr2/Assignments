Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This action is to provide travel fellowships and participant                   
              support costs for young American scientists to attend the 1993                 
              International Symposium on cholecystokinin, (CCK) a peptide                    
              occurring in the brain and intestine.  This meeting is to be held              
              May 19-22, 1993 on Cape Cod, Massachusetts.  New breakthroughs in              
              this rapidly advancing area make this 1993 symposium very timely               
              for dissemination of information and the fostering of                          
              interdisciplinary collaborations.  Moreover, this symposium                    
              provides a forum for interactions of some of the most outstanding              
              investigators from throughout the world with young American                    
              scientists.  These exciting advances including the elucidation of              
              the structure of the CCK receptor and the development of new non-              
              peptide agonists and antagonist specific for CCK receptor                      
              subtypes will be addressed in the state-of-the-art lectures. The               
              topics of the session include the biochemistry and molecular                   
              biology of CCK and its receptors; the pharmacology of CCK and its              
              antagonists; and the neurophysiology and gastrointestinal                      
              physiology of CCK.  Moreover, current issues on the role of CCK                
              in satiety and disease will also be extensively explored.  These               
              and other advances will most certainly lead to a better                        
              understanding of the important role of CCK in gastrointestinal                 
              physiology and in central nervous system function.
