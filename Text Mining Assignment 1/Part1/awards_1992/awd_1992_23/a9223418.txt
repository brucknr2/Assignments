Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                                                                                             
                  This study in social onomatology will evaluate six theoretical            
              propositions on the origins of social standards through analysis of            
              multi-decade datasets on children's first names, including                     
              information about social characteristics of the parents.  The                  
              research examines both exogenous forces and internal mechanisms                
              that transform habits of naming.  Among the factors that may be                
              significant are: family structures, social movements, fashion                  
              cycles, race relations, social class, popular culture, and parental            
              age cohort.                                                                    
                                                                                             
                   Perhaps because first names are such familiar parts of daily              
              life, sociologists have not exploited them as potent sources of                
              information about changing cultural standards.  Yet one of the most            
              important and sociologically revealing decisions a person can make             
              is what to name a child.  This study will apply sophisticated                  
              analytical techniques to extensive datasets, investigating the                 
              social changes throughout the twentieth century reflected in what              
              Americans named their children.
