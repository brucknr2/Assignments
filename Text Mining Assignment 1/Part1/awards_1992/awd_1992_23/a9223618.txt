Abstract    :
                   This planning grant will support preliminary studies in                   
              two areas of theoretical physics that bear on our fundamental                  
              understanding of nucleon and antinucleon structure and                         
              interactions: 1) the interpretation of antiprotonic atom                       
              energy level shifts and widths; and 2) the determination of                    
              strange quark contributions to nucleon structure.  The                         
              objective of the planning grant is the development of a                        
              competitive research proposal that will be submitted to the                    
              "Research in Undergraduate Institutions" program of the                        
              National Science Foundation.  The activities to be supported                   
              in the preparation of that proposal will include:                              
              participation in the "Nuclear Physics in Atoms and Molecules"                  
              program of the National Institute for Nuclear Theory;                          
              consultation with physicists active in both areas of research;                 
              study of models used for nucleon and antinucleon structure and                 
              interactions; the development of computer code; and                            
              preliminary calculations to determine the most promising                       
              direction for the research.  A program will be developed to                    
              include undergraduate students in aspects of the research that                 
              are accessible to them.
