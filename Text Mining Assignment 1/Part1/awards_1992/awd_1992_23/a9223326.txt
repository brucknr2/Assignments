Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  This project will develop a set of collaborative studies about            
              social change, health, and demographic behavior in Russia.  Travel             
              support will allow training and design of future waves of the                  
              Russia Longitudinal Monitoring Survey.  RLMS data will be used to              
              examine: (1) living arrangements and welfare of the elderly; (2)               
              role dynamics, health and reproduction; (3) female-headed                      
              households; (4) dynamics of abortion and conception.                           
                                                                                             
                   Not only will this project strengthen international scientific            
              cooperation between the United States and Russia, but it will place            
              Russian sociological data-gathering on a much more rigorous basis.             
              One result will be a substantial body of data about Russian family             
              well-being and demographics during a period of vast and rapid                  
              social transformation.
