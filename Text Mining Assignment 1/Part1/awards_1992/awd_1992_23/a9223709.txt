Abstract    :
              Professor James Mayer of the University of Washington will                     
              conduct basic research on oxo-organometallic chemistry with                    
              support from the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic                   
              Program.  This will be a three-pronged effort towards                          
              discovering and developing reactions in which the metal-oxo                    
              functionality is involved in fundamental transformations of                    
              organic molecules.  Tungsten-phosphine compounds of the type                   
              WCl2(PR3)4 will be investigated in their oxygen-abstraction                    
              reactions with alcohols, trimethylsylyl ethers, and                            
              carboxylates.  Similar reactions involving sulfido and imido                   
              functionalities will also be studied.  In the second area of                   
              research, the chemistry of rhenium-oxo-acetylene compounds will                
              be explored.  These reactions will include hydroxide to                        
              oxo-hydride migrations, and reductions and deprotonations.  The                
              third area of research will examine                                            
              rhenium-oxo-tris(pyrazolyl)borate chemistry, specifically                      
              photochemical arene activation and migratory insertion of the                  
              oxo group into rhenium-alkyl bonds.  These studies will lead to                
              a general broadening of knowledge in the area of                               
              oxo-organometallic chemistry, with potential applications to                   
              major industrial oxo-organic compounds.                                        
              %%%                                                                            
              The field of organometallic chemistry has seen great                           
              application in the chemistry of commercial organic compounds.                  
              This grant will support an extension of organometallic                         
              chemistry into the chemistry of organic compounds containing                   
              oxygen atoms, such as alcohols, ethers, and acids.  The                        
              controlled manipulation of the carbon-oxygen bonds is the                      
              objective of this research, which will exploit the highly                      
              versatile properties of compounds containing the metals                        
              tungsten and rhenium.
