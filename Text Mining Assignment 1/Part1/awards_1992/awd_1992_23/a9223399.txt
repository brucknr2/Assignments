Abstract    :
              The objective of this project is to improve scientific knowledge               
              about the key factors contributing to the performance and                      
              productivity of information systems (I/S) in U.S. corporations.                
              The research is funded under the Joint NSF/Private Sector                      
              Initiative and will be conducted through collaborative work with               
              a Cooperating Organization.  The Cooperating Organization will                 
              provide scientific and practical input, access to study sites,                 
              assistance in data collection, and leadership in dissemination of              
              the results of the research to other corporations.                             
              The research involves five activities: 1) development of models                
              of information services as a production process, 2) collection of              
              data to provide empirical estimates for the social,                            
              organizational and performance variables in the models, 3)                     
              analysis aimed at determining the relationships between these                  
              variables in computer operations and systems development as                    
              separate processes, 4) application of the models in the                        
              operations of at least one organization, and 5) conduct of a                   
              workshop aimed at disseminating the results of the project to                  
              other corporations.                                                            
              The research will advance knowledge in the information systems                 
              field by developing and applying models of the production of                   
              information services.  The models will identify the key variables              
              in I/S production and their inter-relationships, and thereby                   
              provide a means of greater understanding and operational control.              
              The results of the research will be generalizable to the private               
              sector, and are expected to improve performance of the I/S                     
              function in U.S. corporations from "common practice" towards                   
              "best practice."
