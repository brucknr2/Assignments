Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This Americas Program award will support                                       
              continuation of a research collaboration                                       
              between  Dr. Gary L. McPherson of Tulane                                       
              University and Dr I. A. Kawha of the University                                
              of the West Indies, Jamaica.  The research                                     
              focuses on the luminescence spectroscopy and                                   
              excited state dynamics of a series of novel                                    
              macrocyclic complexes containing pairs of rare                                 
              earth ions. Although the luminescence                                          
              properties of a number of the macrocyclic rare                                 
              earth complexes have been examined, many of the                                
              most important features of excited state                                       
              behavior have not been explored. This project                                  
              will provide valuable new information about                                    
              these complexes and their interactions.                                        
                                                                                             
              Preparation and structural characterization of                                 
              these unusual materials will be accomplished by                                
              Dr. Kawha at the University of the West Indies,                                
              while the luminescence of the materials will be                                
              examined in the laser spectroscopy laboratories                                
              at Tulane.  This project will also involve                                     
              undergraduate and graduate students from both                                  
              institutions.
