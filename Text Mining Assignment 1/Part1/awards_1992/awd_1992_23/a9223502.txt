Abstract    :
              This project explores the determinants of industrial location i n              
              terms of both current and historical conditions.  The questions                
              addressed include:  In what urban locations do different                       
              manufacturing industries in the USA concentrate and how much                   
              persistence in location patterns is there over time?  Can                      
              persistence be linked to dynamic externalities and how strongly                
              do measures reflecting various externalities affect productivity               
              measures?  How strong is the direct link between industrial                    
              location patterns and local air quality and has the link weakened              
              in the last twenty years with stronger environmental regulation?               
              What is the indirect link between air quality and industrial                   
              location decisions, given the impact of air quality on wages and               
              rents through disamenity capitalization effects, which impact                  
              firms' costs?                                                                  
                                                                                             
              For metropolitan areas in the USA this study combines data from                
              the Sixth Count of the 1970 Population census (detailed industry               
              employment), the 1972 Census of Manufacturing, the 1987 Census of              
              Manufacturing, and the 1970 and 1987 County Business Patterns                  
              publication (to fill in holes in the Census of Manufacturing                   
              created by censoring for disclosure reasons), and other                        
              government sources (City and County data Book, State and Metro                 
              Area Data Book, and EPA publications).  These data are used to                 
              estimate econometric models of where industries locate, their                  
              scale of operation, their productivity, and the nature and extent              
              of external economies of scale.  They are used to estimate models              
              of the determinants of urban air quality, account for the                      
              interactions between air quality and industrial composition, air               
              quality and wages and rents, and industrial composition and wages              
              and rents.
