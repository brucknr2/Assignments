Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                   This  is  an award under the Grants for Improving  Doctoral              
              Dissertation  Research  program.   It  is  a  study  of   factors              
              explaining how Mexican immigrants do better than members of other              
              ethnic groups in the New York City labor market.  Interviews will              
              be  conducted  among  ethnic Korean and  Greek  owners  of  small              
              businesses  about  their  employment practices  and  reasons  for              
              preferring  to  hire  workers from Mexico.  In  combination  with              
              interviews  carried out among Mexican workers,  these  data  will              
              make  it possible to describe the labor market niches and  social              
              networks  that  have fueled the rise in immigration  from  Mexico              
              into the New York area recently.                                               
                                                                                             
                    The  proposed  research will help  to  shed  light  on  the              
              formation  and  maintenance  of  an  underclass  in  contemporary              
              American  cities and show the social mechanisms by which  members              
              of  some ethnic groups managed to escape from the underclass.  As              
              such  this  project  has the potential to contribute  toward  the              
              amelioration of a serious social problem in American society.  In              
              addition  to the scientific gains to be achieved by the research,              
              this  award will materially assist a highly promising student  in              
              completing  research  for  the  Ph.D.  dissertation.    Thus   it              
              contributes to the future scientific manpower of the  nation  and              
              the   thorough  training  of  the  next  generation   of   social              
              scientists.
