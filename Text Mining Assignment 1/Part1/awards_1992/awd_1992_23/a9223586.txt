Abstract    :
              Theoretical research will be conducted on non-equilibrium                      
              superconductivity, an area of great current interest and probable              
              technological importance.  First, work will be done on the dynamic             
              properties of the vortex-liquid and vortex-glass phases in                     
              disordered superconductors.  Second, a study will be made of                   
              pattern formation in superconductors due to strong magnetic fields.            
              %%%                                                                            
              The theoretical research done in this award will deal with the                 
              dynamic behavior of the magnetic flux in superconductors and its               
              collective behavior.  An understanding of the behavior of magnetic             
              flux is of fundamental importance and is critical to the                       
              application of superconducting materials.
