Abstract    :
              Stuller         This research has three major objectives:  1.     to derive the
              mathematical operations that should be  performed on two or more stochastic
              signals to obtain  theoretically optimum estimates of the delay or displacement
               between them;  2.     to develop practical systems that attain or closely 
              approximate the theoretically optimum estimates; and  3.     to compare the
              accuracy of the theoretically optimum  estimates with the estimates obtained by
              the practical systems.         The research method is primarily theoretical,
              but includes  computational studies and simulation experiments. The approach 
              has the potential to synthesize the traditional divisions  between:  1.    
              motion estimation based on optical flow and motion  estimation based on feature
              tracking; and  2.     segmentation and motion estimation.         This
              unification should lead to an increased understanding  of image motion
              estimation and improved motion estimation  techniques.
