Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Modern organizations operate under increasing levels of time                   
              pressure:  While the volume of information increases due to                    
              advanced communication and information processing technologies, the            
              time allowed for deliberation and decisions is growing shorter. It             
              is a commonly held belief, supported by many empirical studies,                
              that decisions made under time pressure are inferior, in many                  
              respects, to those made under more benign circumstances.  While                
              advances in information technology are a major contributor to time             
              pressure, appropriate design of information systems could improve              
              decision making under time pressure.  This project involves an                 
              experiment designed to study how decision support systems can                  
              remedy some of the detrimental effects of time pressure on decision            
              making.  This can be achieved by designing a decision support                  
              system that either structures the decision process for the decision            
              maker or that guides the decision maker to use a more structured               
              decision process.  Results are expected to provide both practical              
              guidelines for the design of decision aids to be used in time                  
              pressure environments, and theoretical insights into decision                  
              behavior under time pressure.  The study is viewed also as a                   
              springboard for a research program on the incorporation of decision            
              aids in individual and group decision making under time pressure.
