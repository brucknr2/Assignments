Abstract    :
                   The Grand Valley State University requests support from NSF               
              for an upgrade of their slow speed connection to a medium speed                
              connection of its campus network to NSFNET via MICHnet, Michigan's             
              regional network.  MICHnet will provide operations and network                 
              information services and it will provide Grand Valley State with a             
              high speed connection to the NSFNET, a high speed (1.5 - 45 million            
              bits per second) National Backbone network.                                    
                   The University needs greater functionality and network speed              
              to be able to access supercomputers, libraries, and make file                  
              transfers along with being able to implement a more reliable mail              
              system.  Students and faculty research will benefit from the link.             
              This is also a unique opportunity for the school to explore                    
              innovative educational resources.
