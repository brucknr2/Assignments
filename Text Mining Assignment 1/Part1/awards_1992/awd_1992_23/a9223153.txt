Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The long-term goal of the proposed integrated research is to                   
              exploit the peculiar composition of hackberry (Celtis) endocarps               
              for an isotopic approach to paleoenvironmental reconstructions.                
              This project will quantify how the stable C and O isotopic                     
              composition of organic and inorganic components in the endocarps               
              reflect environmental conditions and how genetic variability                   
              affects these relationships.  Endocarps of Celtis fruit mainly                 
              consist of aragonite, but also contain smaller amounts of organic              
              C.  The high mineral content may be one reason why Celtis endocarps            
              are a common, and well-preserved, plant remnant in Cenozoic                    
              sediments of the Great Plains.  We propose to conduct experiments              
              to determine the effect of individual environmental parameters                 
              (light intensity, water potential, temperature, humidity) on the               
              delta C 13 and delta O 18 values of various plant components and               
              on the isotopic composition of organic matter and carbonate in                 
              Celtis endocarps.  The present relationship of endocarp isotope                
              ratios to regional climate will be examined by collecting Celtis               
              fruit, tissue, and climate data, from many locations in the United             
              States.  We will establish predictive relationships between climate            
              and stable isotope values by sampling a subset of Celtis trees from            
              a USDA experiment involving more than 120 sources of germplasm.                
              These  experiments  at 12 sites in the United States span the                  
              entire north-south temperature range as well as the east-west                  
              rainfall and atmospheric water deficit ranges.  The effects of                 
              diagenesis on the isotope ratios, and its implications for the use             
              of Celtis in Cenozoic paleoclimatic studies, will be examined via              
              short-term experiments.  Should these studies prove encouraging,               
              we will then submit a proposal to begin a second phase of the                  
              project in which we will collect, and isotopically analyze,                    
              endocarps from Holocene to Oligocene sediments of the Great Plains.
