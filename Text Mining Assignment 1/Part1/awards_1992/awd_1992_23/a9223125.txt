Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This project will compare reading processes in three different                 
              writing systems:  English, Chinese, and Hebrew.  Because these                 
              three writing systems differ in structure, they may also differ in             
              how they are read.  The key difference concerns how the sounds of              
              the language are connected to the writing.  In English, which is an            
              alphabetic system, sounds and letters can be connected.  In                    
              Chinese, since there are no letters, the only speech sounds                    
              involved in reading should derive from whole words.  Hebrew is an              
              intermediate case, having letters, but omitting vowels.  The                   
              research method will employ experiments on word identification in              
              the three systems.  As a result of these comparisons, the research             
              will identify both the universal role of phonology across different            
              writing systems and the specific character each system provides to             
              reading.  In the long run, the insights derived from this research             
              can help us devise strategies to overcome reading disabilities in              
              English and other languages.
