Abstract    :
              9223683  Clifton    This award is for the renewal of funding for the Materials
              Research Group at Brown University on the topic of micro- and nano-mechanics of
              failure resistant materials.  The research emphasizes the extension of solid
              mechanics analysis to smaller length scales.  Advances in  high-resolution
              electron microscopy with the development of Computational Fourier Transform
              method for interpreting atomic-resolution micrographs of regions near atomic
              lattice defects have been combined with advances in lattice-statics modelling
              and  modelling of the interactions of discrete dislocations to achieve
              measurements and computations down to  nanometer scale.  The topics emphasized
              include optimization of reinforcement size, shape, and distribution in
              composites; thermal cycling creep of fiber-reinforced composites; frictional 
              resistance to fiber pull-out; void growth by coupled diffusion and deformation;
              crack tip fields; and deformation patterns and shear band formations.    The
              new research addresses improved failure resistance in two critically important
              technologies: composites and microelectronics.  These applications require a
              deeper understanding of the basic mechanisms of plastic deformation and
              fracture on the scale of the microstructure of the material.  The research
              requires expertise in both solid mechanics and materials science and
              engineering.  Students are being trained with skills in these complementary
              disciplines.  *vmpoll  device=*wshell  device=*vfd  device=*parity
