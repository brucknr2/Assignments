Abstract    :
                   Cornell University seeks an additional two years of support               
              for its Gatedaemon Project.  This partial support will help the                
              project's mission of implementing and deploying freely available               
              leading-edge internet routing software for the general good of the             
              internetworking infrastructure.                                                
                   The Gatedaemon Project produces "gated," a modular software               
              program which supports multiple routing protocols.  This software              
              was first used to interconnect the original NSFNET and the emerging            
              regional networks.  since gated's routing protocol implementations             
              are freely available, as they have improved they have become de                
              facto reference implementations.  It is now distributed by several             
              system vendors and used by several router vendors in their                     
              products.  It is also considered to be a platform for routing                  
              protocol research.
