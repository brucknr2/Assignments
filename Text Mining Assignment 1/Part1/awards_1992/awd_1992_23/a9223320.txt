Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This research consists of three projects investigating how economic            
              agents use their past experience to guide their current decisions.             
              The first research project studies agents who use very simple rules            
              of thumb in choosing between alternative technologies; these rules             
              will incorporate the idea that agents try to learn from the                    
              experiences of their neighbors.  The project will investigate the              
              long-run implications of such "social learning," and in particular             
              on when simple rules can lead to efficient long-run outcomes.  The             
              second project studies learning in games.  Here the focus is on                
              when repeated interaction will lead play to correspond to a Nash               
              equilibrium or to one of its refinements.  The third project will              
              develop a model of optimal contracts between a firm's owners and               
              its manager in a setting where the owners learn about the firm's               
              future prospects from its current performance.  The model will                 
              provide an explanation for the widely-observed practice of "income             
              smoothing," under which the manager takes actions that increase                
              reported income when income is low, and decrease reported income               
              when income is high.  This research is important because it tackles            
              and helps provide answers to a few of the most important issues in             
              the economic implications of learning.
