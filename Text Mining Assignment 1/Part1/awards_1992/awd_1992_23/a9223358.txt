Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This proposal is a combination of economics and the psychology of              
              decision making.  The basic decision making problem studied is                 
              repeated decisions made under conditions of risk.  How do people               
              evaluate a risky decision or investment decision which is one of a             
              sequence of such decisions?  The answer turns on three issues:  How            
              they evaluate single trials (or decisions), how they aggregate the             
              trials over time, and how they estimate the cumulative distribution            
              of outcomes.  The combination of these three processes is shown to             
              produce myopic loss aversion -- the tendency to overweight the                 
              chance of losing on a single trial.  This concept of myopic loss               
              aversion is used to try to explain the so-called equity premium                
              puzzle.  The equity premium puzzle refers to the fact that stocks              
              have earned much higher returns than bonds in the last century, and            
              the difference is difficult to explain within the standard economic            
              framework.  The solution investigated in this project implies that             
              investors evaluate their portfolios annually, even though they                 
              usually have a much longer investment horizon.  If evaluation                  
              horizons were longer, then the equity premium would shrink.
