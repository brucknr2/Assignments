Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Funding has been provided through an International Travel                      
              Grant to permit attendance and presentation of a paper at the                  
              Second International Symposium on Engineering Turbulence                       
              Modeling and Measurements, May 31 -June 2, 1993, in Florence.                  
              The research involved Direct Numerical Simulation (DNS) of                     
              turbulence aimed at directly assessing the influence of                        
              ambient turbulence on the transport mechanisms, in the wall                    
              boundary layer, from the flow to the wall.                                     
                                                                                             
              Ambient turbulence in the free stream is known to influence                    
              transfer into the wall, and it is an important factor in a                     
              broad variety of engineering flow systems.
