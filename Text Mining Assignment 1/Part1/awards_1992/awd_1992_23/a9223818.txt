Abstract    :
              New firms face a number of performance obstacles created by their              
              newness and small size.  These obstacles include lack of                       
              legitimacy in the industry and marketplace, the challenge of                   
              raising sufficient capital, and the risks and uncertainties of                 
              new technology development.  Yet, some entrepreneurs transform                 
              these obstacles into opportunities by using their newness, small               
              size, and cutting edge technologies to attract other firms in                  
              cooperative relationships, called strategic alliances.  The                    
              strategy of allying with other organizations has become                        
              increasingly prevalent, and yet little is known about the                      
              objective value of such relationships to new ventures.                         
              Using a longitudinal data base on a population of 102 new                      
              ventures in the U.S. semiconductor industry which have created                 
              635 strategic alliances with other firms, this research tests a                
              model of financial performance and strategic alliances.  Among                 
              the variables to be investigated in the research as factors                    
              affecting financial performance are: (1) alliance partner                      
              attributes such as relative power, cultural distance, and                      
              prominence; (2) the number and type of strategic alliances                     
              formed; (3) technological innovativeness; (4) strength of the                  
              founding top management team; (5) organizational resources like                
              investment capital raised; and (6) broader market conditions.
