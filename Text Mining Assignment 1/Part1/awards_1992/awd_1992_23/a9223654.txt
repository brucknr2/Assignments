Abstract    :
              This award supports an integrated research project to                          
              develop chronostratigraphic and paleoenvironmental records                     
              of the continental shelves of the Chukchi and Bering Seas,                     
              off northwestern Alaska.  The project will focus on the                        
              paleontology of peat layers in late Pleistocene terrestrial                    
              and marginal marine (marsh) sediments from existing cores.                     
              Development of these records will involve an integrated                        
              study of insects, pollen, plant macrofossils, ostracods, and                   
              foraminifera.  The goal of this project is to understand the                   
              Pleistocene paleoecology and the inundation history of the                     
              Bering land bridge.  In addition to providing a better                         
              understanding of Pleistocene paleoenvironmental conditions,                    
              the results of this work have implications for                                 
              paleoclimatology, through improved records of sea level                        
              change, and anthropology, through a better chronology and                      
              understanding of the Bering land bridge.
