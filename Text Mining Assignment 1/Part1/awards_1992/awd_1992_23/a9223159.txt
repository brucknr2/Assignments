Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Anyone who has ever tried to learn to play a musical instrument has            
              had the experience of feeling "all thumbs".  With practice, one                
              becomes more skilled, but it is always difficult to conceptualize              
              what one has actually learned.  What is the difference between                 
              skilled and unskilled motor behavior?  Dr. Kruger, and his                     
              colleagues, a physicist and a musician, with the help of two                   
              undergraduate research assistants, will identify differences in                
              wrist and elbow movements between skilled and unskilled trombone               
              players.  They will use sophisticated biomechanical recording                  
              equipment to determine the relative influence of kinesthetic,                  
              visual and auditory feedback on motor control.  This work will                 
              contribute to increased understanding of movement related injuries             
              and improved teaching methods for musicians and athletes.  This                
              grant will also establish a model for teaching interdisciplinary               
              research skills at the undergraduate level.***//
