Abstract    :
                   Collisions of atoms at very low temperatures are                          
              investigated using close-coupling methods and other more novel                 
              approaches for excited state interactions.  The dissipative                    
              effects of spontaneous emission, unimportant in collisions at                  
              ordinary temperatures, play a major and as yet not well                        
              understood role in these ultracold processes.  New theoretical                 
              approaches using the Liouville equation will be used to treat                  
              the excited state collisions in the presence of the laser                      
              field.  The subject of ultracold atomic collisions is under                    
              active experimental study both here in the U.S. and abroad.
