Abstract    :
              9223209  Huebert         This project includes the study of the nitrogen and
              sulfur  cycles in the troposphere, as a way of understanding the impact of 
              nutrients and aerosols on climate.  This work can be divided into  three
              general areas:    (1) The ASTEX/MAGE field program has just been completed. 
              The PIs  group collected a month's worth of filter, impactor, and denuder 
              samples from three platforms:  the R/V Oceanus, Santa Maria Island,  and the
              NCAR Electra.  The sulfate and MSA measurements are  critical to valuating the
              marine sulfur budget, whose evolution was  studied during two Lagrangian
              experiments.  This proposal will  analyze the samples collected, interpret the
              data, test a large  number of hypotheses (related to aerosols, cloud, and
              climate), and  organize workshops and joint publications among the ASTEX/MAGE
              PIs.   The goal for this ASTEX/MAGE data is to understand the marine  aerosol
              production and removal systems well enough to include them  in predictive
              models of marine aerosols, CCN, clouds, atmospheric  radiative properties, and
              climate.    (2)  This proposal will continue a series of nitric acid 
              measurements at Mauna Loa.  The suggestion in data of a multi-year  cycle in
              nitric acid implies that the delivery of new fixed  nitrogen to the remote
              oceans may depend on long-term  climatological changes in precipitation and
              transport patterns.   The PIs long-term aerososl record will also help in
              understanding  the global impact of Pinatubo-derived sulfate aerosol.    (3)
              This proposal will continue an active role in IGAC activities,  including the
              planning and execution of a major international  southern-hemisphere aerosol
              experiment in 1994 or 1995.  ***
