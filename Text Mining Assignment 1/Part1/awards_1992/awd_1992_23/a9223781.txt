Abstract    :
              The purpose of this research is to analyze health and nutrition                
              status in the Western Hemisphere from pre-Columbian times to the               
              early twentieth century using skeletal data.  The skeletal                     
              evidence from 10,000 to 15,000 individuals at 100 to 200 cites                 
              will be complied into a common format and summarized in an index               
              of biological standard of living, which incorporates an                        
              individual's length of life and biological quality of life.                    
              Research will be conducted by 17 interdisciplinary teams that                  
              will use a common methodology and gain interdisciplinary                       
              understanding at a conference to be held at Ohio State                         
              University.  A major purpose of the conference is to reach                     
              agreement on data reporting protocols, which assure that all data              
              are in a form suitable for coding and comparative analysis, and                
              it will include seminars on methods of skeletal biology for                    
              economic historians and seminars on issues in economic history                 
              for bioarcheologists.  The teams will prepare reports on the                   
              health and nutrition of particular regions, time periods, or                   
              ethnic groups.  Tabulations of the index and related measures                  
              will be made available to the teams as ingredients in reports                  
              that will test alternative hypotheses concerning the biological                
              impact of socioeconomic change.  The project is important because              
              it will develop new methods for analyzing and understanding                    
              changes in long-term economic well being.
