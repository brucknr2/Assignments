Abstract    :
              Evolutionary biology has always been controversial:  in Darwin's               
              time, there was the famous debate in Britain between Bishop "Soapy             
              Sam" Wilburforce and Thomas Huxley;  at the turn of the century,               
              there was the Skopes "monkey" trial in the US;  and today, there               
              have been efforts in, for example, Louisiana to require that                   
              "creationism" be taught alongside the "theory" of evolution.  Yet              
              the most serious attacks on Darwin's theory came not from religion             
              but from science itself.  In the 19th century, physicists led by               
              Lord Kelvin argued that the earth was too "young" to have allowed              
              enough time for evolution to have occurred.  With the discovery of             
              natural radiation, however, the age of the earth was greatly                   
              increased to several billions of years--old enough for evolution to            
              occur.  But where physics failed, Mendelian and population genetics            
              stepped in with a scientific assault on Darwin's principle of                  
              natural selection.  It wasn't until the late 1930's and 1940's that            
              evolutionary biology was reconciled with genetics.  The first                  
              person to propose this synthesis was Theodosius Dobzhansky (1900-              
              1975) in his Genetics and the Origin of Species, (1937).  With the             
              collapse of the Soviet Union and the opening of the Russian                    
              archives to Western scholars, Dr. Mark Adams is undertaking the                
              first full-scale study of this founder of modern Western population            
              genetics.                                                                      
                                                                                             
              Dr. Adams is focussing his study of Dobzhansky on the period 1900              
              to 1937 when "Dobbie" published his book launching the evolutionary            
              biology synthesis.  He is also pursuing the persistent Russian                 
              dimension of Dobbie's work even after he moved to the United States            
              (1927).  Dr. Adams aims to clarify the influence of the Kiev school            
              of cytogenetics on Dobzhansky's chromosomal work (1914-1924); the              
              views of his Petersburg mentor, Filipchenko, on his approach to                
              micro- and macroevolution, and on his social views (1924-27) the               
              influence of Russian entomological traditions on his approach to               
              populations, species, and field practice; his gradual assimilation             
              of the conventions and practices of T. H. Morgan's laboratory when             
              he came to the United States; the influence of his Russian                     
              background on the writing of his evolutionary classic; his role in             
              supporting Russian geneticists and opposing Lysenkoism during the              
              period 1937-1960; and the abiding influence of his formative                   
              Russian years in shaping the worldview that informed both his                  
              research and writings on heredity, society, cosmology, and the                 
              human conditions, 1960-1974.
