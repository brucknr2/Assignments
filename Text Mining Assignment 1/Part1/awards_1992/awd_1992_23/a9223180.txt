Abstract    :
              There has long been a controversy over the impact of immigration               
              on the United States economy.  In the North the influx of                      
              migrants in the early 19th century created downward pressures on               
              urban wages, mitigated only by the frontier which provided a                   
              safety valve for the existing wage earners who moved there to                  
              escape the lack of opportunity in the coastal cities.  At the                  
              same time many immigrants moved directly to the less settled                   
              regions increasing national output.  For the South during the                  
              Antebellum period there is great controversy regarding the                     
              geographic and economic mobility of international immigrants.                  
              The purpose of this research is to analyze the internal migration              
              behavior of international immigration to New Orleans, the major                
              port of entry in the South.  Migration behavior will be                        
              investigated by developing a sample of foreign passengers                      
              arriving at New Orleans in 1849 and tracing the location and                   
              economic fortunes of these passengers in 1850 and 1860 using the               
              manuscript census of population and indexes to those censuses.                 
              This research is important because it will shed light on the role              
              immigration played in the economic development of the United                   
              States.
