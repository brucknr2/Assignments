Abstract    :
              9223053  Doak  Professor Doak will develop a novel method to measure atomic 
              integral scattering cross sections in collisions between two  atomic beams down
              to collision velocities as low as 5 meters per  second.  A diffracting,
              single-crystal surface will be employed  in the roll of a "beam-splitter" to
              combine and exactly co-align  the two atomic beams.  Integral cross section
              measurements at  ultra-low collision energies will open an entirely new window
              on  atom-atom interaction, supplying accurate information on orbiting 
              resonances and resonances associated with marginally bound  dimers.  ***
