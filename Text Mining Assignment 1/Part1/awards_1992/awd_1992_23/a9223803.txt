Abstract    :
              9223803  Hodges  An animation sequence may be thought of as a series of images 
              (frames) sampled from a continuously changing scene.  The  temporal sampling
              rate is high, 24-30 frames per second, so that  any particular frame is usually
              very similar to the frame that  preceded and succeeded it.  This similarity is
              known as frame-to-  frame or temporal coherence.  The majority of computer
              graphics  images are generated as part of a sequence of animation frames.  The
              usual approach for producing these images, however, is to  render each frame in
              an animation as if it were a single,  isolated image.    The purpose of this
              research is to develop faster algorithms for  the generation of animated
              sequences of ray-traced images by  exploiting temporal coherence.  The idea
              here is that the  information gained when ray-tracing a particular frame in a 
              sequence may be used to speed up the ray-tracing of other nearby  frames.  the
              goal of this project is the development of efficient  algorithms to infer the
              pixel values of one or more animation  frames from a ray-traced reference
              frame.  The reference frame  may have been fully ray-traced or contain a
              combination of ray-  traced and inferred pixel values.  ***
