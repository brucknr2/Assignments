Abstract    :
              9223759  Gibson       PI will study the taxonomy, biostratigraphy, and
              paleoecology  of macroinvertebrates in the Pennsylvanian-age Mary Lee coal zone
               (especially the Morris shale), Black Warrior basin.  Sections will  be
              described and sampled, fauna described, and biostratigraphic and  biogeographic
              ranges determined.  Paleocommunity and facies  analyses will produce a
              bed-by-bed reconstruction of depositional  environments for the Morris shale,
              to reconstruct vertical shifts  in paleoenvironments and test tectonic-eustatic
              models for the  Black Warrior basin.  In this RUI investigation, a number of 
              undergraduates will be actively involved in field and laboratory  aspects of
              the work.
