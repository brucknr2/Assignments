Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This research will examine the behavior of prices in economies in              
              which individuals have asymmetric information.  Price formation                
              will be carefully modeled in static and overlapping generation                 
              economies where agents may acquire information concerning the                  
              dividend process of risky assets.  Preliminary investigations                  
              indicate that asymmetries in information can lead prices to be more            
              volatile than the underlying dividend stream, and can result in                
              returns which are larger than those predicted by more standard                 
              symmetric information models.  Thus, asymmetric information offers             
              an explanation for the excess volatility and equity premium puzzles            
              discussed in the literature.  The research will take a close look              
              at how the behavior of prices depends on the particular information            
              structure as well as a number of other factors including: the                  
              specification of trading rules, risk aversion, costs of obtaining              
              information, and the size of the economy.
