                  9223819 Thomsen There is increasing social and scientific attention to
              ethical issues arising in the undertaking of scientific research and in its
              social impact.  This workshop brings together interested and knowledgeable
              persons from a wide range of backgrounds to facilitate the development of
              undergraduate course material dealing with ethical issues in physics.  These
              issues involve interactions within the physics community (such as those related
              to the publication process and research standards) as well as between
              physicists and society (such as those related to the role of physicists as
              technical advisors and the impact of physics research on society).  Workshop
              participants will identify topics suitable for course modules, ethical issues
              or problems associated with the topics, and relevant bibliography and key
              references for classroom use.  Results will include a publication detailing the
              results of the workshop and shorter papers for relevant physics journals.  This
              effort lays the groundwork for further proposals to develop the course modules
              and related activities. ***
