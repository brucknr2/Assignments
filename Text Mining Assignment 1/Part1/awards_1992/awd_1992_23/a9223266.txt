Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                                                                                            
              This workshop will consider how two complex ecosystems function, in            
              particular how they fluctuate in response to change, and how                   
              interactions between these systems vary over time as a result of               
              such fluctuations in the individual systems.  The systems to be                
              addressed will be (1) high-latitude forest/river ecosystems and (2)            
              coastal upwelling systems.  Interactions between these systems and             
              arid zones will also be examined on a preliminary basis.  The                  
              workshop will focus on regions where these systems exist along the             
              west coasts of North and South America.  Preliminary comparisons               
              will also be made with analogous ecosystems in the Southwest                   
              Pacific.  The primary system functions to be analyzed will be                  
              biodiversity and biogeochemistry.  Special attention will be paid              
              to human impact on these functions, as well as on the overall                  
              ecosystems.  The results of the workshop will provide input to                 
              ongoing development of a scientific agenda for the Inter-American              
              Institute for Global Change Research (IAI).
