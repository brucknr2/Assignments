Abstract    :
              Dr. Wayne L. Gladfelter of the Chemistry Department, University                
              of Minnesota, will investigate the mechanisms of                               
              metal-catalyzed carbonylations of organic compounds.  Support                  
              for this Environmentally Benign Chemical Synthesis and                         
              Processing project will be provided by the Inorganic,                          
              Bioinorganic, and Organometallic Chemistry program.  Gladfelter                
              will collaborate with Dr. John Grate of Catalytica.  In situ IR                
              and NMR methods will be used to monitor carbonylation reactions                
              of nitroaromatics to form isocyanates.  The catalyst precursors                
              will be Ru3(CO)12 and various ruthenium carbonyls having                       
              phosphine and phosphite ligands.  The pertinence of the work to                
              Environmentally Benign Synthesis is that the reactions afford a                
              method to bypass the use of phosgene (a hazardous intermediate)                
              in the synthesis of isocyanates.  Additional studies will focus                
              on the use of these and related catalysts in asymmetric                        
              synthesis and hydrogenation of polar compounds.                                
              %%%                                                                            
              Polyurethanes are produced in great quantity in the chemical                   
              industry, especially in the production of insulation.  The                     
              present route to polyurethanes entails the conversion of                       
              nitroaromatic to isocyanate compounds with a highly toxic                      
              species, phosgene, being used in great amounts during this                     
              conversion.  A new catalytic method that bypasses the use of                   
              phosgene is to be studied.  At present the method shows great                  
              promise, but much needs to be learned about how it functions.                  
              Catalytica is a California-based company that creates and                      
              commercializes economic and environmentally advantageous                       
              catalytic technologies for the petroleum refining, energy, and                 
              chemical industries.
