Abstract    :
                   The US economy boomed in the 1980s as both employment                     
              and real per capita income increased, but the gains from                       
              this expansion were distributed unevenly across families,                      
              workers, and geographic regions.  Current explanations of                      
              rising disparities in earnings or income involve changes in                    
              labor market conditions, and US metropolitan areas provide a                   
              suitable level of geographic scale at which changes in local                   
              economic, demographic, and political characteristics can be                    
              examined for their effects on income distribution.  Recent                     
              research on income disparity has concentrated either on                        
              regional differences or on national differences between                        
              persons and families.  Until now, there has been little                        
              overlap between these two approaches.  The research                            
              conducted under this award will quantify both the levels of                    
              and changes in the equality of income and earnings                             
              distributions within U.S. metropolitan areas for the decade                    
              of the 1980s.  It will attempt to isolate the effects of                       
              industrial structure, population and labor force                               
              characteristics, growth rates, unionization levels, and                        
              public sector investment on differences in income and                          
              earnings within metropolitan areas and on changes between                      
              metropolitan areas between 1979 and 1991.  Data will come                      
              from the Public Use Microdata Samples (PUMS) of the 1980 and                   
              1990 Censuses of Population, and a series of quantitative                      
              models will assess the effects of the various metropolitan                     
              areas characteristics on incomes and earnings.                                 
                   The causes of increasing disparities in incomes and                       
              earnings remain the subject of intense controversy.  This                      
              research will advance our understanding of the causes of                       
              income inequality across persons and families and by region.                   
              The results should be of use to both scholars and policy                       
              makers interested in finding out what causes income                            
              inequality at local and regional levels.
