Abstract    :
                    The ability to plan, control and predict software  processes is
              facilitated by the measurement of software  development artifacts, even though
              construction of  quantitative models from these artifacts is a difficult task. 
              Explanatory variables are potentially numerous and  heterogeneous; data sets
              are replete with outliers; the  quality of the data collection may be
              questionable; and often  only partial information is available for building the
              model.  Even so, there is a need for customized modelling techniques, 
              procedures, and tools to facilitate the construction of local  tools within a
              specific development environment.  Stochastic modelling is needed for three
              kinds of  activity within the development process:  planning, monitoring  and
              control, and post-mortem analysis and evaluation.  Models  are used to enable
              managers to plan and to take corrective  actions to meet budget, schedule and
              quality requirements.  This research is aimed at continuing the development of 
              an approach called Optimized Set Reduction with the aim of  addressing the
              specific constraints and needs of software  engineering.
