              Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution (WHOI) requests funding to                
              purchase shipboard instrumentation in support of NSF-funded                    
              research.  The instruments will be used aboard the research vessels            
              operated by WHOI, including the KNORR, OCEANUS, and ATLANTIS II.               
              All of the instruments are for shared-use by a wide variety of                 
              scientists.
