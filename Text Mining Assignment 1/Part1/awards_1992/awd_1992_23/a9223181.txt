Abstract    :
                   The objective of this research is to study the applicability              
              of the theory of chaos to machine tools monitoring with specific               
              reference to the metal cutting process.  The research strives to               
              develop formalisms for monitoring via the theory of chaos and                  
              integrate these formalisms with neural networks so that effective,             
              practical monitoring systems can be installed on the shop floor.               
                   The focus of the research is completely tangential to the                 
              conventional thinking on sensor data fusion in monitoring.  It is              
              a very novel attempt to bridge the gap between "hard" manufacturing            
              process issues and "soft" manufacturing information issues using               
              an analytical approach with great potential for serving as an                  
              integration element between these two domains.
