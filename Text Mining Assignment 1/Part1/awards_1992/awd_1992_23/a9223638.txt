Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              After a long period of relative prosperity, American state                     
              governments have recently been experiencing significant fiscal                 
              difficulties.  Ten states began their 1992 fiscal year without a               
              budget, including New York, which set a record by going over three             
              months past its April 1 deadline before adopting a budget, and                 
              Maine and Connecticut, which temporarily shut down all but                     
              essential public services.  Some observers blame this pattern on               
              excessive spending by state governments in the 1980s, while others             
              argue that the "new federalism" is to blame, by increasing state               
              responsibilities while decreasing federal revenue contributions.               
              The investigators believe there is also a political cause:  of the             
              ten states that lacked a budget at the beginning of their 1992                 
              fiscal year, nine currently had divided government, meaning that               
              the same party did not control the executive and both houses of the            
              legislature.  The investigators of this project contend there is               
              also a constitutional cause:  states whose laws allow easy                     
              carryover of deficits accumulate debt faster than others.                      
                                                                                             
              The investigators will use political and economic models to explain            
              how fiscal imbalance in the states results from such political and             
              legal causes.  They will test whether America's parties really                 
              differ systematically in fiscal policy at the state level, with                
              Democrats taxing and spending more.  If so, they will also test                
              whether Democratic states with no-carryover constitutional                     
              provisions act like Republican states, while Democratic states                 
              without such provisions amass large cumulative deficits.  Most of              
              all, the researchers seek to explain how divided government                    
              exacerbates budget deficits in recessions.                                     
                                                                                             
              This research promises to enhance our understanding of the impact              
              of divided government on political and economic factors.
