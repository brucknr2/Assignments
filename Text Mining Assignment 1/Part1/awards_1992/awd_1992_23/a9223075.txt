Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This study addresses questions concerning the comparative use of               
              just-in-time (JIT) production philosophy in the United States and              
              Mexico.  Earlier research identified obstacles to the application              
              of JIT in varying social and economic cultures.  The goal of this              
              project is twofold:  (1).  How do potential obstacles affect a                 
              company's ability to use and achieve the benefits of JIT, and (2).             
              Does JIT lead to improved performance in non-US settings.  In order            
              to address these questions, a model of JIT and hypotheses                      
              concerning potential obstacles was developed.  Case studies of                 
              plants in the United States and Mexico that are moving towards                 
              adoptions of JIT will be used to test the hypotheses.  Data will be            
              collected through interviews, observations, and surveys                        
              administered to workers and managers in each plant.  Results should            
              enhance understanding of how the operating environment affects                 
              operations in general and should lead to a better understanding of             
              JIT because of the unique perspectives that can be achieved by                 
              studying it in diverse environments.  The research should benefit              
              firms doing business in different cultures and environments.  The              
              project is funded as a Doctoral Dissertation Improvement Grant.
