Abstract    :
              This project is in the general area of analytical and surface                  
              chemistry and in the subfield of mass spectrometry.  During the                
              tenure of this three-year continuing grant, Professor Russell and              
              his students will apply matrix assisted laser desorption                       
              ionization Fourier transform mass spectrometry (MALDI/FTMS) to the             
              development of techniques to investigate the structure and                     
              reactivity of large biomolecules.  This research, which builds                 
              upon results obtained under the aegis of NSF grant CHE-8821780,                
              seeks to find a method for inducing sequence-specific cleavage of              
              polypeptide and polynucleotide ions.  A primary focus of Professor             
              Russell's efforts centers around the use of excited state gas                  
              phase metal ions as a means to cause these large biomolecules of               
              interest to fragment selectively.

              The successful attainment of the goals of this research would                  
              provide a facile method for the rapid determination of structures              
              of complex peptides and nucleic acids in the femtomole                         
              concentration regime.  Such analytical methods are of extreme                  
              importance to advances in biotechnology and clinical chemistry.
