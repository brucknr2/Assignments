              Abstract  ATM-9223114  Nitrouer, Charles A.  State University of New York at
              Stonybrook  Title: Flux and Fate of Sediment and Water from Small, Mountainous 
              Rivers to the Continental Margin: The Gulf of Alaska Example    Small rivers
              charging directly from mountains into the ocean carry  greater sediment loads
              than commonly envisioned, a relatively great  percentage of which may escape to
              deeper waters during high stands  of sea level.  This award supports a study of
              the flux of Holocene  fluvial sediment into the Gulf of Alaska, whose generally
              small  tributary rivers are collectively the largest supplier of sediment  from
              North America.  Alaskan rivers are relatively uninfluenced by  human
              activities, although glacial activity has resulted in higher  sediment yields
              than noted for other rivers with similar drainage  areas.    High-resolution
              seismic profiling, in conjunction with seismic data  previously collected, will
              allow the identification of sediment  accumulation and discharge patterns on
              the shelf and slope, as well  as trace individual sediment layers derived from
              episodic (flood)  events.  Sedimentological data will help define the escape 
              routes/processes, and a variety of radiometric datings will show  frequency of
              occurrence and rates of accumulation.  Facies will be  defined by compositional
              and textural analyses, as will be sources  (and fates) of terrigneous grains
              and organic matter in shelf  sediments.  Measurements of total organic carbon
              and total  nitrogen, d13C, d15N, and lignin oxidation productions in sediment 
              organic matter will be used to determine the amount and source of  organic
              matter accumulating in the sediments.    Contemporaneous oceanographic
              processes controlling strata  formation will also be evaluated.  This
              information should help in  the interpretation of the older strata observed by
              seismic  profiling and coring.
