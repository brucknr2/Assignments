Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Researchers agree that new firm creation is a process, not an                  
              event.  However, little is known about the formation stage when                
              individuals first assemble properties needed to form viable                    
              economic entities.  By not attending to this formation stage,                  
              researchers risk overlooking characteristics of sub-populations                
              especially susceptible to early extinction.  Women-owned                       
              businesses may represent one such group.  The objective of this                
              Research Planning Grant is to determine how organizations come                 
              into existence, and ascertain ways the gestation process may vary              
              by factors such as gender of the founding entrepreneur.  Besides               
              contributing to theory development, findings from the proposed                 
              research have the potential for impacting public policy regarding              
              the development of women-owned businesses.  Business starts among              
              women far outpace those of men, yet women seemingly still face                 
              significant economic and social barriers.  Activities proposed                 
              for the planning grant period will: (a) provide insight into the               
              causal processes underlying new firm gestation; (b) develop ways               
              to assess those processes; and (c) resolve methodological issues               
              that currently impede researchers in studying the formation                    
              stage.  Principal among the activities is the analysis of data on              
              entrepreneurs collected during a statewise survey.  The                        
              investigator was co-principal investigator on this project.  The               
              planning grant would support further development of this research              
              stream and the investigator's career development.
