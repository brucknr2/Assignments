Abstract    :
              9223088  Davis       The principal investigator will work on the development of 
              parallel alllgorithms, tools, and data structures for large  irregular problems
              arising in computational science.  The  solution of large, sparse, unsymmetric
              systems of equations is an  an example  of one such problem.  It forms a
              critical componment  of many solutions to scientific problems, and yet has an 
              irregular nature that limits its performance on a wide range of  current high
              performance computers:  parallel-vector shared-  memory computers (i.e., Cray),
              distributed-memory computers  (i.e., Ncube, Intl), and pipelined, RISC-based
              workstations  (i.e., IBM RS/6000, SUN SParc/10).  All of these computers have a
               complexx memory hierarchy to take advantage of the regular memory  addressing
              patterns that are present in many scientific codes.   This regular pattern is
              not presentin typical factorization  algorithms for unsymmatic sparse matrices.
                    Addressing this problem will require the use of dense matrix  kernels
              with regular memory addressing behavior, and high-  performamce cocurrent data
              structures that allow the remaining  irregular behavior to be carried out in as
              an efficient manner as  possible.  ***
