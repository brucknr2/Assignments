Abstract    :
              Employers use different recruiting mechanisms that can be                      
              classified in two broad categories.  For some jobs, firms hire                 
              the first qualified person to show up once a job becomes vacant.               
              This generally ensures that the worker will accept the job if it               
              is offered.  For other jobs, employers engage in a more time                   
              consuming process, often accepting initial applications through                
              the mail.  This means that applicants are more likely to get                   
              alternative offers during the period that applications are                     
              reviewed and may turn down a job offer.  The purpose of this                   
              research is to analyze the economic effects of costly employer                 
              search under these two institutional frameworks.  The project has              
              three objectives.  The first is to strengthen our theoretical                  
              understanding of employer search by extending existing models to               
              account for worker heterogeneity and dynamic considerations.  The              
              second is to the analyze the effects of certain labor market                   
              policies like minimum wage laws, the immigration of unskilled                  
              workers, and unemployment insurance in the context of the                      
              extended theoretical models.  Finally, the models are tested by                
              examining their implications for job-advertising.  This research               
              is important because it will shed new insights into the job                    
              matching process.
