Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Duke University requests funding to purchase shipboard                         
              instrumentation in support of NSF-funded research. The instruments             
              will be used aboard the R/V CAPE HATTTERAS, a 135 foot vessel,                 
              which is owned by NSF and operated by the University.  The PI                  
              requested funding to purchase a computer, replacement Niskin                   
              bottles, and a scintillation counter.  The instrumentation                     
              requested will be used aboard the R/V CAPE HATTERAS in support of              
              193 days of NSF-funded scientific research in 1993.
