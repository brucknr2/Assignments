Abstract    :
              This project continues experimental research on institutions that              
              may offer an appropriate framework for negotiating solutions to                
              externality problems such as global warming, pollution control,                
              and common resources.  The institutions, known as compensation                 
              mechanisms, yield efficient outcomes for most externalities                    
              problems of interest to economists.  They also have attractive                 
              distributional characteristics in that they yield allocations                  
              that are competitive equilibria with the externalities priced at               
              marginal cost.                                                                 
                                                                                             
              This project investigates experimentally the performance of                    
              different compensation mechanisms for two-party unilateral                     
              externalities, public goods, general externalities structures,                 
              commons problems, and congestion problems.  The experiments are                
              run both with and without full information.  The project also                  
              develops and disseminates a computer environment for NeXT                      
              workstations that captures the logical structure for all                       
              externalities problems.  As a consequence the same computer                    
              program can be used for all experimental work on externalities -               
              just the user interface and the payoff structure will change.
