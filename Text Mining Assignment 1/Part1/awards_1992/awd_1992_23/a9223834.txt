Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The retina of the eye contains may classes of nerve cells besides              
              just the photoreceptors.  These cells participate in networks that             
              utilize a variety of neurotransmitter compounds for communication              
              and modulation of the cellular responses.  An important transmitter            
              is dopamine, and goldfish provide a retina where one class of cells            
              produces dopamine.   Other important neuroactive compounds are the             
              peptides, which often in other networks are modulators of neural               
              activity.  This project uses biochemistry, pharmacology, and                   
              microscopic anatomy on the goldfish retina as a model to examine               
              the circuits formed by the cells utilizing these compounds.  The               
              goldfish retina has provided extensive data on the presence of                 
              these compounds, but their functions are largely unknown; this                 
              study will clarify their functional role in transmission and                   
              modulation of signals in the visual pathway.   Because of the                  
              widespread occurrence of these compounds elsewhere in the brain,               
              this work on the goldfish retina not only provides a useful model              
              system for increasing our understanding of visual processing, but              
              also will have impact on neuroscience in general.
