Abstract    :
              9223070  Zachos    This is an equipment grant, to assist in purchase of a stable
               isotope mass spectrometer for analysis of oxygen and carbon  isotopes in
              calcareous material. Data will be used to infer changes  in ocean temperature
              and salinity, productivity, and watermass    properties for past climatic
              conditions, including the glacial  periods and the warm early Cenozoic. Two
              young faculty members,  both with prior experience and with excellent
              credentials, will  operate the machine, which will be available to other
              faculty  members from two departments.
