Abstract    :
              Most interesting questions in macroeconomics concern the behavior              
              of unobservables; they become answerable only if they are couched              
              in terms of structural models.  To use data to evaluate the                    
              model, researchers require identifying assumptions which come                  
              from outside the model.  The recent direction taken in                         
              macroeconomics has been to develop a structural model and ignore               
              many observed relationships among US macroeconomic variables or                
              to analyze macroeconomic data with little regard for economic                  
              theory.  In many cases, the necessary identifying assumptions are              
              never made explicit.  This project develops a new methodology for              
              estimating and analyzing dynamic, stochastic, general equilibrium              
              macroeconomic models.  The methodology involves expanding the                  
              stochastic rank of the model and imposing enough restrictions on               
              the model so that is just-identified.  The technique permits the               
              analysis of models which fit all statistical relationships in the              
              data set.  Models with a limited number of shocks cannot do this.              
              Unlike most current analyses of macroeconomic models, it does not              
              require unnecessary ad hoc restrictions in the model.  The                     
              questions studied using this new methodology include:  Is the                  
              slowdown in the growth rate of measured productivity since 1973                
              due to changes in actual productivity or due to an increase in                 
              the growth rate of (unobservable) quality of goods?  Is there a                
              stable money demand function?  How does the presence of an                     
              underground economy affect the choice of optimal monetary                      
              policies?                                                                      
                                                                                             
              The productivity slowdown of the past two decades has been well-               
              documented.  Productivity growth declines from 2.9% over the                   
              period 1957 to 1973 to an average of 0.5% since 1973.  This has                
              been explained as due to the rise in oil prices in the early                   
              1970s, a decline in technological progress, or a measurement                   
              error caused by a failure to adjust adequately for the higher                  
              quality of outputs.  The methodology developed in this project                 
              can be used to distinguish among these explanations.  The                      
              importance of the oil price shock is analyzed by examining the                 
              obsolescence of the capital stock and the 1973 price hike, the                 
              later, lesser increase in 1979, and the disintegration of OPEC                 
              during the 1980s.
