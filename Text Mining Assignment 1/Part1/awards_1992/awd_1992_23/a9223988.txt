Abstract    :
              This is one of four coordinated projects that will make use of the             
              camp facilities established on the ice sheet in the interior of                
              Greenland as part of the GISP-2 ice core drilling effort, in order             
              to investigate how atmospheric trace elements are deposited on the             
              ice and what kind of changes they undergo as they are being                    
              incorporated into the ice.  An understanding of such processes is              
              necessary in order to properly interpret the proxy climate data                
              that can be recovered from ice cores.  While significant progress              
              has been made recently in extracting and analyzing ice cores,                  
              progress in understanding the air to snow transfer process for                 
              reactive chemical species has lagged behind.                                   
                                                                                             
              The major goal of this project is to understand the reasons for                
              changes in the composition of snow at or near the surface of the               
              Greenland ice sheet that are observed to occur within days or weeks            
              after deposition.  It is known that the concentration of soluble               
              ionic species and aerosol-associated species may change rapidly                
              with time, but the variability may be masked by small-scale spatial            
              heterogeneity.  A sampling protocol will be set up to characterize             
              the spatial variability on the one meter to one kilometer scale.               
                                                                                             
              Beryllium-7, a naturally-occurring radionuclide that is formed in              
              the stratosphere, will be used as an indicator for small aerosol               
              particles.  Its close association with atmospheric particulates and            
              half-life of 53 days make it a useful tracer of the incorporation              
              of aerosols in the snow and their post-depositional redistribution             
              within the snowpack
