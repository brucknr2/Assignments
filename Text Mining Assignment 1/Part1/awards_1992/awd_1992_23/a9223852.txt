              Scripps Institute of Oceanography (SIO) requests funding to                    
              purchase shipboard instrumentation in support of NSF-funded                    
              research.  The instruments will be used aboard the research vessels            
              operated by SIO, including the MELVILLE, NEW HORIZON and SPROUL.               
              All of the instruments are for shared-use by a wide variety of                 
              scientists.  Instrumentation to be purchased include differential              
              GPS systems for the MELVILLE and the NEW HORIZON, computer upgrades            
              for all the ships, upgraded airguns, spare parts for the oxygen                
              autotitrator systems and coloimeters, altimeters, salinometers,                
              temperature probes and one 36-place rosette for WOCE cruises.
