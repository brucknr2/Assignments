Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Several areas of research in organosilicon, organoaluminum, and                
              organoboron chemistry will be pursued, which include: (1) Gas-phase            
              ion-molecule chemistry to prepare and study the reactivity and                 
              thermochemistry of a number of low-, normal-, and high-valent                  
              silicon, aluminum, and boron containing anions. Triple quadrupole              
              collisionally-induced dissociation (CID) will be used to study                 
              thermochemical parameters. (2) Periodic Table relationships and                
              substituent effects of these anions will be investigated. (3)                  
              Relationships between the anions and their corresponding neutrals,             
              which are in general species of enhanced reactivity and of                     
              theoretical interest, will be pursued. (4) Condensed-phase studies             
              will be continued to prepare silicon-containing cages in order to              
              probe inside-outside substituent effects and to generate silicon-              
              carbon bonds from organoboranes.

              This grant from the Organic Dynamics Program supports the                      
              continuing work of Professor Robert Damrauer at the University of              
              Colorado at Denver. The major thrust of the research will be a                 
              study of molecules containing silicon, aluminum, and boron in the              
              gas-phase. The chemistry, thermochemistry, and acidity of these                
              highly reactive species will be determined. Comparisons of these               
              properties will be made between the silicon, aluminum, and boron               
              molecules, based on the Periodic Table of elemental properties.                
              These studies will shed light on technical aspects of the                      
              manufacture of electronic components. Another aspect of the                    
              research will be directed to the study of silicon-containing cage              
              molecules and the generation of silicon-carbon bonds in the                    
              condensed-phase.
