Abstract    :
              In this project Profs. W.R. Gentry and C.F. Giese of the                       
              University of Minnesota will conduct basic research on the                     
              dynamics of molecular energy transfer at temperatures in the                   
              range from 1K to less than 1 mK, and will perform crossed beam                 
              studies of reactions involving hydrogen atoms with methane and                 
              silane molecules, as well as study reactions on weakly bound                   
              clusters.                                                                      
              %%%                                                                            
              Previous studies at extremely low temperatures have been                       
              conducted nearly exclusively in condensed phase systems.  The                  
              present research at ultra low temperatures is devoted to                       
              theinvestigation of phenomena of bimolecular collisions in the                 
              gas phase.  The extremely low kinetic energies are expected to                 
              reveal the highly quantum mechanical nature of the                             
              translational, as well as internal, motions under such                         
              conditions.  The isotopic exchange and substitution reactions                  
              involving hydrogen atoms with methane of silane molecules or                   
              their isotopic variants at elevated temperatures has revealed                  
              unexpected behavior.  The present research under low                           
              temperature beam conditions will provide critical data to                      
              assist in the understanding of these processes.  The work on                   
              cluster reactions is directed toward the understanding of the                  
              elementary dynamics of cluster growth, exchange and metathesis                 
              reactions as function of cluster size, composition, and energy                 
              available.
