Abstract    :
              This is an award to support Phase II of a                                      
              research project, Phase I of which was                                         
              conducted under NSF Grant No. 91-61351.  The                                   
              research is on determining the feasibility of                                  
              using fish ventilatory response profiles in                                    
              an automated monitoring system that can                                        
              continuously detect toxicity of effluents                                      
              from wastewater collection and treatment                                       
              systems.  This concept involves a process by                                   
              which ventilatory and locomotive behavior                                      
              responses of fish are analyzed to determine                                    
              the presence of toxic substances in the                                        
              wastewater to which the fish are exposed and                                   
              to aid in identification of the responsible                                    
              substances.                                                                    
                                                                                             
              The proposal leading to this award was                                         
              submitted in accord with criteria in NSF 91-                                   
              20, Small Business Innovation Research                                         
              (SBIR).  Results of Phase I supported the                                      
              technical feasibility of using fish response                                   
              as the basis for an automated, real-time                                       
              water quality monitoring system to detect the                                  
              presence of toxics in water.  The objective                                    
              of Phase II is to determine the commercial                                     
              feasibility of this concept which could be                                     
              used to continuously monitor wastewater for                                    
              toxics, to screen water for presence of                                        
              toxics and to locate their sources.  A system                                  
              based on this concept could be used to manage                                  
              operation of biological processes used in                                      
              treatment of wastewater.
