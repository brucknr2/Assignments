Abstract    :
              The purpose of this research is to develop models for child care               
              for estimating the effect of regulation on the quality of care                 
              children receive and the price that families, government, and                  
              employers pay for care.  Hedonic models are developed which                    
              provide a means of incorporating the pervasive heterogeneity of                
              child care services.  Knowledge of the effect of regulation on                 
              the price and quality of care is valuable for informing the                    
              public and private debate regarding child care policy and may                  
              allow adoption of child care policies that more efficiently                    
              achieve quality care for children.  To estimate the models,                    
              national data collected by the 1990 National Child Care Survey                 
              and the Profile of Child Care Settings are used.
