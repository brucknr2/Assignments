              research relevant to processing metal alloys                                   
              and composites.  Experts need more and improved                                
              data on this subject.  This research would by                                  
              necessity go beyond routine data generation to                                 
              improve techniques for taking these                                            
              measurements.  Much of the proposal aims to                                    
              improve measuring techniques.
