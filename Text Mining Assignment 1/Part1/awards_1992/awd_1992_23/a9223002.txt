Abstract    :
              The media is filled today with reference to the global economic                
              village, political leaders talk in terms of world                              
              competitiveness, and Americans fear the loss of productivity and               
              living standards.  Economists have come to call this process                   
              convergence, and theory and empirical analysis on post World War               
              II experience with it have flourished.  It is often forgotten,                 
              however, that this process of economic convergence has a very                  
              long history.  It starts in the 19th century following two                     
              important economic events; the discovery New World resources and               
              the industrial revolution.  Both of these events created economic              
              divergence: wage, standard of living and per capita income gaps                
              between members of the current OECD industrialized club increased              
              sharply.  After the 1850's, however, this divergence was followed              
              by more than a century of convergence when poor countries grew                 
              faster than rich countries.  What has been observed since the                  
              1950s, therefore, has been going on since the middle of the last               
              century.                                                                       
                                                                                             
              This process of convergence took place in fits and starts, and                 
              one major goal of this project is to identify which episodes                   
              underwent convergence and why.  A second major objective is to                 
              uncover the forces which caused convergence.  These would include              
              international labor migrations, international capital flows,                   
              international trade, skill formation, and technological advance.               
              War, policy intervention, and other events favoring or                         
              suppressing factor flows and trade are also likely to have played              
              a central role in shaping those forces underlying the                          
              convergence.  A better understanding of these historical forces                
              should provide useful insights about the course of future world-               
              wide economic growth.
