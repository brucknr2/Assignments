Abstract    :
              The Bodega Marine Laboratory of U.C.-Davis will undertake an                   
              instrumentation development project to develop a position-                     
              determining archival tag for monitoring the movements of marine                
              vertebrates.  This small microprocessor-based tag will be equipped             
              with sensors that will store (archive) environmental measurements              
              from which geographical location can be derived.  The work involves            
              the modification of a commercially available tag that is used for              
              terrestrial applications.  Sensors will measure irradiance as a                
              function of time for determining longitude and total geomagnetic               
              field intensity for determining latitude.  Temperature and pressure            
              will also be measured.  Data will be stored in a file and when the             
              tag is retrieved and the data examined, the movements of the tag               
              over time can be determined.   The archival tag has potential                  
              application in studying the migratory patterns of pelagic fish,                
              such as tuna, and marine mammals.  NOAA/National Marine Fisheries              
              Service is collaborating with this project.
