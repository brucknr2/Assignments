Abstract    :
                   In several collisional orogens, uplift of large areas                     
              has accompanied tectonism, forming large plateaus of                           
              anomalously high elevation.  The classic modern example is                     
              the 5,000 in Tibetan Plateau, one of the most extraordinary                    
              irregularities of the earth's surface.  Recent modeling has                    
              underscored the importance of understanding the uplift                         
              history of these plateaus both in understanding the                            
              fundamental tectonic mechanics involved and in understanding                   
              how these uplifts affect atmospheric circulation patterns,                     
              erosion and other derivative parameters.  This project will                    
              employ the altitude-controlled production of 36C1 of                           
              surfaces and radiometric dating of volcanic flows to                           
              constrain the uplift history of the Tibetan Plateau.                           
              Results, if successful, will be invaluable in both                             
              understanding the formation of this plateau and in testing                     
              general orogenic models.
