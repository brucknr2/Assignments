Abstract    :
              This award is for support of a three year investigation to                     
              characterize seismic reflection facies of temperate glaciers in                
              order to help infer climatic, glaciologic and marine conditions                
              associated with the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) advance and                     
              subsequent retreat in Glacier Bay, Alaska.  The study will use the             
              R/V Alpha Helix for collection of data by seismic reflection                   
              profiling, side scan sonar, and piston and gravity coring.  This               
              work will provide critical data for modeling the depositional                  
              systems of glacial grounding lines.  This is a collaborative                   
              research project between Northern Illinois University and                      
              Appalachian State University.
