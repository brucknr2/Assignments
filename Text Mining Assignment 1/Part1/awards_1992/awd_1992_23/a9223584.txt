Abstract    :
              Under an SGER award an attempt will be made to produce                         
              polycrystalline silicon nitride compacts with grain boundary                   
              material which has been engineered to produce compressive                      
              stresses during cooling from the sintering temperature.  It is                 
              expected that the resultant material will have improved wear                   
              resistance.  The approach involves coating of submicron powders                
              in solution, followed by calcination to form a thin, uniform                   
              layer of SiAlON which will become the grain boundary material in               
              solid components compacted from the powder.
