Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Physical Optics Corporation (POC) proposes to develop a polymer-               
              based optical data bus for high-speed interconnections for use in              
              data processing and physical measurement systems.  The proposed                
              concept will provide an optical data bus (ODB) compatible with                 
              widely used module interconnection standar-li (e.g. CAMAC,                     
              FASTBUS, VMEbus) while improving communication speed and                       
              parallelity.  In this program, we propose the use of a high-                   
              speed polymer-based ODB for chip-to-chip, intramodule and module-              
              to-module interconnection.  The two-dimensional tunability of the              
              refractive index of the polymer microstructure provides the                    
              capability to make a microstructured channel waveguide on any                  
              substrate of interest.  This characteristic provides an easy                   
              means of constructing optical backplanes and printed ODB boards                
              for system-wide communication.  Furthermore, the host material                 
              can be used to introduce nonlinear optical moiety in a guest/host              
              polymer system for the highly parallel processing needed for                   
              FASTBUS interconnections.  The proposed polymer ODB should be                  
              immune to EMI and nuclear radiation.  As a result, radiation                   
              hardness should be expected.  In Phases I, POC will demonstrate a              
              board-to-board ODB system through a backplane.  It will have                   
              speed and communication distances beyond any conventional                      
              electronic system-wide interconnections.
