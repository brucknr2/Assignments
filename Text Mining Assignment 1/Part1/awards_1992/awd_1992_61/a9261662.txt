Abstract    :
              This proposal is for developing a VLSI CAD tool to do the process              
              of compacting a wiring design into minimal chip area.  The novelty             
              in this tool is that it seeks to go beyond existing compaction                 
              tools and deal with designs that have millions of transistors,                 
              which is three orders of magnitude beyond current capabilities.                
              The approach relies on the quasi-linearity of the compaction                   
              algorithms already developed.  These topological approaches to                 
              compaction are being developed through parallel computing                      
              techniques and maintaining structural hierarchy.  A coarse grain               
              parallel implementation is being implemented in the C-Linda                    
              language, and it is being tested in distributed environments and               
              on tightly coupled MIMD machines.
