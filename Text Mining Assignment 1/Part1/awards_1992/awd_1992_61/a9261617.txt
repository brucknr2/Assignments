Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              AstroPower proposes the growth and development of a (GaP)1-                    
              x(ZnS)x-based material.  It is the purpose of the proposed work to             
              explore for solid solution compositions of (GaP)1-x(ZnS)x that are             
              amphoteric and characterized by direct bandgaps greater than 2.6               
              eV, and to demonstrate epitaxial growth techniques which have                  
              manufacturing scale potential.  This type of material with bandgap             
              in excess of 2.6 eV can be employed in blue light-emitting diodes,             
              and in UV detectors capable of superior performance compared to                
              silicon, in high temperature, high radiation environments such as              
              in earth orbit and particle accelerators. For a blue LED, the suc-             
              cessful development of this material system is expected to lead to             
              luminous intensities of 80 to 300 mcd compared to the 20 mcd of                
              currently available SiC LEDs.
