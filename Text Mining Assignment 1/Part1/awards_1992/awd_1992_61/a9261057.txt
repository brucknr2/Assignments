Abstract    :
                   Nesting is the process of placing objects together with                   
              minimal void space between them.  Nesting is required in the design            
              and manufacturing of almost every product.  This research will                 
              develop a three dimensional (3D) algorithm for the packaging of                
              irregular 3D objects inside target volumes.  This computer program             
              will automatically pack the maximum number of components possible              
              with minimum wasted volume voids.  An intelligent software driven              
              system for use in the design and manufacturing of any product will             
              be developed that will enable designers to automatically visualize             
              nested layouts as they design; reducing lead time for new product              
              introductions, enhancing communications between design/engineering             
              and manufacturing.                                                             
                  In the computer industry, nesting of the various components is             
              done manually in order to achieve minimum size of the computer box.            
              With this computer program, a designer will be able to quickly                 
              assemble and define a computer geometry from prescribed components             
              and their location constraints.
