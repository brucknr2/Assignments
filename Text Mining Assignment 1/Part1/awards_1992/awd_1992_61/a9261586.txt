Abstract    :
              This project deals with the feasibility of developing a small                  
              modular piezoelectric damping element for application in                       
              vibration suppression of structural dynamic systems, such as                   
              buildings, bridges, automobiles, machines, aircraft, spacecrafts               
              and submarines. It involves material research combined with                    
              device design and control strategy research to discover new                    
              methods of  noise and vibration reduction and control. Key areas               
              of research investigation include low-voltage actuation, control               
              strategy and operational modes, and sensor/actuator/electronics                
              integration and implementation.***//
