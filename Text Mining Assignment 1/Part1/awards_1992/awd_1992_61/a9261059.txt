Abstract    :
              The innovation proposed in this program is a tailored composite                
              sacrificial anode for galvanic cathodic protection systems for                 
              reinforced and prestressed concrete.  This anode system can be                 
              tailored for each application to provide the desired performance               
              characteristics by changing the composition and form of the                    
              finished composite. The composite sacrificial anode will contain               
              all of the necessary components in a single unit, minimizing the               
              need for special installation procedures.  The focus of the                    
              program will be on development and testing of composite sacrificial            
              anodes in aqueous alkaline solution and concrete                               
              environments for galvanic protection of reinforcing steel and                  
              prestressing wires.  The effects of fabrication methods, anode                 
              composition, physical characteristics and form, and concrete                   
              chemistry, resistivity and temperature on galvanic performance will            
              be evaluated.
