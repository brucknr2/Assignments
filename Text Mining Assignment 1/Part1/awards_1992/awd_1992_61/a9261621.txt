Abstract    :
              Efficient acquisition of 3-D surface coordinates would have                    
              obvious utility in machine vision applications such as metrology               
              for quality control, obstacle detection for motion control, and                
              target location for docking.  Yet there is no ubiquitous method                
              for 3-D digitizing.  Extant technologies suffer from a variety of              
              short-coming including near-field blindness, cumbersome                        
              calibration schemes, limited resolution and data rates, weight                 
              and scale penalties, and high cost.  This research explores use                
              of a new method for range finding based on diffraction to develop              
              a new class of 3-D image acquisition devices.  These would be                  
              effective alternatives to available technologies in ranges from                
              tens of microns to meters.  Potential applications cover                       
              microscopy, endoscopy, eye-in-hand cameras for end effectors,                  
              work area surveillance cameras, and production line measurement                
              cameras.
