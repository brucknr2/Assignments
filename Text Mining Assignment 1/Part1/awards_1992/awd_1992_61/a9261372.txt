Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This project is aimed at new coding methods for lower cost                     
              satellite communications.  The project investigates the use of                 
              difference sets in finite fields, and develops algorithms to                   
              clarify the feasibility of ideas.  The PI is programing two                    
              algorithms and analyzing their performance.  The resulting new                 
              sequences are then applied to design of new efficient, low cost                
              CDMA/RMA/FH (Code Division Multiple Access/Random Multiple                     
              Access/Frequency Hopping) system.
