Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Chronic needs for higher materials performance in present and                  
              future commercial and military systems mandate improvements in                 
              materials properties.  High melting point, low density and high                
              strength are among the material properties necessary to achieve                
              future system performance goals.  Such requirements can no longer              
              be met using conventional metal alloys (including aluminum-based               
              alloys which melt at only 660 C).  Magnesium-based intermetallics              
              are among the best candidates to fulfill the aforementioned                    
              requirements.  Based on density, melting point (926 C), crystal                
              structure (B2), and oxidation resistance considerations, an                    
              intermetallic compound MgY has significant potential as a light-               
              weight material for 500 C - 550 C applications.  The Phase I                   
              investigation concentrates on establishing the room and high                   
              temperature mechanical properties of the intermetallic MgY,                    
              improving the room temperature ductility, fracture toughness and               
              elevated temperature strength of the intermetallic.  The Phase I               
              investigation should establish the potential of dispersion-                    
              strengthened MgY for further development under a Phase II program.             
              Unique plasma synthesis processing will be utilized to produce                 
              these magnesium intermetallic alloys with specific strengths higher            
              than heretofore reported.                                                      
                                                                                             
              High strength-to-weight ratio magnesium intermetallic alloys have              
              a high demand in aerospace and transportation applications.                    
              Further, fiber-reinforced composites based on such intermetallic               
              matrices exhibit very high specific properties.
