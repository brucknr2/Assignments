Abstract    :
                   Improvement in the quality, size and cost of indium phosphide             
              (InP) single crystals is necessary in order to realize the high                
              performance benefits of InP-based microwave and millimeter wave                
              monolithic integrated circuit technology.  To meet this need, the              
              project will implement a novel modification to the Vertical                    
              Gradient Freeze (VGF) crystal growth method.  The modification will            
              enhance the VGF technique by enabling active control to be exerted             
              over the defect-inducing thermal stresses that degrade the quality             
              of InP crystals.                                                               
                   The VGF technique is well suited to economical, large-scale               
              production as it combines simplicity of design with low operator               
              attention requirements.  The physical processes of VGF are well                
              understood which forms a solid foundation for the practical                    
              engineering approach.  If the approach proves feasible, development            
              of sources for the desired InP material will be straightforward.
