Abstract    :
              The potential of ceramics and intermetallics for numerous                      
              applications has not been realized due to the lack of sinterable               
              powders which are cost effective and of high purity.  An                       
              innovative technique is proposed to produce SiC, NiA1, Ti-22A1-                
              27Nb, and MoSi2 ultrafine, spherical, and stoichiometric                       
              particles. This method involves vaporization, reaction, and                    
              extremely rapid quenching of the materials to form submicron                   
              particles with a wide range of compositions possible.  The                     
              sinterability of these powders will be evaluated through                       
              pressureless sintering.  An economical projection of the cost                  
              for the scaling up for commercialization of each system will be                
              completed.                                                                     
                                                                                             
              The synthesis of high purity, spherical, ultrafine ceramic and                 
              intermetallic particles will enable production of sinterable                   
              high performance materials, which have applications in heat                    
              engines, a variety of energy conversion systems, aerospace                     
              applications, and military and defense systems.
