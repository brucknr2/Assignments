Abstract    :
              Current luminescence bioassays rely solely upon measurement of                 
              luminescence intensity to generate information.Recent success at               
              Promega's Corporation in producing multiple colors from beetle                 
              luciferases has created the opportunity to greatly increase assay              
              information content by using multiplexing techniques to measure                
              light intensities at different wavelengths.  This could provide                
              greater assay reliability, precision, and ability to measure                   
              concurrent molecular events.  Promega's focus on beetle luciferases            
              stems from the excellent performance of the enzymes in bioassay                
              methods.  The assay of these enzymes, which yields the highest                 
              quantum efficiency of any luminescence methodology, demonstrates               
              superior precision, linearity, and rapidity.  To further assess the            
              feasibility of using multiplexing to increase the commercial                   
              potential of bioluminescence assays.Promega proposes to identify               
              novel substitutions that regulate color by examining the                       
              relationship between amino acid substitutions in the primary                   
              structures of beetle luciferases to the enzymes' spectral                      
              properties.                                                                    
              %%%                                                                            
              Promega anticipates development of the following commercial                    
              applications from this research: advanced genetic reporter systems             
              for molecular biological research, immunoassay, live-cell                      
              biosensors.
