Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Williamson and Associates, Inc. will investigate the feasibility               
              of a remotely operated rock drill with extended coring                         
              capability.  A reliable means of recovering core samples from 10               
              to 50 meters deep in both consolidated and unconsolidated                      
              seafloor materials at water depths to 4000 meters, is needed by                
              university and government research and the offshore oil industry.              
              The overall research objectives are design and test a drilling                 
              system which will extend a successful deep sea 3 meter coring                  
              tool to the greater depths.  The Phase I research is to establish              
              the feasibility of assembling and disassembling drill rods,                    
              coring tools and casing automatically on the sea floor, a                      
              necessary step for deep water use.  When complete, this will be                
              the only device available for obtaining cores at these depths.                 
              The construction and operation of approximately ten of these                   
              systems worldwide is envisioned.
