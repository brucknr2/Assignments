Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              AstroPower proposes to develop gallium phosphide energy                        
              converters optimized for radio luminescent light based power                   
              supplies.  A "two-step" or "indirect" process is used where a                  
              phosphor is excited by radioactive decay products to produce                   
              light that is then converted to electricity by a GaP energy                    
              converter.  This "indirect" energy conversion of B-radiation to                
              electrical energy can be realized by applying recent developments              
              in tritium based radio luminescent (RL) light sources in                       
              combination with the high cell operating voltage than can be                   
              achieved under low illumination with gallium phosphide                         
              photodiodes.  This proposal addresses the development of                       
              semiconductor power converters that are suitable for low activity              
              radioisotope fuels such as tritium (T2).  Tritium has been                     
              neglected in semiconductor conversion due to its low average                   
              energy emission, 5.7 keV, but recent materials advances have                   
              advances have made tritium sources practical sources practical.                
              Tritium has a relatively long half life, a safe decay product, is              
              easily shielded, and is required in only small amounts for                     
              milliwatt power supplies.
