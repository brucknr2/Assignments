Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Liquid crystal materials have a potential for detecting and                    
              visualizing ultrasound images.  However, because of their low                  
              sensitivity, acousto-optical displays that use these materials                 
              have not been pursued for medical imaging applications.                        
                                                                                             
              This research investigates new liquid crystal materials capable                
              of enhanced detection sensitivity of acousto-optical displays by               
              a factor of 10,000.  Underlying physical mechanisms are studied                
              in the acousto-optical interaction, and a foundation is developed              
              for an ultrasonic imaging system for detection of breast cancer.
