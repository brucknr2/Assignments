Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The feasibility of fabricating a YBCO based passive microwave                  
              device with GaAs ICs on a single GaAs wafer by in-situ Pulsed Laser            
              Deposition (PLD), conventional photolithographic patterning and                
              metalization techniques will be developed.  The superconducting                
              properties of the YBCO films to select the best buffer film                    
              material and film deposition process will be evaluated in order to             
              obtain high quality superconductor films.  A simple superconductor             
              stripline filter will be integrated with a GaAs low noise                      
              amplifier, and the device performance evaluated.  The ability to               
              fabricate HTSC films on GaAs substrates opens up a very rich field             
              of opportunity for many superconducting film technologies.
