Abstract    :
              Traditional rock cutting, coring, and metal cutting methods have               
              serious technical, environmental, and safety limitations for                   
              underwater applications.  High-pressure abrasive-waterjet (AWJ)                
              cutting is currently being demonstrated as a revolutionary                     
              technique for cutting any material at ocean depths up to 20,000                
              feet.  This method is marginal in performance and operational                  
              reliability, however, and further improvements are not expected.               
              This research addresses a novel concept for cutting with high-                 
              velocity abrasive particle beams.  In this concept, the abrasives              
              are directly pumped through a nozzle, rather than entrained as in              
              an AWJ nozzle, to form a high-pressure abrasive slurry jet (ASJ).              
              QUEST demonstrated that cutting rates (under atmospheric                       
              conditions) can be increased fivefold compared to an AWJ using                 
              this new method.  In this research we will conduct a feasibility               
              study on using ASJs for underwater cutting.  A high-pressure                   
              (50,000 psi) abrasive slurry pump under development at QUEST will              
              be used in this investigation.  Parametric cutting tests will be               
              performed on rocks and metals.  Analytical studies will be used                
              to support the experimental work.  A conceptual design for an                  
              ocean floor cutting system will be prepared.
