Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project                 
              proposes to break the curricular gridlock which prevents little                
              teaching of probability and statistics in secondary school                     
              mathematics courses by developing new course materials and state-              
              of-the-art computer software based on current understanding of                 
              students' conceptions of probability and statistics.  The                      
              computer learning environment, provisionally named                             
              StochasticsLab, integrates simulation, data gathering, data                    
              display, exploratory data analysis, and statistical inferencing                
              capabilities.  Emphasis will be on illuminating the inner                      
              workings of statistical and probabilistic processes and promoting              
              investigation and exploration by allowing objects such as                      
              spinners, graphs, and statistical measurement tools to be linked               
              together by students and teachers to create dynamic micro-                     
              worlds.  Tightly focused yet widely applicable two-week modules                
              are proposed that could be integrated into other courses in the                
              high school curriculum or combined into a semester course.                     
              This project has educational merit and potential for widespread                
              impact on education.
