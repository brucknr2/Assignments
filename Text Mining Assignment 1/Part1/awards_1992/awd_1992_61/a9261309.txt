Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                                                                                             
                                                                                            
              The overall objective of this program is to develop a low cost,                
              high performance Coded Scanning Echo sounder (COSES) suitable for              
              bathymetric surveys in shallow water (<100-m).  A system will be               
              developed favorably compete in performance with the most                       
              sophisticated multibeam and interferometric sidescan sonars                    
              available today, but at a small fraction of their cost.  The                   
              performance goal is to achieve swath widths about 4 times the water            
              depth, angular resolution of 2 deg or less, and depth resolution of            
              about 10 cm at vessel speeds of up to 6-8 kts.                                 
                                                                                             
              COSES utilizes frequency coding and a single scanning narrow-beam              
              transmit transducer to achieve a broad swath while maintaining high            
              depth resolution.  The proposed phase I project will establish the             
              feasibility of COSES through the development of a numerical model              
              that simulates the characteristics of the system as well as the                
              operational conditions.  The project also included laboratory tests            
              with a scaled prototype and engineering system analysis.
