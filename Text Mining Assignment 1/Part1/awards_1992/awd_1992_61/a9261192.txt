Abstract    :
              This Phase I SBIR project deals with                                           
              structural/mechanical devices that improve the                                 
              performance or reduce the cost of earthquake                                   
              resistant structures.  These devices, such as                                  
              dampers, isolators, energy dissipators and active                              
              controls, use materials and technology that are                                
              quite new and untried.  Their long term endurance,                             
              maintenance requirements, and practical                                        
              applicability have as yet to be demonstrated.                                  
                                                                                             
              A special device that is completely within the state                           
              of the art of standard structural steel construction                           
              will be developed.  It consists of a specialized                               
              connector called the "sequential connector" that                               
              admits an initial, limited and repeated zero                                   
              resistance slip under loading.                                                 
                                                                                             
              A structural element, connected by means of the                                
              sequential connector to a lateral force resisting                              
              system, will augment the resistance of the system                              
              without a corresponding increase in its response                               
              frequency.  This unique property produces a                                    
              response to seismic excitation that is significantly                           
              lower than the displacement response if a standard                             
              connection is used.  The successful development                                
              and application of this innovation will significantly                          
              reduce the cost of earthquake mitigation and                                   
              improve the performance of steel buildings.
