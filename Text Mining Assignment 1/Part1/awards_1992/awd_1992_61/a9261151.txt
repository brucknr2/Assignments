Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              A new type of infrared multipixel staring array is proposed based              
              upon the recently observed phenomenon of photofluxonics.  The                  
              sensor is based on a simple Josephson junction and is the                      
              magnetic analogue of a CCD photosensor; a novel device geometry                
              allows the direct conversion of photons to fluxons.  The                       
              quantized nature of the photon to fluxon conversion process                    
              affords a very low NDP.  Experiments indicate that single quantum              
              sensitivity in the infrared and far infrared range of the                      
              spectrum is possible.  An array of such detectors would be an all              
              thin film, monolithic, focal plane device with inherently low                  
              power consumption.   It will be possible to implement the                      
              associated read out electronics on the same substrate.                         
                                                                                             
              Phase I will demonstrate the photofluxonic effect in a Nb-Al203-               
              Nb Josephson junction and, according to the results, optimize the              
              preliminary design for an array of superconducting photosensitive              
              pixels.  Although well characterized low Tc superconductors will               
              be used in Phase I, the photofluxonic effect has also been                     
              observed in high Tc superconductors and there seems to be no                   
              major impediment to implementing the technology with high Tc                   
              materials in Phase II.
