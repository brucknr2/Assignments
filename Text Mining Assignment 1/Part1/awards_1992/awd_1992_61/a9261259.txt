Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              A highly precise remote measurement system is proposed for the                 
              purpose of dynamically maintaining the figure of sub-millimeter-               
              wave radio telescope reflectors.  Such structures are normally                 
              distorted by the combined effects of wind forces and differential              
              thermal expansion.  The result of such distortions is that the                 
              telescopes are unable to achieve diffraction-limited angular                   
              resolution.  The implementation of a servo system in such                      
              telescopes would, at very small incremental cost, improve their                
              performance (angular resolution) by as much as an order of                     
              magnitude.  Such a servo system needs actuators to control the                 
              figure, and a metrology system to generate the error signals which             
              drive the actuators.  This proposal is aimed at creating the                   
              necessary metrology system.  It should be noted that modern                    
              submillimeter-wave antennae (or reflector dishes) are already                  
              equipped with mechanical actuators, which are used to bring the                
              reflector to its optimum shape following installation.  It should              
              be relatively straightforward matter to provide these actuators                
              with electronic controls to complete the servo loop.  The proposed             
              technology should be applicable not only to future telescopes and              
              telescopes under construction, but also as a retrofit to existing              
              submillimeter-wave telescopes.
