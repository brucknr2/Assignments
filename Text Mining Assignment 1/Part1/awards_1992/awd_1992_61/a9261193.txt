Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              A novel accelerator target for the production of high yields of                
              14 MeV neutrons will be developed.  In this target, a new method               
              will be used to inhibit the replacement of tritium with beam                   
              deuterons and thus prevent the evolution of tritium gas leading                
              to reduced neutron yield.  Usable lifetimes in the thousands of                
              hours range are expected.  In Phase II of the proposed research                
              program, a compact neutron generator utilizing this novel target               
              will be fabricated and tested.
