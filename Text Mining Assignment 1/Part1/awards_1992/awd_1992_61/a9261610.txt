Abstract    :
              Accurate control of the mold interior surface                                  
              temperature is critical for quality production of                              
              plastic parts.  Currently, most of the injection                               
              molding machines use open loop control without                                 
              any direct measurement of the mold surface                                     
              temperature.  The control variables are water                                  
              temperature and valve settings for the                                         
              cooling/heating water that is circulated through the                           
              mold.  Recently closed loop systems with                                       
              thermocouple measurements have become                                          
              available, but provide only limited usefulness.  This                          
              proposal discusses an innovative design for two                                
              dimensional temperature monitoring and regulation                              
              using an infrared sensor, image processing and                                 
              robust controller design using modern control                                  
              theory approaches.  Experimental data will be                                  
              collected during Phase I by Nalge Company, a                                   
              leading plastics manufacturer, to validate the                                 
              accuracy of temperature estimation using infrared                              
              camera, to identify models for controller design and                           
              to verify the performance of the closed loop                                   
              controller.  Phase II will consist of actual on-line                           
              demonstration of the system in an operational                                  
              environment.
