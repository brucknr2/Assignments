Abstract    :
              This project addresses methods to provide practitioners of                     
              mathematical programming with ready access to the advanced                     
              linear programming (LP) tools of Langrangean Relaxation (LR)                   
              and Lagrangean Decomposition (LD).  These tools are used                       
              primarily to solve mixed integer programs (MIP).  These                        
              programs arise naturally in the solution of problems that                      
              occur in myriad industrial settings, such as process                           
              industries, manufacturing, finance, government,                                
              transportation, and utilities.                                                 
                                                                                             
              Current application of state-of-the-art techniques to the                      
              solution of these problems is clearly held back by a lack of                   
              modeling tools.  This project will initiate work which                         
              combines one of the best modeling tools -- GAMS -- with the                    
              capabilities of LR and LD to provide an advanced modeling                      
              system that will facilitate the solution of large, complex                     
              problems,   This system will interactively provide the non-                    
              expert user with full access to the power of modern                            
              mathematical programming techniques for use in solving                         
              problems within their own fields of exploration.
