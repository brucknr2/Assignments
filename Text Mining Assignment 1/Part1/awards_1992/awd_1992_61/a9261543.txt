Abstract    :
              Large, complex software applications are pushing the                           
              performance limitations of today's engineering workstations.                   
              Such applications frequently require virtual memory greatly in                 
              excess of available physical memory, and performance becomes                   
              dominated by paging time.  Paging performance is ultimately                    
              dependent on the speed of disk I/O, which runs orders of                       
              magnitude slower than the maximum performance possible with                    
              physical memory and CPU speed alone.  Paging performance is                    
              directly related to the number of different pages the                          
              application touches (i.e., read or writes) per unit time.  The                 
              inverse of this measure can be thought of as a measure of                      
              "locality of reference."  When the number of pages touched per                 
              unit time significantly exceeds the amount of free physical                    
              memory, performance begins to degrade, sometimes dramatically.                 
                                                                                             
              This research aims to provide a mechanism for increasing                       
              locality of reference in an existing Common Lisp system by                     
              clustering objects in virtual memory with the goal of                          
              significantly decreasing the number of pages touched per unit                  
              time.  Specifically, the work is in two areas: (1) prototyping                 
              tools for reporting useful information on paging and locality                  
              of reference, and (2) to investigating methods for                             
              automatically increasing locality of reference during                          
              application execution.
