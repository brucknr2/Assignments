Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This proposal will investigate the feasibility of measuring to                 
              very high resolution (+200 microns) the locations of multiple                  
              components of known composition whose positions are intended to                
              conform to a well-defined pattern inside a structure.  The                     
              proposed technique relies on scanning photon beams across the                  
              structure surface, detecting transmitted and scattered radiation               
              in collimated detectors, and employing techniques such as                      
              template-matching that incorporate a priori information such as                
              size and composition of the components and their intended                      
              pattern.  A combined experimental and theoretical investigation                
              is undertaken to study design issues such as source energy,                    
              source and detector collimation, scan mode, scan step size and                 
              speed, and required number of detectors and their locations for a              
              practical instrument.
