Abstract    :
                   Plants are an inexpensive source of complex molecules.                    
              Several industries are based on chemical feedstocks of plant                   
              origin, ranging from flavors to pharmaceuticals.  The biosynthetic             
              pathways of plants may be more effectively manipulated through                 
              viral gene amplification than by conventional genetic engineering.             
              We propose to amplify specific target RNAs in transgenic plants                
              based on viral RNA replication.  The 5' and 3' viral replication               
              origins of tobacco mosaic virus will be combined with an internal              
              target sequence to be amplified.  Recombinant messenger RNA will be            
              synthesized from a gene inserted into the tobacco chromosome under             
              transcriptional control of a nominally constitutive promoter.  In              
              the presence of helper feasibility, we will quantify amplified gene            
              expression using the messenger RNA for the enzyme chloramphenicol              
              acetyltransferase (CAT) as a target sequence.                                  
              %%%                                                                            
              Because the levels of amplification and timing of expression will              
              be controlled by the helper virus, this technique will                         
              significantly extend the types of genetic manipulations possible in            
              transgenic crops.  Efficient production of high value biochemicals             
              in plants will create new opportunities for domestic growers and               
              strengthen the ability of the agricultural sector of our economy to            
              compete internationally.
