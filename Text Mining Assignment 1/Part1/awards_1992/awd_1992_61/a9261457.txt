Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              BioTraces Inc. (BT Inc.) has developed an ultrasensitive                       
              quantitation system which can be used with a large family of                   
              isotopes.  This system supports label multiplexing; many co-                   
              resident isotopes in the family can be quantitated                             
              simultaneously, allowing either the pooling of labeled samples of              
              the pooling of distinctly labeled probe reagents for multiple                  
              targets.  The proposed research will add two dimensional (2D)                  
              spatial resolution to the capabilities of the systems, in support              
              of nucleic acid quantitation and fractionation, including                      
              sequencing.  Because of the extensive multiplexing capabilities                
              and superior sensitivity, the proposed technique will greatly                  
              increase sample throughput in fractionation/quantitation tasks.
