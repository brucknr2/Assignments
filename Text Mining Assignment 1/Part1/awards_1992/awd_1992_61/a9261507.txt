Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Immunoassay has proven to be the most selective method for                     
              detection and identification of biological agents.  Optical                    
              fluoroimmunoassay (FIA), with single photon counting capability,               
              is supposed to be the most sensitive technique.  Unfortunately,                
              due to the high autofluorescent background from bulk samples, the              
              sensitivity of FIA is often reduced.                                           
                                                                                             
              In response to the need for this technology, Physical Optics                   
              Corporation (POC)C) proposes to develop a compact, highly sensitive            
              (0.01 picomole/ml) near-real time (less than 1 minute) biological              
              instrument based on optical evanescent wave detection.  The scope              
              and versatility of this proposed method can be enhanced by                     
              combining the principles of fluoroimmunoassay and POC's                        
              holographic planar waveguide technology.  Application of POC's                 
              proprietary transparent Moth Eye structure will increase the                   
              surface area of the waveguide, which is the sensing area of the                
              device.  The increase in surface area will enhance device                      
              sensitivity by two orders of magnitude over fiber optic sensors.               
                                                                                             
              The advantages of the proposed system include the conditions that              
              it involves no wash, no analyte separation, no autofluorescence,               
              and it can be simultaneously used to detect multiple analytes.                 
              The resulting device will be robust, easy to use, low cost, and                
              will have low maintenance and calibration requirements.
