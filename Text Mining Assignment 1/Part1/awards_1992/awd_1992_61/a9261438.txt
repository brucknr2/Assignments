Abstract    :
                   The goal of this project is to explore the application of                 
              nonlinear adaptive control and stabilization to viscous flow                   
              phenomena.  The objectives include drag and noise reduction, and               
              control of separation, transition, and turbulence.  Adaptive and               
              robust control methods will be applied to practical flow                       
              situations and will be validated via simulations.  The control                 
              will be accomplished via compliant wall techniques.                            
                                                                                             
                   The resulting software will be useful to aerospace industry               
              for the development of advanced aerospace vehicles.
