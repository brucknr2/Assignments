Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Light scattering (LS) is one of the most common techniques for                 
              polymer characterization.  The LS intensity and its angular                    
              dissymmetry are the two experimental results that give the polymer             
              molecular weight (MW) and molecular size (radius-of-gyration Rg)               
              information respectively.  When a multi-angle LS detector is                   
              coupled with a size exclusion chromatograph (SEC), the combined                
              instrument has the potential of determining the absolute MW and Rg             
              distribution of polymers.  In general, the existing LS instruments             
              have been expensive, bulky, and lack precision.                                
                                                                                             
              We plan to test a new concept for a high precision LS instrument               
              that is small, simple and inexpensive.  We will incorporate a                  
              multi-wavelength feature into our right angle laser LS (RALLS)                 
              technology.  The combination of a multi-wavelength RALLS detector              
              with SEC would be a very powerful polymer characterization                     
              technique.  This new approach can provide the needed accuracy and              
              precision in the MW and Rg determinations for solving industrial               
              problems that may relate to polymer size and shape changes, chain              
              branching, copolymer composition, or biopolymer conformational and             
              architectural differences.
