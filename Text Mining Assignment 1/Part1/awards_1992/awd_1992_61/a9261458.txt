Abstract    :
                   The objective of this research is to implement new                        
              algorithms using wavelet transforms to evaluate the fractal                    
              dimension of turbulent dynamical systems.  A major thrust of the               
              work will be the adaptation of arrays of transputers for fast and              
              efficient parallel computation.                                                
                                                                                             
                   The resulting hardware and software will be useful for image              
              analysis in medical applications.
