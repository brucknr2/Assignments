Abstract    :
                   This project focuses on urban emergency services,                         
              particularly police and emergency medical services (EMS).  Private             
              emergency repair services and, to some extent, urban fire                      
              protection services are also relevant to the research.  The goal               
              is to undertake a set of research steps to make the "Hypercube                 
              Queueing Model," truly useful for emergency services decision                  
              makers.  In particular, this research will incorporate into the                
              Hypercube model the most recent trends in police and EMS dispatch              
              operations, such as those emerging from community-oriented                     
              policing.  Four public agencies, in four states, have agreed to                
              serve as test sites and to provide data to the researchers for this            
              project.                                                                       
                   The Hypercube model will undergo a set of enhancements that               
              will make it compatible with community-oriented policing, the EMS              
              dispatch environment and other important emergency response                    
              systems.  The results could be of significant value to municipal               
              emergency services agencies in improving the productivity of their             
              response units.
