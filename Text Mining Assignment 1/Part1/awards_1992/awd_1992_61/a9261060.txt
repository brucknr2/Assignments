Abstract    :
              This proposal involves compression techniques for voice or image               
              data.  Over the past year Fastman has developed a new algorithm,               
              the Adaptive Wavelet Transform, which produces high-ratio data                 
              compression while maintaining the quality of the original data.                
              The goal of this SBIR project is to prove the feasibility of the               
              algorithm for real-time data compression of speech and image data.
