Abstract    :
              Highly selective transformations are of great importance to the                
              chemical industry because these avoid costly separations and                   
              reduce waste. To demonstrate the feasibility of molecular                      
              imprinting using inorganic systems, we propose to prepare a                    
              selective catalyst for the photocatalytic conversion of 2,6-                   
              diaminohexanic acid to optically pure L-pipecolic acid in high                 
              yield by imprinting polymeric TiO2 from sol-gel with the aid of                
              a template. A further objective of the proposed research is to                 
              prepare highly selective adsorbents for the separation of                      
              optical isomers using SiO2 from a sol-gel.
