Abstract    :
                   In recent years, confocal microscopy has been  developed                  
              to meet the increasing demands of 3-D imaging.  The deficiency                 
              of the technique is that the image data must be collected                      
              pixel by pixel through scanning, which makes the instrument                    
              slow, inefficient, complicated, and expensive.  3-D imaging                    
              will be realized through parallel pixel filtering techniques.                  
              A pixel filter array made of micro-optics can be constructed                   
              to perform spatial filtering for all image pixels                              
              simultaneously.  Only the light from the focal depth region                    
              can pass through the pixel filter array and the light from                     
              out-of-focus regions is rejected.  Sectioned images can be                     
              obtained without scanning.  The technique is expected to have                  
              better depth discrimination capability than that of the                        
              confocal technique.  Due to the elimination of image scanning,                 
              the technique will substantially increase the imaging speed,                   
              simplify the instrument design, and greatly reduce the costs.                  
              This program will lead to the development of a new 3-D imaging                 
              technique and may find wide applications not only to                           
              microscopic imaging but also to telescopic imaging.
