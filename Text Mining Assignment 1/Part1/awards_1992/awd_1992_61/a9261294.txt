Abstract    :
              The company proposes to design and develop a real-time video and               
              speech encoder/decoder system that combines a high quality, low                
              bit-rate, full color video coder with a high quality, very low                 
              bit-rate speech coder.  The target bit-rate for the combined video             
              and speech will range from 19.2 kbps to 64 kbps for frames of size             
              352x288 at 10 frames per second.  Commercial uses include video                
              conferencing, video telephony and e-mail, remote education, and                
              communications aids for the deaf.
