Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Current instruments for solar ultraviolet and stratospheric ozone              
              measurements are expensive to purchase and operate.  The proposer              
              aims to develop a low-cost solar ultraviolet scanning                          
              spectroradiometer, suitable for moderate resolution (1nm)                      
              measurements of solar irradiance in the UV-B spectral range, 290-              
              320nm.  The objectives of this instrument would be solar UV-B and              
              column ozone measurements for the detection of secular trends.                 
              Proposer plans to design and construct a Seya-Namioka                          
              nonochromator in order to determine the actual light throughput                
              of the proposed spectroradiometer.  Then the proposer will                     
              design, construct and evaluate the semiconductor detector                      
              circuit.  The proposed instrument would be available for global                
              monitoring of solar UV increases and stratospheric ozone                       
              depletion.
