Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Physical Sciences Inc. (PSI) proposes to develop a high flux, high             
              velocity (3 to 8 km/s) chlorine atom beam for etching of                       
              semiconductors.  Conventional dry etching systems are based on                 
              ion-assisted processes that can lead to device damage and                      
              degradation.  Neutral chlorine beam etching systems are under                  
              development but are limited to low energies (< 1 eV) or higher                 
              energies (> 100 eV). Low energy systems show significant under-                
              cutting and high energy beams cause substrate damage.  PSI will                
              develop an atomic chlorine beam to operate in an intermediate en-              
              ergy regime, 1 to 10 eV.  The proposed effort is based on  the fast            
              atom sample tester (FAST) technology developed at PSI.  Atomic                 
              oxygen (1 to 10 eV) produced using FAST technology exhibits a                  
              strong correlation between atom energy and surface reactivity with             
              graphite.  The data indicate an increase in first-collision                    
              reaction probability, with beam velocity, which is critical to                 
              achieving highly anisotropic etching.  At the highest Cl-atom beam             
              energies available from the FAST source, substrate damage is                   
              energetically unfavorable.
