Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This study will examine the permeability and selectivity for                   
              gas transport of isotropic polymeric membranes made of                         
              poly(trimethyl silylpropyne) (PTMSP; ?C(CH3)=C(SiCH3)3!n).                     
              Previous research on PTMSP membranes have shown that because                   
              of their large free volume, the solubility and diffusivity of                  
              gas molecules through the membrane is very large, and this                     
              results in a very high gas permeability.  The high                             
              permeability is accompanied by relatively low selectivity                      
              (i.e. the ration of the flux of one species to that of the                     
              other).  This lack of selectivity can be attributed again to                   
              the large free volume size which facilitates the easy passage                  
              of molecules of all sizes.  Consequently, to date PTMSP                        
              membranes have not been of practical value in gas separations.                 
              The research points out, however, that the selectivity has                     
              been measured by passing pure gases through the membrane and                   
              taking the flux ratio under identical driving conditions.                      
              Recent experiments have shown that the membrane exhibits                       
              selectivity in co-permeation:  In particular experiments at                    
              MTR demonstrate a 27:1 selectivity on n-butane in an n-                        
              butane/methane mixture at 24oC.  The result of this research                   
              will be built by studying pure and mixed gas transport in                      
              PTMSP with a series of permanent gases such as methane or air,                 
              and closely related organic solvent vapors (CCl4, CF4, a                       
              series of freons and with hydrocarbon vapors such as butane                    
              and pentane if successful, the research will lead to membranes                 
              which can separate butane from methane (important in the                       
              natural gas industry), and organic vapors from air (an                         
              important separation in many environmental concerns).
