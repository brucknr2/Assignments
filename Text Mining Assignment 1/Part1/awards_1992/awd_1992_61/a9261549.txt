Abstract    :
              An SBIR Award will support development of a covalent bonding                   
              agent for ceramic coatings deposited by the sol-gel technique.  A              
              bi-functional coupling agent will be used which be bond                        
              covalently to the metal or polymer substrate on the one hand and               
              simultaneously participate in the oxide gelation process.  This                
              is expected to create a covalent bond structure across the                     
              interface which should greatly improve coating adherence.  The                 
              study involves synthesis of the bonding agents, study of                       
              substrate reactions, and determination of interfacial adhesion nd              
              coating wear resistance.
