Abstract    :
                   The project concerns an augmented hydrostatic extrusion                   
              process for the production of fine wire, less than one mil in                  
              diameter, needed for the bonding of microchips.  Results from                  
              earlier work led to a detailed understanding of the factors                    
              limiting the productivity of this process and a prototype                      
              laboratory unit has verified the effectiveness of appropriate                  
              control procedures in overcoming these limitations.                            
                   An integrated system for clean room operation will be                     
              designed.  The prototype will demonstrate both the economic                    
              advantages of the augmented hydrostatic extrusion process and the              
              reliability and quality of the wire produced.
