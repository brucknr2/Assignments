Abstract    :
                   This research is to develop a compact flow sensor for high                
              accuracy semiconductor process control.  This sensor will be based             
              on a new variation of infrared (IR) absorption spectroscopy called             
              Spectral Correlation Detection.  In this approach, the reactant                
              concentration is quantified by IR absorption to control reactant               
              flow rates for deposition or etching applications.  This direct IR             
              measurement contrasts with current methods which indirectly meter              
              species flow rates.  While this system will be assembled and                   
              calibrated for model metal alkyl compounds, such as                            
              trimethylgallium, this IR sensor is versatile and can be applied               
              to a wide variety of deposition or etching species.                            
                   The development of an IR vapor phase flow controller based on             
              Spectral Correlation would have significant commercial application.            
              This sensor would improve the quality of silicon, III-V and II-VI              
              semiconductor devices, optical components, and thin films.
