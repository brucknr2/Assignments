Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project                 
              will develop an interactive materials science/engineering                      
              laboratory kit for use in basic materials courses which are a                  
              feature of all engineering programs, particularly in Civil and                 
              Mechanical engineering.  The kit will include test bars                        
              fabricated from advanced polymeric composites which are an                     
              important group of new materials of increasing interest.                       
              Specifically, the kit will allow students to compare theoretical               
              strength and actual strength of these different high technology                
              materials, and the ready-to-use test bars will help students                   
              better understand the strength characteristics of linear elastic               
              brittle materials such as ceramics.  The educational product of                
              this project has a broad and sustainable market particularly                   
              because the product is consumed in use and repeat sales will be a              
              necessity.
