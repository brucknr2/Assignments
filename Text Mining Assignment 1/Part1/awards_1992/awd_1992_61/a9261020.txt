Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              When a lens and it's focal length are extremely small, all                     
              aberrations scale with the size of the lens and at some point                  
              become ignorable.  For highest resolution it is desirable to have              
              a deep ultraviolet and high numerical aperture lens.                           
              Conventional lens making methods have proved inadequate for                    
              providing diffraction limited deep UV lenses which are                         
              reproducible enough to be used in metrology applications in the                
              semiconductor industry.                                                        
                                                                                             
              Microlenses as proposed here have the following advantages:                    
              Extremely reproducible; deep ultraviolet and large numerical                   
              apertures are possible; they have no polished curved surfaces                  
              they are potentially diffraction limited; and they are relatively              
              broad band although they are made from only one type of glass                  
              (fused silica, UV grade).                                                      
                                                                                             
              Applications include semiconductor metrology and inspection;                   
              biological and medical microscopy; and fiber optic coupling.
