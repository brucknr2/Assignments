Abstract    :
                   Diamond micromachining systems based on ultraviolet laser                 
              etching and optical sensing of surface morphology will be                      
              investigated for precision fabrication of complex structures in                
              diamond and diamond-like carbon.  The research addresses                       
              demonstration of ablation using a small waveguide excimer laser,               
              investigation of cutting speeds, demonstration of a optical surface            
              height probe, and investigation of techniques for graphite removal.            
                   Successful development of such a system would allow the                   
              generation of complex shapes in diamond, a material that is                    
              extremely difficult to shape because of its high hardness.
