Abstract    :
                   Next-generation intelligent systems and robots will require               
              the power of parallel computer, yet most novel parallel languages              
              are geared primarily for numerical calculation--e.g., signal                   
              processing--in which the data values are elementary numerical                  
              samples.  These models of computation fail miserably for                       
              calculations involving the highly-structured symbolic data required            
              for artificial intelligence application.  A "linear" language                  
              provides an elegant and intuitive "mechanical" model of parallel               
              computation in which structured values are transmitted as simply as            
              elementary values.  These "linear" data structures retain the                  
              ability to transmit highly structured information, yet avoid the               
              problems of aliasing and sharing.  The efficiency of existing                  
              linear language promising new implementation techniques.                       
              In Phase I, we will investigate the ability of our novel                       
              implementation approach to provide most of the efficiency of                   
              nonlinear shared data structures while preserving the elegant                  
              linear data model.  If successful, our Phase II implementation of              
              a parallel linear language will provide efficient execution,                   
              together with an elegant and intuitive programming model.  This                
              combination should increase the productivity of software                       
              development for intelligent applications utilizing MIMD parallel               
              computers.//
