Abstract    :
                   This research concerns the development of an advanced                     
              computational model for electromagnetic nondestructive                         
              evaluation.  The model allows the user to efficiently and                      
              reliably calculate the interaction between a probe and a flaw                  
              within a workpiece.                                                            
                                                                                             
                   The work will integrate recent research in the areas of                   
              volume-integral and boundary-integral equations in computational               
              electromagnetics.
