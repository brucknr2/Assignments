Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Microlithography Chemical Company plans to conduct a synthetic                 
              research program to explore a new synthetic and manufacturing                  
              approach for the development of advanced novolak resins for                    
              microelectronic, printed circuit board, and LCD applications.  More            
              precisely, an evaluation of scientifically designed novolak resins             
              with superior properties and reproducibility, specifically                     
              applicable for use in positive photoresists will be undertaken.                
              These resins would be designed based on recently published work on             
              the hydrogen bonding interactions between novolaks and                         
              photosensitive components of the resist.  They would also be                   
              designed to give higher dissolution rates, improved thermal                    
              stability, better batch-to-batch reproducibility, and very low                 
              metal ion contamination.                                                       
                                                                                             
              We plan to undertake an experimental program and develop a new                 
              synthetic approach, prepare discrete low MW oligomeric components,             
              and to convert these oligomers into a series of block copolymer                
              resins to be evaluated for relevant performance.  MCC will carry               
              out a program which could lead to the development of solid novolak             
              resins with less than 100 ppb metal ion and  10% batch-to-batch               
              reproducibility, and which are capable of providing resists with               
              better than 0.5 m resolution, approximately 100 mJ/cm2 threshold              
              energy, and at least 130C thermal stability.
