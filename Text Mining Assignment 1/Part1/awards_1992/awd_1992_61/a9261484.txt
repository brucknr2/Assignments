Abstract    :
              This proposal pertains to the development of a novel, cost                     
              effective, compact sensor for time resolved fluorescence                       
              spectroscopy of biological samples.  The sensor will have high                 
              time resolution (sub-nanosecond) for accurate fluorescence decay               
              time measurements with high sensitivity.  The sensor is based on               
              the pseudo random code modulated (PRM) cw lidar technique whereby              
              the fluorescence signal from the PRM laser excitation is detected              
              by a receiver system, and processed using cross correlators to                 
              determine the decay profile in real time.  The time resolution of              
              the measurement is enhance beyond the quantization precision of                
              the digitizer using a proprietary resolution enhancement                       
              technique.  The spectral information of the fluorescence signal                
              is obtained using a set of interference filters.  Unlike in the                
              pulsed laser fluorescence technique, the detectable signal is not              
              limited by the background noise level due to the inherent                      
              characteristic of the PRM phase sensitive technique.  In Phase I,              
              we will carry out a proof of concept experiment, critical system               
              analysis, and conceptual system design.  This sensor can be used               
              for the in vivo as well as remote measurement of the fluorescence              
              signal from samples in realtime.
