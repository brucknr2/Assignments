Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              An innovative method of fabricating large-area long wavelength                 
              infrared (LWIR) detector arrays that can be operated at room as                
              well as cryogenic temperatures is proposed.  This technique uses               
              established technologies of micro-machining and microelectronic                
              processing of silicon (Si) wafers for fabricating monolithic arrays            
              of LWIR detectors.  The detector elements of the array are formed              
              by an ultra-thin film of a bolometer material possessing the                   
              highest temperature coefficient of resistance known, and the                   
              readout electronic microcircuit is fabricated on the same silicon              
              chip next to the elements.  The resultant detector arrays will                 
              possess features of low cost, low weight, high responsivity and                
              high sensitivity.  The low cost is due to a monolithic array                   
              structure requiring no cooling.  The high responsivity is due a                
              large to a large temperature coefficient of resistivity (greater               
              than 15% to 0.2% for a conventional bolometer) of the new bolometer            
              material.  The high sensitivity is due to the combined effects of              
              high responsivity, low noise and high thermal isolation of the                 
              bolometer from its surroundings.
