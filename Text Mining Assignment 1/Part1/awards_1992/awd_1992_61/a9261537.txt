Abstract    :
                   Capillary-based optics (Kumakhov optics) control X-ray                    
              and low-energy neutron beams by means of multiple reflections                  
              at less than the critical angle.  Optics have demonstrated the                 
              capability to form convergent or quasi-parallel beams.  Such                   
              controlled beams have applications in many X-ray and neutron                   
              material analysis techniques.  Although the current generation                 
              of Kumakhov optics can provide substantial benefit, assembly                   
              constraints limit the achievable transmission efficiency,                      
              energy range, alignment, and minimum focal spot size of the                    
              resulting beam.  For many material analysis techniques these                   
              beam parameters affect the spatial resolution, detection                       
              limits, and measurement time.                                                  
                   A new generation of Kumakhov optics will be developed to                  
              improve X-ray and neutron beam control.  These optics will be                  
              manufactured as a single piece.  The channels which deflect                    
              the photons or neutrons will have variable diameters over the                  
              length of the optic.  The Phase I effort will include Monte                    
              Carlo simulations of X-ray transmission efficiency and exit                    
              divergence with such structures, and experimental measurements                 
              of the X-ray transmission properties of a few early one-piece                  
              prototypes.                                                                    
                   Phase II would include development and testing of fully                   
              functional one-piece optics.  Such optics could potentially                    
              produce X-ray or neutron focal spot sizes <10 m and channel                   
              x-rays with energies > 100 keV.
