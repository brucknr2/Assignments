Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project                 
              investigates the use of a computer mouse as a position encoder                 
              for science experiments.  This use of the mouse would allow for                
              the representation of circular motion and other interesting                    
              problems.  The mouse interface is now built into all computers.                
              Thus, this use of the mouse would not only make available a                    
              powerful measuring device, it would also be a piece of equipment               
              that is low-cost, easy to use, and not restricted to a specific                
              computer model.  The potential for its impact in science                       
              classrooms is only limited by the imaginations of the teachers.
