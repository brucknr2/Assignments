Abstract    :
                   This research project will investigate wavelength                         
              stabilization of a laser diode for use in a distance measuring                 
              interferometer or related device.  The long range benefits of this             
              program will be a low cost linear distance measuring interferometer            
              for use in precision machine tools, semiconductor manufacturing                
              equipment, precision metrology and laboratory measurements.  A                 
              stabilization technique based upon temperature control of the laser            
              diode will be researched.  The temperature is controlled either by             
              an attached thermoelectric (TE) cooler, varying the injection                  
              current to the laser diode or both.  This approach requires an                 
              external interferometer to develop a control signal based upon                 
              wavelength drift if more than crude wavelength stability is to be              
              obtained.  In a distance measuring interferometer, this control                
              signal can be obtained with little additional effort.                          
                   Successful completion of this research program will result in             
              a wavelength stabilized source for use in a compact and low cost               
              linear distance measuring interferometer which can compete in the              
              same markets as glass scales as well as many markets currently                 
              served by helium-neon based linear distance measuring                          
              interferometer.
