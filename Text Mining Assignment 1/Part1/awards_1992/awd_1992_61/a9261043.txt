Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The proposed program is to adapt the Heat Exchanger Method (HEM)               
              for the growth of ZnTe crystals.  The integrity of the silica                  
              ampoule can be maintained during HEM growth because there are no               
              temperature gradients built into the heat zone and a support                   
              structure for the ampoule can be used with minimal interference for            
              heat flow.  It is intended to grow crystals under low superheat                
              conditions and to control the temperature gradient in the solid by             
              the heat exchanger.  ZnTe has potential for applications involving             
              green LEDs in optical displays, high density recording and optical             
              communications.
