Abstract    :
                   HeadMouse is an inexpensive microprocessor-controlled                     
              infrared-light-based system that indicates head position in real-              
              time, so as to enable a computer user to control cursor movement on            
              a computer display by head movement without any head constraints or            
              head mounted apparatus (glasses, helmet, etc.).  By activating the             
              system using a designated key on a standard keyboard or by sing a              
              foot-operated or other kind of switch or special head motion, the              
              user can position the cursor in the same manner as the conventional            
              mouse by changing head direction thereby allowing use of presently             
              available software.  Such a head direction director user-computer              
              interface should not only be competitive for the general personal              
              computer "mouse" market, but also should have significant                      
              advantages in laptop, disabled, oriental character, entertainment              
              and military niche markets.  It could also easily be adapted to                
              operate as a three-dimensional headmouse.
