Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project                 
              will develop a multi-media software product for the teaching of                
              modern statistics, one of the most widely studied subjects in the              
              undergraduate business and social science curricula.  The product              
              will employ full-motion video, animation, and simulation                       
              integrating these with data analysis into a work-station based                 
              environment.  The software will permit personalized instruction                
              and will rely heavily on visualization methodology to make                     
              statistical concepts and methods easier to learn and understand.               
              Effective training of students in methods of statistics and data               
              analysis is crucial to the continual improvement of quality and                
              productivity upon which the competitiveness of U.S. industry                   
              depends.
