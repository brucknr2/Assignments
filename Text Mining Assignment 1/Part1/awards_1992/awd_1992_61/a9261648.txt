Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              In this project, Dimension Technologies Inc.  (DTI) proposes to                
              investigate issues related to a color version of the high                      
              resolution illumination scheme being investigated under the current            
              NSF program number ISI-9161185,  titled "Demonstration of a Method             
              of Creating a Very High Resolution Autosteroscopic Flat Panel                  
              Display."                                                                      
                                                                                             
              The work will involve research into a field-sequential color                   
              illumination technique for liquid crystal displays that promises               
              to allow the creation of ultrahigh resolution two-dimensional or               
              autostereoscopic three-dimensional images  DTI has augmented its               
              staff with experts in the fields of color and psychophysics for                
              purposes of this research.  We believe the technique proposed has              
              features that overcome some of the problems and limitations                    
              associated with previous field-sequential color illumination                   
              schemes, while simultaneously allowing the creation of images that             
              have greater resolution than that provided by the LCD pixels                   
              themselves.                                                                    
                                                                                             
              If Phase 1 is research is successful,  it would lead to the                    
              development of a prototype display that would use low cost LCD's               
              yet be capable of very high resolution.  We are convinced this                 
              would broad appeal in the display industry which perpetually seeks             
              higher resolution and improved manufacturing yields at lower costs.
