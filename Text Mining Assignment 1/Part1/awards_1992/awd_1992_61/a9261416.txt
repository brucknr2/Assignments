Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The project will provide the research foundation for the creation              
              of a graphical-reasoning-congruent interface and task-table-based              
              experiment-generator software system that enhances the reasoning               
              processes of behavioral researchers in the creation, running, and              
              analyses of behavioral research.  The major projects will determine            
              the operators and functions utilized in computerized experiments               
              published in the major cognitive and psychological journals in                 
              1992;  implement a research prototype Graphical Experiment                     
              Specification Interface (GESI);  evaluate the reasoning of                     
              behavioral science researchers working with and without the GESI               
              system;  and create and assess the precision of hardware and                   
              software methods to evaluate critical screen timing and display                
              luminance.  Later phases of this project could improve behavioral              
              research methodology in as many as a thousand university and                   
              commercial laboratories within three years and allow the US to take            
              a world leadership position in distributing behavioral research                
              software for experiment generation.  The research will identify                
              reasoning support tools to advance scientific problem solving that             
              may be transferred to other disciplines and commercial graphical               
              user interfaces.  It will enhance graphical user interface                     
              technology to provide problem solving and reasoning aids.
