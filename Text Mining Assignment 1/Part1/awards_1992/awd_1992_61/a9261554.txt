Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              An extremely sensitive, low power, high durability solid state                 
              sensor system for field analysis of groundwater pollution is                   
              proposed.  When successfully developed, it will result in an                   
              important new capability for locating and monitoring trace                     
              organic species in the groundwater environment.                                
                                                                                             
              The objective of the proposed program is to build on ongoing                   
              sensor and surface chemistry research at TPL so that the proposed              
              sensor system can yield practical results in several areas,                    
              including:  an improved understanding of the levels of organic                 
              chemicals at a pollution site, an automated mechanism for                      
              monitoring the migration of pollutants, a rapid and accurate                   
              assessment technique to assess the effects of purification                     
              technologies employed to mitigate hazardous waste problems.                    
                                                                                             
              The proposed research should result in a new sensor system with                
              significant capabilities necessary for enhanced understanding of               
              the causes and effects of groundwater pollution and the efficacy               
              of treatments to repair the damage.
