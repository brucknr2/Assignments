Abstract    :
              This research is aimed at the                                                  
              development of a versatile                                                     
              environmental controller that will                                             
              allow persons with varying                                                     
              disabilities to control multiple                                               
              external devices in their                                                      
              environment (e.g., home appliances,                                            
              computers, etc.).  This controller                                             
              is different from existing devices                                             
              in that clinical professionals will                                            
              be more able to adapt it to meet                                               
              the needs of end users with various                                            
              disabilities.  Existing devices are                                            
              often limiting and impose                                                      
              constraints on the types of                                                    
              input/output information they can                                              
              process.  As such, clinician often                                             
              have difficulty adapting the                                                   
              controllers to the end users and,                                              
              consequently, the users are                                                    
              provided with less-than-optimal

              generally expensive to set up and                                              
              many have questionable utility and                                             
              reliability.
