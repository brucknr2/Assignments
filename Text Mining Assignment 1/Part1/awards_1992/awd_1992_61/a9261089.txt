Abstract    :
                   A computational design tool will be developed which will                  
              allow for optimal tolerance allocation for mechanical and                      
              electrical components.  The basic approach is to couple a                      
              nontraditional optimization method with a Monte Carlo based                    
              tolerance analysis code.  The ability to allocate tolerances in an             
              optimal fashion will allow an installed capital base to be utilized            
              in the most productive fashion.  A successful application of the               
              technique will have a dramatic impact on reducing manufacturing                
              cost and product cycle times as well as increasing productivity,               
              quality and customer satisfaction.                                             
                   Current tolerance analysis used in industry does not provide              
              the ability to allocate tolerances in an optimal fashion.                      
              Traditional nonlinear programming methods are not robust enough to             
              solve the complex problem resulting from the consideration of a                
              "real" component or assembly.  The combination of the genetic                  
              algorithm with a tolerance analysis package offers an attractive               
              alternative which will run efficiently on a parallel or distributed            
              computing network.  Initial consideration will be placed on                    
              discrete tolerance limit optimization. The applicability to                    
              modifying nominal dimensions and assembly sequence will also be                
              investigated.
