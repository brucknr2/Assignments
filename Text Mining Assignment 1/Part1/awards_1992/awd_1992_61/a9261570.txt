Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is              
              in the area of theoretical and computational chemistry.  This                  
              research will explore the issues involved in parallelizing                     
              Gaussian 92, the most widely used electronic structure software                
              package, using the Linda programming environment for workstation               
              networks and multiprocessors.  Since both Gaussian 92 and Linda                
              emphasize portability across multiple computer architectures, this             
              project will offer chemists electronic structure modeling with the             
              power of parallel processing while retaining both the range of                 
              models offered by Gaussian and the choice of most cost-effective               
              platform for each user.  At some sites otherwise idle cycles on                
              existing workstation local area networks (LANs) are expected to                
              provide a major source of new and productive computing capacity                
              which can be utilized as a result of this effort.  In order to                 
              achieve this, the key kernels of the algorithms in Gaussian for                
              various models must be identified, and methods developed of                    
              parallelizing these computations while retaining their high                    
              efficiency on individual processors. The Phase I research will                 
              demonstrate the feasibility of using Linda on workstation networks             
              for this purpose on one critical type of model, Hartree-Fock                   
              (including gradients and second derivatives), identify the key                 
              kernels of the other models, and develop a strategy for                        
              parallelizing them as part of a Phase II effort.

              This Phase I project addresses the important questions of how                  
              Gaussian 92, the premier ab initio code which is used by                       
              industrial and academic researchers alike, can be run in a                     
              distributed network.  The research plan should establish proof of              
              concept for a product that is expected to be commercially                      
              important.
