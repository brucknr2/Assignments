Abstract    :
              Single and multicomponent oxides of high purity and nanometer                  
              particle sizes will be prepared using vapor phase reaction                     
              process.  In Phase I, the reaction and particle formation                      
              mechanisms will be simulated to relate particle size and surface               
              composition to mixing geometries, gas phase compositions and                   
              temperatures.  Limited experimental work will be performed to                  
              prepared several grams of a metal oxides material for particle                 
              size analysis and surface chemistry investigations.                            
                                                                                             
              High purity single and multicomponent oxides in the nanometer                  
              size range have potential applications in catalysis and other                  
              advanced materials such as ceramics.
