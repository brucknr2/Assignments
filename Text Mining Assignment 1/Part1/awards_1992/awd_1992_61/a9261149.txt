Abstract    :
                   The goal of this project is to develop a computational                    
              simulation tool to allow scaling up the designs of laboratory                  
              sized of semi-industrial granular flow systems to full scale                   
              industrial dimensions.  The Phase I project will concentrate on                
              dilute granular systems, setting the framework for the inclusion               
              of increasingly dense in the future Phases.  The analysis will be              
              based on the kinetic theory and numerical computations.                        
                                                                                             
                   Practical applications range from the design of chutes to                 
              hoppers to bins and other systems for transporting bulk solids.
