Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  Snake venom is a store-house of numerous bioreactive proteins.            
              These proteins are enzymes, toxins and may be growth factors.                  
              Venoms from several species of snakes in concentrations from 100 to            
              6.25 ug/ml were tested on primary culture of mouse kidney and                  
              spleen cells and established PC-12 cell cultures. Venoms from all              
              tested species of snakes were found to be cytolytic, except for                
              Crotalus atrox and Oxyuranus scutellatus, which showed growth                  
              proliferative effects on these cell cultures.                                  
                   The venom of C. atrox was studied further. The growth of                  
              primary cultures in medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS)             
              was equivalent to the growth obtained in serum free medium,                    
              containing 50 to 25 ug/ml crude venom. The growth of PC-12 cells               
              was accelerated tremendously in serum free medium supplemented with            
              venom. Thus, it is apparent that snake venom contains a cell growth            
              factor.                                                                        
                   Snake venom derived growth factor (SVGF) will be isolated in              
              purity from the venom of C. atrox by HPLC or isoelectric                       
              electrophoresis. Each fraction will be tested for growth on PC-12              
              cells. The fraction showing a cell growth effect will be tested on             
              variety of cell lines and with different media.                                
                   Proposed research will lead to a novel cell growth factor,                
              which will replace the use of fetal bovine serum (FBS) in cell                 
              cultures. Use of  SVGF may be extended to grow epithelial cells                
              from burn victim for creating autograph.
