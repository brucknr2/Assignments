Abstract    :
                   Today, everything from computers, consumer electronics, to                
              military equipment is driven by micro-chips, the first link in the             
              chain of technology for the microelectronic industry.  In order to             
              extend the flexibility and capacity of device and system design,               
              microelectronic packaging is becoming as important as silicon                  
              fabrication.  Among existing encapsulation methods, plastic                    
              packaging, which accounts for eighty percent of the market share,              
              will continue to play a major role in the growth of the                        
              microelectronic industry.  The performance reliability of plastic              
              packaging, greatly depends on the performance of the encapsulants              
              and manufacturing methods.  Traditionally, design and manufacturing            
              for microelectronic encapsulation with plastic packaging are                   
              conducted in an ad hoc manner based on experience and intuition,               
              which is costly and time consuming.                                            
                   The study is aimed at establishing the scientific basis and               
              attaining an engineering solution for characterizing the process.              
              It will employ experimental, analytical and computational efforts              
              to develop an efficient, reliable analysis tool.  The results of               
              the research will improve understanding of the process and                     
              facilitate simultaneous engineering by means of computer                       
              simulation.
