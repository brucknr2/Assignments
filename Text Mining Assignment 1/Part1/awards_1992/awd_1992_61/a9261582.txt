Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                                                                                             
                                                                                            
              The manner in which atmospheric energy is transferred to ocean                 
              surface current is not fully understood.  Measurements of surface              
              currents cannot be obtained from in situ sensors because of surface            
              wave motions.  Consequently, a recently-developed radar remote                 
              sensing technique that can be used to measure ocean surface                    
              currents is proposed, which can be used for future scientific                  
              investigations.                                                                
                                                                                             
              In this Phase I efforts, Quadrant Engineering will establish the               
              feasibility of a multifrequency microwave radar system to make                 
              surface current measurements and prepare a detailed design of a                
              prototype system that can be built and used in a field experiment              
              that can be carried out during Phase II.
