Abstract    :
                   This project is a feasibility study on applications of some               
              new mathematical models for laminated plates and shells.  The                  
              company aims to create software that implement these models in                 
              commercially viable packages.  At present the analysis and design              
              of laminated composites is based on highly simplified and                      
              therefore inaccurate models.                                                   
                                                                                             
                   The software produced under this project will be of interest              
              to practicing engineers as well as to materials scientists.
