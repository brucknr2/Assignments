Abstract    :
                      This project concerns the development and evaluation of a              
              portable on-line x-ray diffraction system for in-situ monitoring               
              of critical material properties in thin film vapor deposition                  
              systems. An available x-ray type transducer, the position sensitive            
              scintillation detector, will be modified for use in sputter reactor            
              environments. Issues to be addressed include the thermal and                   
              physical isolation of the device from the reactor environment,                 
              while retaining its positioning flexibility. The feasibility of                
              using the modified system for in-situ x-ray diffraction monitoring             
              of sputtered film growth will also be evaluated.                               
                      Successful in-situ monitoring of critical microstructural              
              material properties would greatly enhance process control in a wide            
              variety of manufacturing processes involving solid state                       
              crystalline materials processing. Such a device would also be                  
              useful in on-line non-destructive inspection and quality control.
