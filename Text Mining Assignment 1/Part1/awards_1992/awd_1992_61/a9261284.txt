Abstract    :
                   This research will focus on the design, implementation and                
              test of the feasibility of a software module to translate spiral               
              CT scan data sets of discrete objects into solid mathematical                  
              models.  This will prove the concept and demonstrate the                       
              feasibility of direct input from discrete objects (and object                  
              assemblies) into a state-of-the-art CAD/CAM/CAE system.  It will               
              automate the process and prove the equivalence of mathematical                 
              models, replica objects (created with stereolithography from the               
              mathematical representations), and original objects.                           
                   The feasibility of Spiral CT for imaging object assemblies                
              will be demonstrated using phantom test fixtures.  The images will             
              be automatically analyzed using a specially designed software                  
              system.  The researchers will develop and test methods for                     
              converting voxel data sets to solid models and finally into                    
              stereolithography format.  The solid models will be compared with              
              the original objects and the errors quantified.  It is predicted               
              that the flexibility and data quality of object modeling by Spiral             
              CT will prove adequate for custom manufacturing applications.
