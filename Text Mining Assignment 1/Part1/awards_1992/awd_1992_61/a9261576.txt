Abstract    :
              Currently used method of stress laminating sawn timber bridge decks            
              possesses a significant stress relaxation problem due to the rod               
              force being applied perpendicular to grain.  Based on theoretical              
              consideration, a cross laminate can be developed which would                   
              greatly improve the stress relaxation characteristic of the decking            
              and, at the same time, provide a better dimensionally stable                   
              product with potential for material amount and quality savings.                
              An experimental investigation is proposed to compare the stress                
              relaxation characteristics of the cross laminate to that of solid              
              sawn lumber.  The experimental investigation will also encompass               
              the effect of variation of core to face and back material ratio.
