Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Cubic boron nitride (c-BN) films are attractive for coating wear               
              parts because of their hardness and oxidation resistance Its wide              
              band gap and high thermal conductivity make it a useful material               
              for electronic applications.  This work will demonstrate the                   
              feasibility of using a novel Nonequilibrium Plasma Jet (NEPJ),                 
              which is capable of depositing materials at high rates, for                    
              producing c-BN films; if successful this process should be scalable            
              to commercial applications.
