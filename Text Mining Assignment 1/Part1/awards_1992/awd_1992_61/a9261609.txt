Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The use of fiber-optic sensors in conjunction with florescence                 
              spectroscopy has found many uses in biochemistry, immunoassays,                
              closed-aquaculture systems and other applications.  However, the               
              use of in situ fluorescence measurement during filed tests has                 
              been hampered by the physical limitations of spectrometers                     
              related to their size, weight and stability.  To fulfill the need              
              of a compact and portable spectrometer compatible with fiber-                  
              optic sensors in detection/analysis of fluorescence spectrum,                  
              American Research Corporation of Virginia proposes a novel fiber-              
              optic Fourier-transform spectrometer (FOFTS) having no moving                  
              parts.  Optical-path difference is achieved by the use of                      
              electrically addressed phase modulators in one of the Mach-                    
              Zehnder interferometric beam paths.  This design provides rapid                
              scanning, light weight and cost-effectiveness without                          
              compromising the performance of the spectrometer.  The technical               
              objectives of the Phase I program include selection of optical                 
              components for a fiber-optic interferometer, evaluation of                     
              methods to achieve optical-phase modulation, calibration of                    
              optical-phase modulators using laser and broadband light sources               
              and acquisition of families of fluorescence data.
