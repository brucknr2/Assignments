Abstract    :
                   Present manufacturing technologies for non-volatile                       
              ferroelectric random access memories (FRAM) are not sufficiently               
              developed to ensure reproducible deposition of large area, high                
              oriented polycrystalline PZT (Lead-Zirconate-Titanate) thin films              
              on substrates compatible with semiconductor integrated technology.             
              In order to address problems of large area stoichiometry and                   
              compatibility with thermally sensitive semiconductor substrates                
              used in very large scale integrated circuit (VLSIC) fabrication,               
              the researcher suggests laser crystallization of spin-on                       
              ferroelectric thin films for radiation-hard memories.  The project             
              is innovative in the precise control of temperature distribution               
              afforded by laser crystallization.  The program objectives include             
              the evaluation of spin-on deposition and pre-anneal conditions,                
              identification of laser crystallization parameters,                            
              characterization of PZT ferroelectric thin films and integration               
              of films into parallel plate capacitor configurations.  The                    
              significance of laser crystallization of spin-on ferroelectric thin            
              films lies in minimizing the thermal budget, interdiffusion of                 
              substrates/electrodes/film, phase segregation and in increasing                
              compatibility with thermally sensitive semiconductor substrates.               
              Further advantage lies in the use of standard aluminum                         
              metallization technology in VLSIC manufacturing currently limited              
              to FRAM applications due to high temperature diffusion problems.               
                   Successful completion of this research will result in the                 
              fabrication of cost-effective non-volatile random access memories              
              having improved quality, reliability and performance.
