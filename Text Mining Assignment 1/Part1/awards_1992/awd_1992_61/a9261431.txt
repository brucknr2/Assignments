Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project is in the               
              general area of Analytical and Surface Chemistry and in the                    
              subfield of surface spectroscopy.  This research should determine              
              the feasibility of developing an inelastic tunneling spectrometer              
              capable of measuring the vibrational spectrum of adsorbed species              
              on surfaces in the room temperature regime.  The device features               
              inelastic tunneling and field emission of electrons across a gas               
              or vacuum gap.  The novel innovation in this device is the use of              
              reversed biased semiconductor electrodes.  Electrons generated in              
              an inversion layer on p-Si have a very narrow distribution of                  
              energies which leads to an electron beam probe with a bandwidth as             
              low as 2.8 meV at room temperature, depending on doping density.               
              The narrow bandwidth allows inelastic spectra to be determined at              
              room temperature.  Previously liquid helium temperatures (4.2 deg              
              K) were required to obtain good resolution.  The new device should             
              have all the beneficial properties of low temperature inelastic                
              tunneling spectroscopy including very wide spectral range and                  
              fractional monolayer sensitivity.  Additional attributes of the                
              new device will be operation at room temperature and use of                    
              substrates other than alumina.                                                 
              %%%                                                                            
              The spectral tool whose feasibility is being evaluated in this                 
              Phase I research should enable the vibrational spectroscopic                   
              characterization of many adsorbed molecules which play critical                
              roles in numerous technologically and commercially important                   
              processes.
