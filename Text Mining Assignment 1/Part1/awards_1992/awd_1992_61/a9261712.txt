Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  Cirrus clouds continuously cover nearly 40% of the earth's                
              surface and are now known to have a significant influence on the               
              global radiation budget.  For example, tropical storms generate                
              cirrus anvils that are blown hundreds of kilometers downwind and               
              limit warming of the sea surface.  This in turn may influence the              
              subsequent generation of tropical storms and may even play a role              
              in controlling the Sourthern Oscillation (i.e., the El Nino event).            
                                                                                             
                   Limited aircraft observations using crystal collectors and                
              replicators suggest that cirrus are composed mostly of ice crystals            
              with complex shapes that range in size from about 10 um to 1 mm.               
              However, the collectors and replicators used in these studies are              
              limited to making coarse spatial observations and do not provide               
              good measurements of crystal concentration.  The current aircraft              
              optical imaging probes are not capable of making good measurements             
              of crystal concentrations for sizes < about 150 um.  This is an                
              inherent limitation of conventional optical systems because the                
              depth of field (DOF), and consequently the sample volume, decreases            
              with the square of the crystal radius.                                         
                                                                                             
                   Here, the PI proposes a new optical instrument using a novel              
              digital holographic imaging system (DHIS) which increases DOF                  
              compared to conventional imaging systems by more than a factor of              
              100.  In Phase I, the PI performs numerical simulations and                    
              laboratory tests of a DHIS which will provide three-dimensional                
              information on ice crystals in cirrus.  The airborne instrument, to            
              be built and tested in Phase II, could provide digitized 3-D                   
              holograms at rates up to 100 Hz of ice crystals with diameters from            
              5 um to 2.5 mm.
