Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              It has been well-established that poor thermal management is a                 
              limiting factor in the reliability and lifetime of electronic                  
              components in advanced electronic systems, leading to the search               
              for improved materials for electronic components such as substrates            
              or heat sinks.  In this research, a novel reinforcing fiber,                   
              diamond fiber, for enhancing thermal management in electronic                  
              components is proposed.  The fibers will be produced by depositing             
              polycrystalline diamonds on highly graphitic, sub-micron graphite              
              fiber through a plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD)              
              technique.  Successful development of diamond fibers will provide              
              an excellent addition to available materials for heat removal for              
              high density, high power electronic components, providing ultra                
              high thermal conductivity, tailorable CTE, and good mechanical                 
              properties.                                                                    
                                                                                             
              The proposed research identifies an outstanding reinforcement to               
              improve thermal performance of current materials.  Success of the              
              research could lead to new composites with much higher thermal                 
              conductivity and tailorable CTE for future electronic devices.                 
              These composites can be used as substrates and heat sinks.
