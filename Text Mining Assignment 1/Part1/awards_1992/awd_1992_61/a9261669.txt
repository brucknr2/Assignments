Abstract    :
                   This project concerns the development of a diode-pumped                   
              solid state laser for material processing.  The laser is expected              
              to demonstrate 45% conversion efficiency from diode pump light to              
              fiber coupled light at 2 and 1 micron wavelengths.  The increased              
              efficiency results from the novel pumping geometry which traps the             
              light into an optical cavity containing the laser rod.  Also,                  
              diodes produce only light which is directly usable by the solid-               
              state material, reducing the thermal difficulties associated with              
              arc lamp sources which produce light throughout the spectrum.                  
                   The research seeks to develop a small-scale laser to                      
              deliver at least 8 watts of power through the optical fiber at 2               
              micron and 1 micron wavelengths.  The geometry can potentially                 
              deliver 500 watts from a single industrial-sized laser. Multiple               
              rods of this size can be coupled to achieve multi-kilowatt power               
              delivery through a single optical fiber.  Thus, the research is                
              focused on results that could lead to  next generation equipment               
              that could substantially raise production rates and reduce costs               
              in manufacturing processes such as welding and cutting.
