Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Millions of tons of mine tailings and dump wastes occur                        
              throughout the United States that contain residual metals of both              
              commercial and environmental interest.  Many of these materials                
              contain economic concentrations of copper, silver, and other                   
              metals.  Other heavy metals such as lead, zinc, and cadmium are                
              found in these materials that may leach into surface and ground                
              water supplies.  Many of these tailings and dumps have been on                 
              site for many years and have been weathered or oxidized.                       
              Therefore, classical biooxidative leaching is not appropriate for              
              these materials.  MBX Systems Inc. has shown that bioreductive                 
              bacteria can solubilize metals from oxide minerals.  MBX Systems               
              Inc. proposes to use these nonacid-generating bacteria to                      
              biologically reprocess these waste materials recovering                        
              marketable metals to support the operations and removing other                 
              metals that are toxic to the environment.
