Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project                 
              has the objective of producing the design specifications for                   
              computer products that illustrate central  concepts in                         
              electricity and magnetism, chemistry, optics, mechanics, and                   
              digital and analog circuitry to use to teach physical sciences to              
              elementary school students.  These products would be in the form               
              of a series of animated educational games that would utilize a                 
              variety of formats such as adventures, problem-solving, and                    
              games.  The proposed courseware could fill a critical need in                  
              schools and has potential for success in the home                              
              education/entertainment market as well.
