Abstract    :
                   The objective of this research is to develop a versatile                  
              simulator more multi-phase fluid flow in porous media.  A                      
              general, non-isothermal compositional formulation allowing                     
              chemical transport in all phases will be used.  The model will                 
              incorporate state-of-the-art numerical schemes to provide                      
              solutions in a wide variety of practical problems.                             
                                                                                             
                   The resulting simulator may be used to model chemical                     
              spills, leaky fuel tanks, and improper waste disposal practices.
