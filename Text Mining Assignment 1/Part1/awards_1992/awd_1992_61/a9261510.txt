Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The goal of the proposed research is to demonstrate epitaxial                  
              growth, by laser ablation in a UHV vacuum system of high quality,              
              insulating oxide films onto heated single crystal silicon                      
              substrates, followed by CVD epitaxial growth of silicon onto the               
              insulating oxide. Based on recent reports of successful epitaxial              
              growth of MgO on silicon and gallium arsenide, CeO2 on silicon, and            
              PrO2 on silicon, we propose to focus on MgO, CeO2, and PrO2 as the             
              candidate epitaxial insulating layers.  Although a successful                  
              process would open up many applications, the goal for this work is             
              to enable a silicon-on-insulator structure in which the insulator              
              is grown epitaxially. Alternatively, the epitaxial oxide film may              
              provide a highly selective etch stop for a bond-and-etch-back                  
              silicon-on-insulator process.
