Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Funded through an SBIR Phase I grant, a concept for the                        
              removal of particles from liquid effluent and process streams                  
              is to be explored. The concept is claimed to hold the                          
              potential for greater efficiency and economy of particle                       
              removal. Both experiments and process modeling are to be                       
              utilized. The concept involves a combination of flow swirl and                 
              porous tube filtration.                                                        
                                                                                             
              Particle separation from flow streams is of great importance                   
              in a large variety of manufacturing and processing systems.
