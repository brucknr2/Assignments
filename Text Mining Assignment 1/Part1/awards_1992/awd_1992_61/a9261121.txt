Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This program is aimed at development of a novel method of                      
              controlling N2O emissions from fluidized bed coal combustors,                  
              involving injection of sodium vapor at very low levels into                    
              the flue gas leaving the fluidized bed.  The objectives of the                 
              Phase I effort are: (1) Demonstrate that sodium injection can                  
              cause substantially complete decomposition of N2O at                           
              conditions relevant to coal-fired fluid bed combustors; (2)                    
              Obtain chemical kinetic data for comparison with predictions                   
              of kinetic calculations; and, (3) Complete that comparison.                    
              Laboratory experiments will be carried out in a system                         
              consisting of four subsystems, a system for blending fixed                     
              gases and vaporized liquids, a sodium vaporizer, a reactor,                    
              and an analytical train.  The reactor to be employed consists                  
              of a quartz tube into which a length of steel tubing projects,                 
              with the main flow gas going through the resulting annular                     
              space and the nitrogen-sodium mixture through the steel                        
              tubing.  The analytical system will be centered around an NDIR                 
              instrument for N2O, with the analytical train also including a                 
              CO analyzer, a Pulsed Fluorescent SO2 analyzer, and a                          
              Chemiluminescent NOx analyzer.  Successful completion of the                   
              Phase I studies will provide a lab-scale demonstration of the                  
              process and provide a clear understanding of the chemistry                     
              involved.                                                                      
                                                                                             
              Considerable effort has been expended on development of fluid                  
              bed combustion technology for burning of coal with low SOx and                 
              NOx emissions.  Unfortunately, this technology approach leads                  
              to production of copious amounts of N2O emissions, an                          
              unacceptably serious drawback since N2O is both a greenhouse                   
              gas and a major contributor to depletion of the ozone layer.                   
              Accordingly, development of a means of dealing with this                       
              problem is of major importance to the viability of fluidized                   
              bed combustors for burning of coal.
