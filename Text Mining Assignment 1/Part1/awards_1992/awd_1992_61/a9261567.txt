Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Carbon fiber-reinforced in SiC whisker-reinforced molybdenum                   
              disilicide (MoSi2) matrix composites have been identified as                   
              excellent candidates for high temperature structural applications              
              in oxidizing environments.  However, the room temperature fracture             
              toughness and high temperature yield and creep strength of these               
              materials can still be drastically improved, and processing issues             
              must be resolved.  In this Phase I proposal, Ultramet proposes to              
              demonstrate the feasibility of several fabrication methods for                 
              MoSi2 matrix composites that are capable of eliminating the major              
              sources of processing flaws and of greatly increasing process                  
              repeatability and cost-effectiveness, while enhancing mechanical               
              properties.  MoSi2-coated whiskers and MoSi2-infiltrated carbon                
              fabric will be fabricated by chemical vapor deposition (CVD) with              
              several alloy microstructures, followed by properties measurements.            
              These results will be compared to available data for SiC/MoSi2,                
              C/C, and C/SiC materials, and an analysis of cost, reliability,                
              fabricability, and performance will be conducted.                              
                                                                                             
              The most immediate application for MoSi2 composites for engine hot             
              section components, and industrial furnace equipment is another                
              potential market.  Also, with upcoming EPA requirements for                    
              drastically reduced emissions, new materials such as MoSi2 will be             
              required in much greater quantities to withstand the higher                    
              temperatures associated with clean-burning, low-Nox technology.
