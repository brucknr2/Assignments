Abstract    :
              The objective of this project is to develop a method of image                  
              compression offering advantages over the more traditional                      
              vector-based algorithms (transform coding and vector quantization).            
              It is expected that the blocking artifact can be eliminated and                
              edge fidelity can be improved.  Further, the multiresolution                   
              representation itself provides a solution to many imaging                      
              applications which need to handle the same image at different                  
              resolutions for display, printing or browsing, for example.  This              
              research could provide a technique for designing optimal filters               
              for multiresolution coding; it is expected that optimal filters                
              will be designed and applied to typical imagery.  The algorithm                
              could provide the basis for more effective commercial compression              
              subsytems, critical to the success of electronic imaging in                    
              computer and consumer applications.
