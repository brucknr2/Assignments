Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              An experimental and theoretical investigation is proposed for                  
              the use of metal foams as heat transfer devices.  The proposed                 
              research will address the following areas:  (1) Experimental                   
              determination of the utilization of metal foams as heat                        
              transfer enhancement devices.  (2) Development of a                            
              theoretical model for the effectiveness of metal foams as heat                 
              transfer enhancement devices.  (3) Optimization of the effect                  
              of metal foam porosity on the heat transfer process.
