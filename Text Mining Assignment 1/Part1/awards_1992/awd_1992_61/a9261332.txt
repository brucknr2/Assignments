Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Computing systems that use complex graphic and image based                     
              information require the storage and retrieval of very large data               
              files.  Optical disk systems offer the largest storage capacity of             
              any random access storage system, but widespread use, especially in            
              the PC market, has not occurred because of their high cost.  A                 
              major cost item in these drives is the high power laser diode they             
              require.  This cost can be dramatically reduced by developing more             
              sensitive optical recording media so that lower power, less                    
              expensive laser diodes can be used.                                            
                                                                                             
              We plan to apply materials and device design concepts we have                  
              developed in the course of our study of phase change materials to              
              develop erasable optical recording media suitable for use with                 
              lower power, less expensive laser diodes.  These materials will                
              have rapid crystallization kinetics and stability in both                      
              structural phases.  This new phase change erasable media will have             
              potential application in business and technical computing, as well             
              as interactive education and entertainment systems.  This superior             
              technology provides an excellent opportunity to compete in markets             
              recognized for major growth over the next decade.
