Abstract    :
              Accurate Automation will investigate a new                                     
              control architecture in which a neural network                                 
              is used to set the coefficients of the Youla                                   
              parameter for the controller.  By so doing one                                 
              achieves all of the "design by learning" benefits                              
              associated with neural control while                                           
              simultaneously guaranteeing that the resultant                                 
              system will be stable.  Moreover, the proposed                                 
              network automatically updates the Youla                                        
              parameter whenever a new reference input or                                    
              performance criteria is specified.                                             
                                                                                             
              Specific research objectives include the:                                      
              -  development of neural network architectures                                 
                 and training methods applicable to the                                      
                 proposed system,                                                            
              -  formulation of methods for updating the                                     
                 network training each time this system is                                   
                 operated,                                                                   
              -  implementation the controller as an auto-                                   
                 reconfigurable system, and                                                  
              -  application of the proposed neural controller                               
                 to flight control systems and robotics.
