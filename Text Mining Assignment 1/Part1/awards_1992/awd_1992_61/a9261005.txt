Abstract    :
              Boron phosphide (BP) is a                                                      
              semiconductor with a wide band gap,                                            
              and exceptional physical                                                       
              properties, including a melting                                                
              point greater than 3,000oC, high                                               
              temperature oxidation resistance,                                              
              chemical stability, high thermal                                               
              conductivity and extreme hardness.                                             
              These attributes make it attractive                                            
              for use in harsh environments.                                                 
              Unfortunately, these same physical                                             
              properties make it extremely                                                   
              difficult to synthesize by                                                     
              conventional methods.  The                                                     
              objective of this project is to                                                
              synthesize single crystal epitaxial                                            
              BP layers on <100> silicon                                                     
              substrates using                                                               
              electrocrystallization.                                                        
              Electrocrystallization from molten                                             
              salt melts allows the growth of                                                
              single crystal layers at low                                                   
              temperatures (700-1000oC).  Because                                            
              the crystallization process is                                                 
              driven electrically instead of                                                 
              thermally, extraordinary fine                                                  
              control can be exercised over the                                              
              deposition rate and composition.                                               
              Also, the process can be readily                                               
              scaled up to produce large wafers                                              
              or boules.
