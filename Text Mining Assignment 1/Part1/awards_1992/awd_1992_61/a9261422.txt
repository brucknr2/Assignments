Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is              
              in the general area of Analytical and Surface Chemistry and in the             
              subfield of chemical sensors.  The objective of this research is               
              to determine the feasibility of detecting ultratrace levels of the             
              highly toxic hydride gases arsine and phosphine by taking                      
              advantage of the reversible interaction of these gases with noble              
              metal surfaces.  Arsine and phosphine are extremely toxic with                 
              threshold values for human exposure as low as 50 parts per                     
              billion. The lower detection limits for existing technologies are              
              only about 10-30 parts per billion, leaving too small a margin for             
              error.  In contrast, the surface detectors to be developed in this             
              project are simple, small, relatively inexpensive, fast, and                   
              highly sensitive.  Preliminary experiments have demonstrated that              
              detection limits may be reduced up to three orders of magnitude                
              over those attainable with currently available technology.  This               
              Phase I research will focus on the dependence of sensor response               
              on detector type, film thickness, nature of substrate,                         
              temperature, and interferences, so that one method can be selected             
              for more complete characterization and prototype development                   
              during Phase II.

              This research should demonstrate the feasibility of novel                      
              technology that could help establish the U.S. as a leader in                   
              ultratrace detection.  This technology could be used worldwide by              
              the semiconductor industry and their chemical suppliers for                    
              improved safety and process control as well as for monitoring                  
              highly toxic arsine in natural gas.
