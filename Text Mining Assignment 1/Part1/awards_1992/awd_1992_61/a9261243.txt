Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  The PI wishes to devise an accurate means for measuring                   
              relative humidity in clouds, because this parameter is essential in            
              the evolution of cloud microphysics.  This proposal is to develop              
              a new RH sensor capable of meeting this need.  The sensor is based             
              on the optical measurement of haze droplets as they respond in size            
              to changes in ambient RH; an accuracy of the RH measurement of +/-             
              0.02% is anticipated, with RH values > 100% also being measured.               
                                                                                             
                   A prototype sensor for field use will be devised, designed,               
              and fabricated using recent advances in laser diode technology.                
              Research will be conducted to make possible the sensor's                       
              survivability under atmospheric conditions with high wind speed and            
              large hydrometeors.  Tests of the sensor will be conducted in                  
              atmospheric clouds under supersaturated conditions.                            
                                                                                             
                   The goal of this work is to develop and test a RH sensor for              
              incloud use.  If this work leads to a practical prototype, it is               
              anticipated that a commercial version would find significant use in            
              the cloud research community.
