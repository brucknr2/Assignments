Abstract    :
              Recent advances in material development have brought us a full                 
              class of "smart materials."  Active noise and vibration control                
              is one application for which these materials are well suited.  In              
              fact, for actuators, terfenol-D is the smart material that we                  
              believe holds the most promise for many future applications                    
              because of its large displacement capabilities.  Terfenol-D can                
              also produce large forces compared to other actuator materials                 
              The major disadvantage of a terfenol-D actuator, however, is high              
              distortion.                                                                    
                                                                                             
              A method to linearize this type of nonlinear device will be                    
              developed by integrating a nonlinear inverse filter based on a                 
              Volterra expansion into a linear type feedback control system.                 
              Phase I work will strive to prove that this concept will work by               
              measuring the uncontrolled response of an actuator, designing the              
              control system in real-time on the actuator.                                   
                                                                                             
              Proof of the effectiveness of this type of control approach will               
              be beneficial in controlling any nonlinear system that is                      
              stationary.  The particular application of the terfenol-D                      
              actuator was chosen because of the investigators familiarity with              
              the type of nonlinearities in actuators.
