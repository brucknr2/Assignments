Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              A wet thermal oxidation process for direct conversion of                       
              Refuse Derived Fuel (residual material following separation of                 
              paper, cardboard, glass, plastic bottles, and steel and                        
              aluminum cans from raw Solid Municipal Waste) to energy,                       
              saving dewatering and drying expenses encountered in more                      
              conventional methods, under conditions highly conducive to                     
              destruction of gaseous pollutants will be studied.  Phase I                    
              efforts will center on concentration of the Refuse Derived                     
              Fuel slurry to a maximum pumpable solids loading of about 15%,                 
              followed by heating under pressure to carbonize the organic                    
              material, reducing its water affinity and permitting further                   
              concentration to approximately 45% solids loading (this level                  
              to be confirmed in batch carbonization tests in this study                     
              phase).  Following successful completion of these tasks, Phase                 
              II efforts will be focused on thermal oxidation of the                         
              carbonized slurry from Phase I at high pressure and                            
              temperature in a continuous process, with the liberated heat                   
              being used to generate and superheat steam for power                           
              generation.  Specific objectives of the Phase I effort are:                    
              (1) Establish maximum solids concentrations for a pumpable raw                 
              RDF/water slurry; (2) Establish optimum conditions for RDF wet                 
              carbonization to supply high concentration slurry for                          
              subsequent wet oxidation; (3) Evaluate effects of wet                          
              carbonization on the chemical and physical properties of the                   
              RDF; and, (4) Characterize gas and water effluent streams from                 
              wet carbonization.                                                             
                                                                                             
              Municipal Solid Waste is a growing national problem, currently                 
              without a good solution.  The energy contained in Municipal                    
              Solid Waste produced in the United States is roughly                           
              equivalent to a million barrels of imported oil per day.  The                  
              combination of wet resource recovery and wet thermal oxidation                 
              to be studies in this program offers a potential of neatly and                 
              economically disposing of Municipal Solid Waste with                           
              negligible pollution with recovery of significant anergy                       
              resources.
