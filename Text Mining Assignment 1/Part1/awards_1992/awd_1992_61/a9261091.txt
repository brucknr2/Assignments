Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  With the increase in atmospheric pollution and a new, growing             
              public awareness of resulting environmental damage, there is a need            
              for new technology to measure the concentration of trace species in            
              the atmosphere.  Extractive methods, in which a sealed sample of               
              air is analyzed in a laboratory, are expensive and are inapplicable            
              to continuous, in situ monitoring of concentrations.  Science                  
              Research Laboratory proposes the development of an instrument                  
              called a Pulsed Absorption Diffractometer (PAD) to fill this need.             
              The basis of this instrument is the detection of a transient,                  
              volumetric diffraction grating that is formed after a pulsed laser             
              beam is absorbed by trace species present in the illuminated                   
              region.  The PAD will be sensitive to parts-per-trillion trace-gas             
              concentrations, 2-3 orders of magnitude better than instruments                
              based on other approaches to monitor trace species in the field.
