Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Beta-Silicon Carbide has been known for many years to have                     
              excellent theoretical properties for the production of high power              
              microwave devices.  The combination of its wide bandgap, high                  
              saturated electron drift velocity, high breakdown electric field,              
              low dielectric constant and high thermal conductivity give it a                
              figure of merit for high power microwave applications that is                  
              1100 times better than that of silicon and 183 times better than               
              that of gallium arsenide.                                                      
                                                                                             
              The primary advantage of beta silicon carbide is higher carrier                
              mobility which, for electrons, has been measured and calculated                
              to be high.  Another advantage junction power devices is the                   
              lower junction barrier because of the smaller bandgap.  Also the               
              resistance for contacts developed to date are lower for 3 cubic                
              structures than for 6 hexagonal structures.  Thus, the beta-form               
              is more desirable for high frequency, high power applications.                 
              However, a process for growing high quality boules of beta-                    
              silicon carbide from which to fabricate wafers and devices has                 
              not been developed.  It is proposed to evaluate two different                  
              approaches for growth of beta-silicon carbide single crystal                   
              boules during Phase I.  Further development of the most promising              
              process will be the primary Phase II objective.
