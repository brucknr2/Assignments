Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Passive restraint government standards have resulted in the                    
              introduction of passenger side airbags for most cars in 1993.                  
              TIP Engineering has initiated a significant amount of R&D                      
              activity in developing the next state of the art passenger                     
              airbags (PAB) deployment door without any visible cut lines.                   
              The concept is referred to as the hidden seam deployment door.                 
                                                                                             
              The major parameter of a successful hidden seam door function is               
              the scoring of the back surface of the skin.   Present technology              
              can only accomplish this criteria by mechanical means.  TIP would              
              cut the skin by the use of a heat/energy/pressure pyrotechnic)                 
              device to the back surface of the skin.  At the time the airbag                
              is fired, the same command signal would initiate the pyrotechnic               
              device to ignite creating an instant cut line along the periphery              
              of the airbag opening.  The pyrotechnic devices presently being                
              considered are used primarily in the defense industry as an                    
              initiator to an explosive device.                                              
                                                                                             
              We propose to significantly revise and redevelop these devices                 
              for application on the airbag door.  The anticipated benefits are              
              to improve safety, warranty, and obvious styling improvement at a              
              reduced cost.
