Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project                 
              will develop computer software and a companion textbook to teach               
              modeling of biological problems using a simulation language that               
              is expressed in biological terms.  The thrust of the project is                
              to incorporate pedagogical and electronic devices to promote                   
              critical thinking skills, thus rising above the drill and                      
              practice and tutorial software that comprises the existing                     
              market.  The open architecture of the software will permit                     
              students to challenge assumptions in models, to propose their own              
              hypotheses, and to test these hypotheses by developing their own               
              biological models.
