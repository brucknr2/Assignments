Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Silicon carbide is a leading new candidate for mirror blanks                   
              because of its high stiffness, relatively high thermal                         
              conductivity, and abrasion resistance.  This base material contains            
              pores or large grains, which make it difficult to provide a smooth             
              front surface.  A process has been developed for using electron                
              cyclotron resonance chemical vapor deposition to deposit very                  
              smooth amorphous silicon carbide (SiC) on 100 mm substrates.  This             
              material is easily polished to obtain a 10-20A rms surface                     
              roughness.  This process will be scaled up to coat large diameter              
              optics.  The main problems associated with scale up involved plasma            
              gas dynamics and fluid flows.  As part of this program, we will                
              develop a general computational model that will be used for                    
              designing the gas delivery system.  We will then modify an existing            
              system to coat large-area optics with smooth, amorphous SiC.
