Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  The PI will prepare environmentally degradable radar chaff                
              made from aerogel solids.  The chaff will have wing loadings, grams            
              per square meter, tailored to be one of two orders of magnitude                
              less than is possible with present thin film coated chaff.  The                
              design flexibility of the novel chaff will allow more extensive and            
              stable measurements of atmospheric phenomena than are now possible.            
              The capability to control the fall rate will enhance the ability to            
              make reproducible measurements.                                                
                                                                                             
                   The benign coated aerogel chaff is naturally degraded by                  
              environmental moisture and does not require bacterial action or                
              special treatment to assure biogradability.
