Abstract    :
                   The research project of John Harer is concerned with three                
              major topics:                                                                  
                   The first topic is the homology of the mapping class group                
              and related groups such as the Torelli group and the level-n                   
              mapping class groups.                                                          
                   The second topic is the Reshetikhin-Turaev invariant of a 3-              
              manifold and the associated representations of the mapping class               
              groups.                                                                        
                   The third is an attempt to find an automatic structure for                
              the mapping class group.  (This is joint with S. P. Kerckhoff of               
              Stanford University.)                                                          
                   The study of 3-manifolds is a very natural geometric                      
              pursuit.  We live in one, ignoring the time dimension, so it                   
              could even have cosmological implications.
