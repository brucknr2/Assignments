Abstract    :
                                                                                              
               NorthWestNet originated as a six state network for                           
              supercomputer users.  In three years it has increased from 10                  
              connected sites to over 50 sites with varying levels of                        
              connectivity.  In the third year of the orginal award, the                     
              directors of the Northwest Academic Computing Consortium                       
              undertook a strategic planning  process to evaluate NorthWestNet               
              and set a course for the next 5 years.  The plan is to extend                  
              NorthWestNet to a much wider user community to include all levels              
              of higher education, primary and secondary school districts,                   
              researchers in the business and non-profit world, and the                      
              education comunity in general.                                                 
                                                                                             
                Continued funding will enable NorthWestNet to expand                         
              membership; move toward becoming a value-added service-oriented                
              network; add new users within the current membership; and hire                 
              professional executive management.   NorthWestNet will hire a                  
              professional executive director to assist in implementing the                  
              strategic plan which includes the generation of five times the                 
              dues revenue of the immediate past fiscal year.***//
