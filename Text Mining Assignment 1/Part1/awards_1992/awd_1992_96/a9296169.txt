Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This proposal is to make helium masurements on the World                       
              Ocean Circulation Experiment (WOCE) cruises in the southeastern                
              Pacific on longitudes 88 and 150 west.  The helium data are                    
              useful as tracers of the deep ocean circulation, particularly in               
              regions near the east Pacific rise from which elemental helium is              
              known to emanate.  These measurements, along with hydrographic                 
              and other tracer measurements will form the basis for ocean                    
              circulation descriptions which are the principal objectives of                 
              WOCE.
