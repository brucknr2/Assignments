Abstract    :
              This planning grant, submitted in conjunction with the Minority                
              Research initiation program, will provide support to develop a                 
              research proposal to use the techniques of discrete field mechanics            
              to develop closed form solutions for the dynamic stability analysis            
              of X-braced and Warren truss three-dimensional lattices.
