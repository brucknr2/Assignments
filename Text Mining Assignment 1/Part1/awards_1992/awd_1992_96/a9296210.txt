Abstract    :
              This project is intended to document 1) the degree of temporal                 
              variability for 3He/4He ratios in historic and dated lava flows,               
              over timescales ranging from 1 year to >100,000 years, 2) the                  
              relationship between He and the radiogenic isotopes of Pb, Sr and              
              Nd, and 3) the variations in 3He/4He and rare gas abundances for               
              hotsprings, fumaroles and igneous rocks.  Mount Etna is among the              
              best documented volcanoes in the world and provides an excellent               
              natural laboratory for helium isotope and rare gas studies.  The               
              results should provide insight into the dynamics of upper mantle-              
              lithosphere-crust interactions beneath Mount Etna, and                         
              constraints on the chemical evolution of the magmatic                          
              reservoir(s) and their degassing history.
