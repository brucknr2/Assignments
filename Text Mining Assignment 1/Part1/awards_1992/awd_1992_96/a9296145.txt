Abstract    :
              This project utilizes recent developments in dynamical systems                 
              theory in the analysis of engineering dynamics problems.                       
              Specifically, local and global bifurcation techniques are used to              
              predict dynamics behavior as a function of system parameters, as               
              well as to describe them.  The research focuses on four classes                
              of systems, including the use of input waveform for the                        
              suppression of chaos in periodically forced oscillators, the                   
              stability of modes at rest in systems which have active modes                  
              undergoing chaotic dynamics, nonlinear dynamic interactions in                 
              rotating mechanical systems, and simple models for the dynamic                 
              response of mechanisms with flexible linkages.  A widening gap                 
              between theoretical developments and applications in the field of              
              nonlinear dynamics has occurred in recent years.  This research                
              is a direct attempt to bridge that gap by employing modern                     
              analytical and numerical tools in the investigation of specific                
              mechanical systems.
