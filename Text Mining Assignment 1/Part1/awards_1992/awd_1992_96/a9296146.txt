Abstract    :
              Although the physical principles of motion are generally well                  
              understood, adequate methods for controlling motion in computer                
              simulations to achieve specified goals or to satisfy general                   
              constraints do not exist.  The primary objective of this research              
              project is to develop means that will allow scientists to exercise a           
              high level of control over dynamic models.  This is achieved by                
              generalizing the formulation, generation, and satisfaction of                  
              constraint equations to create an intuitive interface between the user         
              and the computer.  An abstract definition of constraints will                  
              encompass force constraints, explicit motion requirements, energy              
              minimization, and style considerations.  Assemblies of rigid or                
              flexible bodies, representing forms ranging from human figures to              
              mechnical linkages, form the domain of the geometric models studied.           
              The underlying description of the assemblies encompasses both                  
              simplified polygonal representations for prototyping and exact B-              
              spline sculptured surfaces to represent mechanical and other figures.          
              Numerical methods found within Finite Element Analysis, particularly           
              the method of weighted residuals, are studied as a basis for                   
              permitting interactive teamwork between the scientist and the machine.
