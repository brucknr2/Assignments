Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Plasmolipin is a protein located in the membrane of nerve cells                
              in the central nervous system.  In brain, plasmolipin is                       
              developmentally regulated and concentrated in myelin.  In vitro,               
              the isolated protein forms voltage-dependent channels which                    
              allows potassium to cross the membrane.  The concentration of                  
              potassium, inside and outside the cell, is critical for proper                 
              cell function.  The goal of this research is to investigate the                
              cellular and molecular events that control the expression and                  
              function of plasmolipin.  Several cDNA clones encoding                         
              plasmolipin have been isolated and partially sequenced.                        
              Experiments will be performed to complete the sequence in order                
              to determine the topology of plasmolipin in relation to membrane               
              domains and the genetic structure.  Dr. Fischer will study the                 
              molecular mechanisms that regulate plasmolipin and examine the                 
              role of this protein during oligodendrocyte differentiation and                
              during the early events of myelination.  Results from this study               
              will provide information on the function of plasmolipin in                     
              encoding messages in the nervous system.
