Abstract    :
              This proposal represents an ROW career advancement award to gain               
              training in techniques in molecular biology to apply to ongoing                
              studies on the taxonomy and evolutionary history of calcareous                 
              algae of coral reefs, in particular representatives of the genus,              
              Halimeda. The classical taxonomy of Halimeda and other calcareous              
              members of the Bryopsidalean algae is unusually difficult. The                 
              Bryopsidalean algae do not have clear sexual characteristics that              
              can be readily used to separate species and the full life cycle                
              for many species has not been worked out. This award will permit               
              the  acquisition of the methodologies currently being applied to               
              understanding taxonomy and diversity in other organisms, to test               
              key hypotheses concerning the relationships within this                        
              interesting and important group of marine algae.
