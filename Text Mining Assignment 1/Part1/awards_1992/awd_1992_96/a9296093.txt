Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The rocky subtidal zone of temperate coasts is characterized by                
              complex topography and equally heterogeneous distributions of                  
              marine algae and invertebrates.  Long-term studies of subtidal                 
              rock walls (1987-1988) in Northern Massachusetts have produced                 
              and tested hypotheses concerning the long-term stability and                   
              short-term regulation of community structure on such substrata.                
              Previous studies have focused on the interactions between                      
              species on rock walls, on the population biology of a few                      
              dominant species, and on the effects of water movement on                      
              individual, population, and community processes.  The present                  
              this research will extend the long-term studies including a                    
              detailed analysis of separated population on nearby rock walls,                
              and populations in contact with competing species.  A                          
              mathematical model of the subtidal rock wall community will be                 
              developed.  New information is needed on the role of larval                    
              dispersal and recruitment in this system, and its influence on                 
              the maintenance of patchiness of invertebrated populations.                    
              There are clearly three levels of larval dispersal (adjacent,                  
              local, regional) that affect population dynamics and thus                      
              community structure.  These will be investigated using a                       
              combination of field studies, laboratory investigations, and                   
              modelling of large scale flow patterns and to incorporate the                  
              results into a realistic community model.
