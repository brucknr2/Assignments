Abstract    :
                   This is a collaborative effort between Lamont-Doherty                     
              Geological Observatory and UCSB to study the magnetic behavior of              
              pseudosingle domain particles.  The work will utilize magnetic                 
              measurements on individual particles coupled with domain                       
              observations.  The magnetic measurements will be extended from                 
              remanence measurements to weak field susceptibility and                        
              hysteresis determination.  The particular topics are the                       
              following:  1.  Additional tests of the existence of metastable                
              single-domain like states in IRM(s), TRM and VRM.  2.  The                     
              relationship between temperature dependence of domain structure                
              and the TRM blocking process.  3.  The physical nature of                      
              nucleation and pinning sites.  4.  The role of nucleation in                   
              determining the response of PSD material to AF demagnetization.                
              The last topic will lead to the application of new ideas on                    
              behavior of PSD particles to the interpretation of NRM.
