Abstract    :
              The purpose of this research is to develop semi-parametric                     
              methods for the estimation of sample selection models.  These                  
              methods will allow for the simultaneous estimation of choice                   
              equations and outcome equations.  In addition to the estimation                
              of the two equations sample-selection models, the estimation of                
              more complicated sample-selection models will also be considered.              
              All of these models have certain features in common, but they                  
              also have structures of their own.  Such structures impose                     
              specific identification restrictions on the models.  This project              
              will develop semi-parametric estimation methods which explore the              
              systematic structures of the models.  Some of the systematic                   
              estimation methods to be investigated are the semi-parametric                  
              likelihood methods.  Monte Carlo experiments will be performed to              
              investigate the small sample performance of the proposed                       
              estimators.   This research is important because sample-selection              
              models have many important applications, such as in the analysis               
              of job-search behavior, and the methods to be developed will                   
              permit for better estimating these and other models.
