Abstract    :
                   An integral component of the multi-agency U.S. Global Change              
              Research Program (Our Changing Planet," Committee on Earth                     
              Sciences, 1991) is understanding and modeling the geospace                     
              environment.  As part of its contribution to the U.S. Global                   
              Change  Research Program, the National Science Foundation's                    
              Division of Atmospheric Sciences has established a new research                
              initiative,  Geospace Environment Modeling (GEM), with the goal                
              of supporting basic research into the dynamical and structural                 
              properties of geospace, leading to the construction of a global                
              geospace model with predictive capability.                                     
                   The subjects of the first GEM campaign are the                            
              magnetospheric boundary, the magnetosheath beyond it, and the                  
              connection from the boundary through the magnetosphere to the                  
              ionosphere.  Recent observation suggest that waves generated in                
              the vicinity of the magnetopause and boundary layer regions may                
              be transported into the polar cusp.  THis grant involves the                   
              study of compressional wave propagation from a generation region               
              near the magnetopause into the polar cusp and an examination of                
              the instabilities associated with ion injected into the polar                  
              cusp from the magnetosheat.  For both studies a primary                        
              consideration will be to compare the results with observed                     
              magnetic pulsation signatures.
