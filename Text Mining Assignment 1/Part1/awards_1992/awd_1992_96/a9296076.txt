Abstract    :
              The purpose of this program is to: 1) provide disabled children                
              and adults with an improved educational experience and a more                  
              self-sufficient capability,  2) provide superlative training for               
              the engineering student who designs, builds and implements a                   
              device to help a person in need; this "real world" experience                  
              will certainly generate great motivation and foster an                         
              engineering education with a unique sense of purpose and pride,                
              3) provide the engineering school with an opportunity to perform               
              a unique service to the community,  4) provide the bioengineering              
              academic community an opportunity to build infrastructure within               
              the university.
