Abstract    :
                   The principal investigator will study the algebraic structure             
              of twistor spaces, the construction of Kahler Einstein metrics and             
              application of Kahler reduction. The methods to be employed are a              
              combination of differential geometry and algebraic techniques. A               
              twistor space is a complex three dimensional space associated to a             
              self-dual Riemannian four dimensional manifold. The principal                  
              investigator will study those twistor spaces associated with the               
              connected sums of complex projective planes. The principal                     
              investigator will also study the construction of Kahler Einstein               
              metrics on spaces admitting a one parameter group of symmetries.               
                   The general theory of relativity is set in spaces in which                
              curvature is proportional to stress. These spaces, called Einstein             
              manifolds, arise in many branches of mathematics and it is useful              
              to know when a given space has the structure of an Einstein space.             
              The principal investigator will study this question as well as the             
              structure of other spaces which arise in mathematical physics.
