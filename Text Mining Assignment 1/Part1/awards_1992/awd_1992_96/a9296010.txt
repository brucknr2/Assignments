Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The magnocellular neuroendocrine system is a very important                    
              region of the hypothalamus which is involved in control of                     
              uterine contractions during parturition, the milk let-down                     
              reflex, and maternal behavior via oxytocin as well as the                      
              regulation of fluid homeostasis, vasoconstriction, stress                      
              responses, and possibly memory via vasopressin.  The release of                
              oxytocin and vasopressin are governed by the activity of these                 
              large magnocellular neurons.  Dr. Weiss will identify the inputs               
              to these neurons in normal animals since it is likely that the                 
              afferents play an critical role in determining their activity.                 
              He will then examine the influence of lactation and water                      
              deprivation on these synaptic inputs.  Discerning the synaptic                 
              plasticity following physiological stimuli will contribute                     
              greatly to our knowledge of how the brain organizes actions and                
              maintains our vital functions.  Given the relationship of this                 
              hypothalamic region to regulation of fluid balance and the                     
              cardiovascular system, basic research may lead to better                       
              understanding of the neural regulation of hypertension and heart               
              disease which are a major cause of death in middle-age males in                
              our society.
