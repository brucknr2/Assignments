Abstract    :
                   For some genes, alternative splicing is a major control                   
              point for gene expression.  That is, splicing patterns change                  
              with differences in cell-type, or during the development of an                 
              organism.  The biochemical mechanism and the biological                        
              strategy by which mRNA splicing event will be the focus here. A                
              model system, the preprotachykinin gene, has been chosen for                   
              investigation.  It produces a single pre-mRNA that is spliced                  
              differently in primary  sensory neurons compared to other cell                 
              types.  Studies will be aimed at the interaction of pre-mRNAs                  
              with cellular factors isolated from extracts of different cell-                
              types.  Intact cells will be explored, Established cell lines                  
              will be used, some of which exhibit a neuronal phenotype and                   
              others which differentiate into primary sensory neurons in                     
              culture after induction with nerve growth factor.
