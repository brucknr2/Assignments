Abstract    :
              This grant provides support for Prof. Banerjee under the Foundation's          
              Presidential Young Investigator (PYI) program.  His research concerns          
              the problems of wave propagation in nonlinear and dispersive media and         
              their numerical simulation on computers.  He is also interested in             
              acousto-optics and optical information processing, including the optical       
              interconnection problem.                                                       
                                                                                             
              The PYI Awards program provides research support to the Nation's most          
              outstanding and promising young science and engineering faculty.  The          
              awards are intended to improve the capability of U. S. academic                
              institutions to respond to the demand for highly qualified science and         
              engineering personnel for academic and industrial research and                 
              engineering.  This PYI has made significant contributions to his field         
              of engineering and has potential to become a leader in academic research       
              and education.                                                                 
              The diary note describes the rigorous selection procedure.  A basic            
              grant award in the amount $25000 is highly recommended.
