Abstract    :
              This Research Initiation Award is for analysis of time-varying                 
              imagery when the camera and light source are both moving relative              
              to objects in a scene.  This extends optic-flow techniques                     
              developed for camera or object motion with a constant light                    
              source.  Applications include passive vision in outer space and                
              active vision under water or in reconnaisance situations.                      
              Industrial robotic applications may also be developed.
