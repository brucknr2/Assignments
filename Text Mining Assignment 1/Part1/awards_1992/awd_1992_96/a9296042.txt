Abstract    :
                      This research is in two topics.  The first is the development of       
              supercomputing algorithms for micro-gravity liquid-metal flows that            
              solve the mass, momentum, and energy equations for single phase liquid         
              metal transport in space reactor systems.  This work is also sponsored         
              by Cray Research, Inc.  The second topic is investigations into a              
              artificial intelligence method and expert system technology for                
              certain needs in the nuclear power industry.  These include                    
              methodology for processing massive amounts of data and reduction of            
              data to symbolic knowledge and real-time issues in knowledge based             
              systems.
