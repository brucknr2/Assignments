Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The PIs will measure He, Ne, Ar, Kr, and Xe isotopes, rare gas                 
              concentrations, visicle size distributions and C/3He ratios in                 
              glassy basalts from four regions of the mid-ocean ridge system.                
              Well preserved, glassy basalts will be analyzed by stepwise heating            
              and in vacuo crushing techniques.  The isotopic compositions and               
              abundances of rare gases, in conjunction with other chemical                   
              parameters will provide insight into magma transport and volatile              
              injection at ridge crests, and into the origins and scales of the              
              components contributing to mantle heterogeneity and to the                     
              petrogenesis of oceanic crust.
