Abstract    :
              Research will be undertaken to understand and control instabilities            
              in the performance of turbopumps.  The investigation will be                   
              primarily experimental, with a limited complement of theoretical and           
              numerical analysis.  The source of the instabilities, whether system           
              or component-related, and fluid characteristics, particularly                  
              cavitation, will be studied using laser anemometry and flow                    
              visualization techniques, among others.  The researcher is a                   
              Presidential Young Investigator, and he is in his first year of his            
              PYI grant.
