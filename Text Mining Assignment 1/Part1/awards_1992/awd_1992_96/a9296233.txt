Abstract    :
              The P. element transposon of Drosophila melanogaster is of                     
              importance for transformation of the fruitfly but is also of                   
              intrinsic interest as a biological phenomenon.  It has been                    
              described at the molecular and genetic level by several                        
              laboratories.  The transposon moves only in somatic cells                      
              although it is present in germ line cells.  The answer to                      
              that mystery was found to lie in the processing of the                         
              transcript.  The transcript contains three introns and in                      
              somatic cells, all three are processed out to form a mature                    
              mRNA.  In germ line cells, one of the introns is not                           
              processed out and the mature message is not completed.  The                    
              present study is directed towards understanding the genetic                    
              control of P. element transposition using an integrated                        
              approach utilizing genetics, biochemistry and molecular                        
              biology.  An attempt will be made to develop an in vitro                       
              system in order to study the biochemical mechanism of                          
              transposition as well as the factors involved with                             
              differential splicing events.                                                  
                                                                                             
              This study should result in greater insights into gene                         
              regulation at the cellular and genetic levels.
