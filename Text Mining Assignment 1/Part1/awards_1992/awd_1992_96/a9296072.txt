Abstract    :
              This is a novel electrical engineering approach to the difficult               
              problem of determining the physical condition of a bone by a                   
              non-invasive electromagnetic measurement.  A new era is                        
              emerging, namely, non-invasive detection of incipient failure                  
              of biological and non-biological structures without the use of                 
              ionizing radiation.  This proposal suggests a new means for                    
              accomplishing this goal.  It is clear that this is a high-risk                 
              high-gain research proposal.  If successful, this type of                      
              research could revolutionize diagnosis in bone disease and                     
              healing.
