Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The PIs will perform analysis of shapes and amplitude of marine                
              magnetic anomalies of the past 5 m.y. around the world to                      
              estimate the size of then non-diaploe component of Earth's                     
              magnetic field. A recently developed inversion technique will                  
              be used. Existing data shows large systemic errors in global                   
              plated reconstructions. This work will be an initial attempt to                
              correct the situation.
