Abstract    :
                   The Vespidae ("paper wasps") are a family of extraordinarily              
              diverse social insects that construct nests with varied and                    
              intricate architecture.  The social behavior of this tropical                  
              group has been studied intensively, but only a fraction of the                 
              many species known have been described and classified.  Dr. James              
              Carpenter will be amassing a database of adult, larval, and nest               
              characteristics from species in tropical Central and South                     
              America, Africa, and southeast Asia.  These data will be                       
              incorporated into an analysis of the evolutionary relationships                
              of these diverse species and genera.                                           
                   The proposed research will find a wide audience among                     
              entomologists, ecologists, biogeographers, behaviorists, and                   
              evolutionary biologists.  In addition to clarifying our                        
              understanding of a diverse tropical group of organisms, the                    
              evolutionary framework that results will be an invaluable basis                
              for comparative research in the future.
