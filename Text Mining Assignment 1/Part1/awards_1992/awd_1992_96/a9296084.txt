Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              People Sharing Information Network, PSInet, is a National                      
              Computer Conferencing Network for Science and Mathematics                      
              Education which currently links all State Science                              
              Supervisors, a number of science education agencies, and                       
              which has intra-state networks in place in six states.  This                   
              project will extend PSInet capabilities to the State                           
              Mathematics Supervisors and to the Presidential Award Winners                  
              for Excellence in Science and Mathematics Teaching.  In                        
              addition, intra-state networks will be established in the 44                   
              states which are currently not "on-line".  Cost Sharing in                     
              the amount of $650,000 is 97% of the NSF contribution.
