Abstract    :
              This Presidential Young Investigator award will support                        
              theoretical research at the boundary of high-energy particle                   
              physics and cosmology.  A solution to the puzzle of what                       
              constitutes the "missing mass" in galactic halos may come from                 
              the fundamental theories of particle physics.  These theories                  
              also make predictions as to the scale and amplitude of deviations              
              from uniformity in the Cosmic Microwave Background radiation.                  
              This outstanding young theoretician will give her attention to                 
              these problems, in hope of contributing to their solution.
