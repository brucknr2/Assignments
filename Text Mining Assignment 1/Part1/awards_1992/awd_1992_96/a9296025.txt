Abstract    :
                   Often precipitation systems are organized into banded                     
              structures.  These structures include hurricane rainbands and                  
              precipitation bands associated with low pressure centers.  Often               
              the heaviest precipitation occurs in these bands.                              
                   It is believed that banded structures are associated with                 
              instabilities in the atmosphere know as conditional symmetric                  
              instability (CSI).  Using an advanced numerical model, the                     
              Principal Investigator will continue a line of research that                   
              involves assessing various atmospheric forcing terms and how they              
              effect the CSI.  Special attention will be paid to radiation and               
              surface forcing terms                                                          
                   If successful, this research will provide better                          
              understanding and potentially better prediction of banded                      
              precipitation structures.
