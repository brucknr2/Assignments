Abstract    :
                   CO2-H2O immiscibility to depths of > 30 km should be a                    
              direct result of the depression of isotherms that occurs during                
              active transport of material down a subduction zone.  Fluid phase              
              separation in this environment should have a number of important               
              consequences for the thermal, mechanical, and metamorphic                      
              development of subduction zones, yet the effect documenting the                
              extent to which fluid immiscibility controls petrologic processes              
              at high pressure.  Particular attention will be paid to                        
              determining whether small-scale interlaying of blueschist and                  
              greenschist and blueschist and eclogite assemblages results from               
              generation and preservation of fluid heterogeneities and whether               
              such heterogeneities could be caused by fluid phase separation.                
              The approach taken will be (1) to use mineral phase equilibria to              
              calculate a (H20) and a (C02) ratios between adjacent layers both              
              within facies  types and across facies boundaries, (2) to                      
              determine fluid compositions directly from multiple generations                
              of fluid inclusions, and (3) to model reaction pathways for rocks              
              in both the immiscible and supercritical fluid regimes. Samples                
              to be studied are from coherent high-pressure terranes on the Ile              
              de Groix, in the Tauern Window, and on the island of Sifnos.  The              
              results should provide better constraints on the compositions of               
              fluids present at high pressure and result in better models for                
              devolatilization of subducting slabs.
