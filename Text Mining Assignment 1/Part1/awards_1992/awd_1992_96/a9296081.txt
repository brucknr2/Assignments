Abstract    :
                   Accurate modelling of the global distribution of trace gases              
              in the atmosphere is necessary to understand the sources and                   
              sinks (chemical , physical or biological) that control the global              
              budgets of the radiatively and chemically important gases.  This               
              effort continues the basic studies in theoretical modeling of the              
              global composition of the atmosphere.  First an investigation of               
              how to improve the manner in which the physical / chemical                     
              process in global 3-D models (e.g., chemistry, transport and                   
              diffusion) are coupled with the high-order numerical methods used              
              in calculating the transport of tracers, will be undertaken.                   
              Second, the developments of current research on three-dimensional              
              chemical transport models (CTM) for stratospheric ozone will be                
              used to examine how stratosphere-troposphere exchange controls                 
              the abundances of O3 and NOy in the upper troposphere.
