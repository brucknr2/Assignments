Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Existing theories of voting in the United States emphasize the role            
              of parties and issues in voter choice.  Recent research suggests               
              however, that evaluations of candidates may be more important than             
              issues or party loyalties.  The Research Planning Award supports               
              preliminary research to investigate the psychological processes by             
              which voters form images of political candidates.                              
                                                                                             
              Drawing upon recent research in cognitive psychology the research              
              will attempt to develop a research strategy to investigate the                 
              information encoding and retrieval processes by which voters                   
              acquire and process information about candidates.  Such information            
              has important implications for recent debates about the uses and               
              limitations of political debates, television advertising, the                  
              incumbency advantage, and negative campaigning.
