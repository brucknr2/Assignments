Abstract    :
                   Detailed experimental studies of the characteristic friction              
              distance Dc are needed to understand frictional instability and the            
              mechanisms of failure during earthquakes.  For bare rock surface               
              Dc is thought to represent the displacement necessary to change                
              completely the population of surface contacts; an interpretation               
              supported by data showing that Dc scales with surface roughness.               
              In fault gouge it does not necessarily follow that contact size,               
              and thus Dc, will scale with surface roughness, since particle-                
              surface contacts will be controlled by particle size as well as                
              surface roughness.  The motivation for the experiments is the                  
              observation that surface roughness does affect Dc of gouge, even               
              after shear has localized.  Since this means that the surface                  
              roughness effect on Dc cannot be explained solely as a consequence             
              of contact size it raises the question of what controls Dc for                 
              sliding within gouge.  This project involves a systematic study of             
              the effect of surface roughness on Dc of gouge.  The work will have            
              two specific objectives: 1) to expand the database for the surface             
              roughness effect on Dc to roughnesses 10-100 times that of existing            
              data, and 2) to investigate the micromechanics of Dc in gouge via              
              detailed mechanical and microstructural measurements.
