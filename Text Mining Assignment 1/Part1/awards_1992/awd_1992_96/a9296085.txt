Abstract    :
              This research is concerned with unresolved fundamental problems                
              associated with the charge-density-wave (CDW) transition, namely               
              the nature and effects of fluctuations in the neighborhood of the              
              CDW transition and secondly the nature of the very weak impurity               
              interactions with the CDW.  The role of phonon entropy on the                  
              thermodynamics of the CDW transition will be studied.   Improved               
              specific heat, elastic, and magnetization measurements will permit             
              a more careful confirmation of scaling laws.  A novel resonant                 
              ultrasonic method will be used for simultaneous evaluation of all              
              components of the elastic modulus tensor as a function of                      
              temperature.  Presently, thermodynamic measurements do not yet                 
              confirm the criticality temperature range shown by x-ray                       
              diffraction.  Susceptibility measurements will be attempted to                 
              further explore the validity of the scaling laws.  It is hoped to              
              provide experimental evidence on the influence of fluctuations on              
              charge and heat transport and to compare these results with                    
              thermodynamic quantities.  A second portion of the research is                 
              concerned with the synthesis of patassium molybdate with isotopic              
              substitution on the oxygen (0) site with the obtainment of well                
              controlled ratios of 180/160 or 170/160.  Both transport and nuclear           
              magnetic resonance measurements will be undertaken to obtain                   
              evidence on the pinning of the CDW.  A search for the effects of               
              the isotopic substitution on the CDW phase transition will be made.            
              This will be the first attempt to explore isotopic effects on CDW              
              systems.
