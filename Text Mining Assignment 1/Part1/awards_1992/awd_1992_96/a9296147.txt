Abstract    :
              This award will support a combined airborne radar and                          
              aeromagnetic survey of two 220 x 330 km regions between the                    
              Transantarctica Mountains and Marie Byrd Land during the 1990-91               
              and 1991-92 field seasons.  These efforts will address                         
              significant problems identified in the Ross Transect Zone (RTZ)                
              by the National Academy of Sciences (1986) report "Antarctic                   
              Solid Earth Sciences Research," and by the report to NSF "A Plan               
              for a United States Program to Study the Structure and Evolution               
              of the Antarctic Lithosphere (SEAL)."                                          
                                                                                             
              The surveys will be flown using the NSF/TUD radar and an                       
              areomagnetics system mounted in a light aircraft.  The grid                    
              spacing will be 5 km and navigation will be by radiopositioning.               
              In addition to maps of subglacial topography and magnetic                      
              intensity, attempts will be made to reconstruct the position of                
              subglacial diffractors in three dimensions.  This reconstruction               
              should give new information about the distribution of escarpments              
              and therefore the tectonic relationships within the region,                    
              especially when combined with the magnetic results.  These                     
              experiments will be conducted by the Byrd Polar Research Center                
              of the Ohio State University and the Water Resources and                       
              Geological Divisions of the U.S. Geological Survey.
