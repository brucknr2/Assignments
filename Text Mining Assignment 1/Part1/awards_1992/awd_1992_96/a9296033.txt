Abstract    :
                   The PI has studied viscous behavior at elevated temperature               
              in 1-2 micron glass-ceramic magnetite.  The goal of these                      
              experiments has been to identify the physical mechanism that                   
              causes VRM unblocking temperatures to be substantially higher                  
              than what traditional theories predict.  She will now extend the               
              previous studies of high-temperature viscosity, with the                       
              following goals: (1) to determine whether there is a causal link               
              between diffusion after-effect and anomalously high unblocking                 
              temperatures, by combining viscosity studies with measurements of              
              susceptibility as a function of time at elevated temperatures,                 
              and (2) to characterize viscous behavior and domain structure as               
              functions of temperature and initial thermal/magnetic state.
