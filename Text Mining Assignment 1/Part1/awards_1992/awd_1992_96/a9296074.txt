Abstract    :
              The research is to pursue a theory of robust control for                       
              nonlinear systems.  The development of robust control                          
              techniques for nonlinear systems would provide                                 
              valuable tools for nonlinear control analysis and design.                      
              The proposed lines of research are (1) the development                         
              of gain-scheduling into a systematic design methodology                        
              and (2) an investigation of input/output properties of                         
              nonlinear control design methods.  The research on                             
              gain-scheduling involves a theory for "Linear                                  
              Parameter-Varying" (LPV) systems.  LPV systems form                            
              the underlying framework for nonlinear gain-scheduled                          
              control.  A theory for such systems would remove                               
              gain-scheduling's fundamental limitation to systems                            
              which evolve slowly.  The research on input/output                             
              properties of nonlinear control design methods                                 
              represents an attempt to bring important linear robust                         
              control concepts to nonlinear systems.  Nonlinear                              
              control design methods typically rely on state-space                           
              representations.  An input/output analysis would lead                          
              to a better understanding of the capabilities and                              
              limitations of these design methods.
