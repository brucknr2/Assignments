Abstract    :
              This research investigates the metabolic interplay between an                  
              invertebrate host and its symbiotic, sulfur-oxidizing bacteria                 
              by studying (1) the role of sulfur compounds in maintaining the                
              functional symbiosis, (2) the internal defense mechanisms used                 
              for detoxifying sulfide, and (3) the role of sulfur compounds                  
              in supporting ATP synthesis, carbon fixation, and cellular                     
              metabolic rate.  The bivalve host Lucinia floridana harbors                    
              high densities of chemoautotrophic bacteria in its gill                        
              tissues, and furthermore, the bacteria are invariably housed in                
              one specific typed of eucaryotic cell, the bacteriocyte.  The                  
              use of isolated bacteriocytes figures prominently in the                       
              experimental approach, because this cell type represents the                   
              simplest level of organization at which the symbiosis is                       
              defined.  Studies of sulfide detoxification will be conducted                  
              at three levels of biological organization: tissue, isolated                   
              cells, and isolated organelles.  This multi-level approach                     
              should allow accurate resolution of the functional                             
              contributions to chemical defense of all individual components                 
              and then to integrated these separate mechanisms into a unified                
              model for sulfide detoxification in this organism.
