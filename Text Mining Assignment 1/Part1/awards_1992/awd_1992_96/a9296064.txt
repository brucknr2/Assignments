Abstract    :
              The research will examine the coupled thermomechanical behavior                
              of fluid-infiltrated geologic continua with particular emphasis                
              on nonlinear phenomena.  This investigation will be an                         
              extension of previous work on mall deformation hygrothermal                    
              response evaluation of geological media.  The governing field                  
              equations and finite element formulations will be developed                    
              within a framework consistent with continuum thermodynamics                    
              mixture theory.  One-dimensional and axisymmetric boundary value               
              problems will be initially analyzed for interpretation of coupled              
              mechanisms, model calibration, and assumption refinement.                      
              Particular attention will be devoted to the characterization                   
              of critically stressed zones using recently developed strain                   
              or stress based continuum damage models. Subsequently, advanced                
              two-dimensional problems with applications in nuclear waste                    
              isolation and hydraulic fracturing will be investigated.
