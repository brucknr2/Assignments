Abstract    :
              The objectives of this research are to overlay lightning ground                
              flash locations on two radar reflectivity patterns in Doppler                  
              derived motions.  This will provide a way to study the lightning               
              characteristics and locations with respect to high reflectivity                
              patterns and vorticity centers in mesocyclones.  One hypothesis                
              of charged separation in thunderstorms will be examined by                     
              determining if the lightning locations cluster near high gradient              
              dBz values, a region known to have high velocity updrafts and                  
              downdrafts.  In addition, an objective of this research is to                  
              examine the 1989 lightning/data for the contiguous United States.              
              This study will examine the variation of the peak current,                     
              polarity, and lightning flash densities as a function of                       
              geographical position and season.
