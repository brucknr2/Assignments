Abstract    :
                   This three-year research project seeks to extend and broaden              
              a program that is dealing with the growing season (May-August)                 
              rainfall of the region bounded by the Rocky and Appalachian                    
              mountains, the Gulf Coast, and approximately 55 N in Canada.  The              
              fundamental goals to date have been to:  (i) identify the                      
              characteristic spatial patterns of rainfall variation for 1949-                
              80; and (ii) quantify the "local" climate system                               
              processes/conditions (those occurring over and adjacent to study               
              region -- water vapor occurrence and supply, troposphere's                     
              predisposition to provide uplift) contributing to the contrasting              
              rainfall patterns of three case study years (1975, 1976, 1979).                
              The PIs will (a) extend and complement the aforementioned                      
              rainfall analyses; (b) complete and integrate the above "local"                
              case study investigations; and (c) initiate inquiry into the                   
              wider climate system causes of the region's growing season                     
              rainfall variations.                                                           
                   This research is important because it seeks to understand                 
              regional climate variability in the context of more global                     
              climate features and forcing.
