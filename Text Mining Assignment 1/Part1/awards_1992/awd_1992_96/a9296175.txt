Abstract    :
              The goal of this research proposed is to develop parallel sparse               
              system solvers for symmetric indefinite and non-symmetric linear               
              systems such as those occurring in computational fluid dynamics,               
              develop parallel techniques for solving time-dependent problems, and           
              construct a rapid prototyping environment for developing and                   
              experimenting with algorithms in sparse matrix computations on shared          
              and distributed memory multiprocessors.  In particular, the following          
              will be examined:                                                              
                                                                                             
                o  parallel solution schemes for solving Stokes-like linear problems         
                   arising in CFD and other augmented Lagrangian problems such as            
                   interior point methods of linear programming,                             
                                                                                             
                o  incomplete Newton methods with Krylov or row projection iterative         
                   solvers for the inner iteration,                                          
                                                                                             
                o  solution of time-dependent problems using high-order parallel             
                   methods in time,                                                          
                                                                                             
                o  defining and developing sparse matrix primitives analogous to the         
                   highly effective BLAS-3's for dense computations, and                     
                                                                                             
                o  implementing sparse factorization and solution schemes.                   
                                                                                             
              The goal is portable efficiency and scalability, by exploiting                 
              parallelism on multiple levels.  This in turn will allow the work to           
              be used across a wide spectrum of existing and future computer                 
              architectures, instead of simply a particular machine.
