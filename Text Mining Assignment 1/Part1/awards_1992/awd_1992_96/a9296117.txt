Abstract    :
                   This research is in the area of nonlinear analysis and                    
              partial differential equations that arise in applications to                   
              deterministic and stochastic control, differential games,                      
              mechanics and physics.  Specific topics of interest include the                
              following:  Partial differential equations of Hamilton-Jacobi-                 
              Bellman type; existence of value for stochastic differential                   
              games; pattern formation in reaction-diffusion systems; generic                
              regularity of solutions to porous medium equations; stability of               
              solitary wave solutions to Korteweg-de-Vries equations; and                    
              analytical studies of nonlinear Schrodinger equations.
