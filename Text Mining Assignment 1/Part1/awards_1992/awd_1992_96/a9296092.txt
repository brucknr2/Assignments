Abstract    :
              There has never been a concurrent study of prey capture success                
              and water flow over reef corals.  This project will investigate                
              the effect of water movement on several aspects of the feeding                 
              biology of corals.  The first portion of the project will measure              
              field rates of feeding of three species of coral, Montastrea                   
              annularis, Eusmilia fastigiata and Porites porites with prey                   
              sampling by an automated pump/sampler array that allows                        
              concurrent measurement of water flow (thermistor flowmeter,                    
              video), irradiance (Licor quantum irradiance meter) and prey                   
              availability (DO pump sampler).  Feeding experiments on expansion              
              and contraction behavior and feeding during several diel cycles.               
              A self-contained underwater thermistor flowmeter with a 2 mm                   
              spatial resolution has been constructed and tested for this                    
              research based on the design of LaBarbera and Vogel (1976).  The               
              data collected will be used to characterize the general flow                   
              regime at the site (mainstream flow at several points along depth              
              transects using the Interocean S4 recording current meter),                    
              providing new information about the flow environment on coral                  
              reefs in St. Croix at the NOAA National Undersea Research                      
              Program's AQUARIUS habitat.
