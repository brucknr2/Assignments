Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This project will use the DSRV ALVIN to directly study                         
              the dynamics of turbulent buoyant plumes emanating from                        
              active hydrothermal vents. The aim of the project is to provide                
              a sound basis for relating water-comumn measurements of                        
              the effluent plumes to the thermal output of the underlying                    
              oceanic crust. The PI's propose to mount an instrument package on              
              ALVIN that will measure temperature, conductivity                              
              (salinity), vertical and horizontal velocity, light attenuation                
              (particledensity), and concentrations of manganese, silica, and                
              sulfide in real time via in situ flow injection analysis.                      
              The instrument will also collect discrete water samples                        
              for laboratory analyses. Data and water samples will be                        
              collected in real time shile driving ALVIN through buoyant                     
              hydrothermal plumes at several heights in the water column.                    
              Undiluted hydrothermal source fluids and the surrounding water                 
              column will also be studied. Specific objectives incluse:                      
              (1) characterization of vertical and lateral variation in                      
              physical properties, velocities, chemical concentrations, and                  
              suspended particles within the buoyant plume, (2) quantification               
              of entrainment and dilution rates as function of plume height,                 
              (3) determine turbulent variability in the buoyant plume and                   
              relate to property variations, and (5) testing numerical plume                 
              models against field measurements.
