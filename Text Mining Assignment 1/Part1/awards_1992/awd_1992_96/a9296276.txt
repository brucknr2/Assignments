Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This a two year program which will develop 12 summer                           
              industrial fellowship programs for high school teachers.                       
              Sponsored by the Triangle Coalition for Science and                            
              Technology Education it is based upon a similar successful                     
              program operated by the Industry Initiatives for Science and                   
              Math Education (IISME) in the San Francisco Bay area.  A                       
              similar program was started in the Detroit area as a pilot                     
              project and has proven to be successful.  The intent of this                   
              proposal is to disseminate the program on a national scale.                    
              The funding will support workshops at 12 proposed sites                        
              throughout the country, 8 of which are at NASA facilities.                     
              Consultants from IISME will help to plan the local fellowship                  
              program and will train educational coordinators for each site                  
              so that the fellowship experience can be translated into                       
              classroom contributions.  The result will be that 240 science                  
              teachers will be placed as industrial interns and will have                    
              direct hands-on experience with science based technology. The                  
              interns upon returning to the classroom will have up-to-date                   
              information to teach students in the schools.  The NSF share                   
              of this project is $159,490.  It will be matched by                            
              contributions from the industries where the interns will be                    
              placed.  This match                                                            
              will amount to $329,100, more than double the funds provided by                
              NSF.
