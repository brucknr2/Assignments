Abstract    :
              The research addresses the effects of fluorine on alkali                       
              diffusion in alkali feldspar.  It is expected that fluorine will               
              substitute readily for oxygen in the feldspar structure                        
              disrupting the silicate framework and introducing vacancies in                 
              the cation istes, and will thereby increase the rate of alkali                 
              diffusion. Alkali diffusion will be studied over a temperature                 
              range of about 500-1000oC and pressures from 1 bar to 15                       
              kilobars.  Early experiments will be anhydrous, but water will be              
              added later to check the combined effects of the two volatiles.                
              Results will be analyzed by either electron microprobe or                      
              transmission electron microscopy, as appropriate, to determine                 
              the alkali diffusion rates.  The isolated effects of                           
              temperature, pressure, and fluorine fugacity will be measured.                 
              The results will be applied to determination of the time required              
              for specific geologic events to take place.
