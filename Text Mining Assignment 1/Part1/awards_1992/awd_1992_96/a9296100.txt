Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  High accumulation rates, the lack of bioturbation, an                     
              abundance of distinct laminae (probably varves), and the                       
              preservation of both siliceous and calcareous microfossils, make               
              the anoxic sediments of the Cariaco Basin optimal for use in                   
              constructing high-resolution records of paleoclimatic change.                  
              During the field program, piston, gravity, and box core samples                
              of these laminated sediments will be collected. AMS radiocarbon                
              time control and multiple paleoenvironmental proxies will be used              
              to focus on changes in trade wind strength and hydrologic balance              
              over the western tropical North Atlantic region during the last                
              glacial termination, the Holocene, and the Little Ice Age.                     
              Preliminary analysis of existing data suggests that this change                
              was large and related to global climatic change.                               
                                                                                             
              After testing the annual nature of the sediment laminae,                       
              calibration time series of proxy data from the sediment directly               
              against observed hydrographic and climatic data will be made.                  
              Synoptic analysis and climate model experiments will be used to                
              understand reconstructed patterns of low latitude variability in               
              the context of global change and to test hypothesized causes of                
              this variability.
