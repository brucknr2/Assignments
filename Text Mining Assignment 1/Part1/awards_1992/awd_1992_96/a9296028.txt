Abstract    :
              This project is to use textural and chemical analyses of deep                  
              ocean pumice from the Okinawa Trough (provided by Dr. K.                       
              Nakamura) to 1) document the deep ocean origin of this material                
              by measuring volatile contents of the glasses, 2) quantify pumice              
              structures, and 3) use the combined data presented above to                    
              update current models of vesiculation and fragmentation in order               
              to constrain physical conditions of these submarine eruptions.                 
              Additionally, the PI proposes to continue collaborative work with              
              R.S. Fiske on a combined theoretical, experimental and field-                  
              based investigation of partitioning of tephra.
