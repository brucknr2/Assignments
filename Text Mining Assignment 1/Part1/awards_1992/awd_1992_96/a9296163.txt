Abstract    :
              Evolutionary and population biology questions can now be                       
              approached on a molecular level.  How do the joint                             
              evolutionary forces of natural selection and genetic drift                     
              modulate the level and pattern of genetic variation within                     
              natural populations and between species?  That question will                   
              be asked on a molecular level with the technique of "four-                     
              cutter" analysis which allows identification of approximately                  
              25% of all nucleotide polymorphism in large samples from                       
              natural populations.  Also, new techniques will be developed                   
              to allow collection of more molecular data in shorter time                     
              periods.                                                                       
                                                                                             
              While providing insight into population biology and                            
              evolutionary phenomena, this study is also pioneering a new                    
              subdiscipline of molecular population genetics.
