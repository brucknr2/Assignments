Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This project will analyze and interpret previously collected                   
              samples of He-3 from the plume of He-3 emanating at hydrothermal               
              sources on the East Pacific Rise. These data along with other                  
              samples from the water column and direct measurements of current               
              will be used to determine the circulation at 2-3 km in the                     
              eastern Pacific Ocean between about 5 degrees and 20 degrees                   
              South latitude. The results will be compared to long-standing                  
              ideas about interior circulation in the deep oceans.
