Abstract    :
              Many regulatory genes of flies, mice, humans, and other metazoan               
              organisms share a specific sequence motif known as the homeobox.               
              A group of these genes share other characteristics as well,                    
              including their ordered arrangement in large gene complexes.  The              
              significance of these highly conserved patterns of organization is             
              unknown, but suggests that mechanisms for the genetic control of               
              development may be highly conserved, even while may involve                    
              processes not yet encountered in simple regulatory systems.  An                
              example of such a highly ordered gene complex is the bithorax                  
              complex, which plays a key role in the determination of segmental              
              identity during development of fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster.              
              The work described in this proposal contributes to the genetic and             
              molecular analysis of the bithorax complex, concentrating upon one             
              regulatory region:  the infra-abdominal-5,7 (iab-5,7) region of the            
              Abdominal-B domain.  This region, which is 60kb in size and located            
              3' of the gene it controls, is required for the proper development             
              of three specific segments of the fly.  Three major projects are               
              proposed: (1) Recovery of new mutations within the iab-5,7 region              
              using mutagenic agents which cause small deletions.  (2) Comparison            
              of the iab-5,7 region in D. melanogaster and a distant Drosophila              
              species, D. virilis, by sequence analysis and cross-species                    
              transformation experiments.  (3) Functional analysis of cis-                   
              regulatory elements within iab-5,7 using P-factor-mediated                     
              transformation.                                                                
                                                                                             
              How regulatory genes such as the bithorax region of Drosophila                 
              control the genetic determinants leading to body morphology is a               
              fundamental mystery and the results from this project should give              
              us a little more insight into the process.***//
