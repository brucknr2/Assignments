Abstract    :
                   The principal goal of this research planning project is to                
              prescribe a performance evaluation environment that supports the               
              effective, efficient, and creative programming of parallel computer            
              systems.  Since the complexity of parallel computer systems makes              
              program performance evaluation and prediction difficult, tools                 
              employing the experimental method to observe, analyze, and display             
              system activity are essential.  Accurate insights about program                
              execution, particularly on future large systems, are possible only if          
              innovative techniques are used in the areas of instrumentation, data           
              management, visualization, and knowledge engineering.  Within this             
              context, this project will study the relationships between properties          
              of parallel programs and properties of the performance representations         
              produced during execution on scalable multicomputer systems.  The              
              validity and utility of particular views and statistics as indicators          
              and predictors of program performance are to be investigated.
