Abstract    :
                This research is to construct a global-scale mantle and core                 
              structure which satisfies waveforms of P-SV type body waves as well            
              as SH type body waves.  Previous global body wave inversions were              
              attempted only for SH type waveform data.  The new methods are                 
              possible because of advances in computer speed and storage and                 
              improvements in theory.  Simultaneous inversion for both P-and S-              
              velocity provides possible clues as to the nature of seismic                   
              anomalies, that is, thermal versus compositional cause of                      
              anomalies.  This in turn will aid in our understanding of the                  
              dynamics and composition of the mantle and core.
