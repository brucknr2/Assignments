Abstract    :
                   Dr. Ronald Kettner will study two basic questions: 1) how                 
              dofrontal cortical areas control rapid arm movements to a                      
              sequenceof targets in space; and 2) how are these sequences                    
              stored inshort.term memory during a delay period before                        
              movementinitiation?  His basic approach will be to record from                 
              singleneurons in the frontal cortex of well.trained rhesus                     
              monkeysperforming a simple arm movement task.  The data he                     
              collectsalong with previously collected data will allow Dr.                    
              Kettner todevelop and test mathematical models of frontal                      
              corticalfunction.  This work is important because it will give us              
              abetter and more detailed understanding of how arm movements                   
              aregenerated from cortical initiation.
