Abstract    :
                   Yetter will explore several aspects of the recently                       
              discovered interactions between low-dimensional topology,                      
              statistical mechanics, quantum field theory, Hopf algebra and                  
              monoidal category theory.                                                      
                   In particular, he will use Hopf algebra and category                      
              theoretic techniques to construct and, if possible, classify 1)                
              solutions to the quantum Yang-Baxter equation and 2) topological               
              and conformal quantum field theories.  Even partial results would              
              shed light on the meaning and interrelations of the newly                      
              discovered polynomial invariants of classical knots and links.
