Abstract    :
                   We live in a three-dimensional world, and we are aware of                 
              it.  The perception of the visual space that surrounds us as                   
              three-dimensional is the product of complicated                                
              neurophysiological processes but the three-dimensionality of                   
              movements and forces generated by the arm is given, due to the                 
              multi-articulated construction of the skeleton and the multiple                
              muscles attached to it.  The question is then, how well does the               
              3-D visual map correspond to the 3-D motor map?  How well can we               
              match directions defined in 3-D visual space with directions of                
              movements and forces operating in the same space?  How well can                
              we control our force vectors in 3-D space and in time, e.g. when               
              we track a moving target?  How successfully can we intercept that              
              moving target?  These and other questions are being studied                    
              quantitatively by Dr. Apostolos Georgopoulos and his team of                   
              scientists.  Studies will be carried out using human arm                       
              movements.  The visual instruction for the generation of 3-D                   
              force vectors will be presented in the form of a vivid                         
              stereoscopic image, and the 3-D force output of the arm will be                
              monitored using a 3-D isometric manipulandum.  The results will                
              be analyzed using statistical techniques for 3-D data and an                   
              information-theoretical analysis.
