Abstract    :
                   The combinatorial description of Witten's invariant of 3-                 
              manifolds and links which the investigator developed in his last               
              two papers will be explored in a number of directions.  The                    
              combinatorial technique will be extended to include knotted                    
              graphs.  A reformulation of the invariant of trivalent graphs in               
              terms of tetrahedral decompositions will be developed.  The                    
              implications of this for invariants of the manifolds themselves                
              will be explored, and a relationship sought with the parallel                  
              work of Viro and Turaev.  A geometric interpretation of this                   
              tetrahedral formula will also be attempted, in close analogy with              
              Regge and Ponzano's interpretation of spin networks.  Connections              
              will also be explored with invariants in other dimensions: the                 
              Donaldson invariants in four dimensions and surgery invariants                 
              for dimensions five and above.                                                 
                   In short, the investigator will explore topological                       
              invariants inspired by quantum physics.  He will examine their                 
              usefulness in purely topological settings.  He will also explore               
              the physical implications of the resulting topology.
