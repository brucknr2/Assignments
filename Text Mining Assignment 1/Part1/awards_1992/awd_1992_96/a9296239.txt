Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This research will investigate the question of whether it is                   
              better to pay attention to potentially unpleasant physical                     
              sensations or to try to distract from them.  Two basic questions               
              will be investigated:  (1) what are the possible costs of                      
              avoidant strategies?  and (2) what are the benefits of monitoring              
              strategies?  This study has both theoretical and practical                     
              importance.  Research on somatic interpretation has implications               
              for both basic psychological processes such as attention,                      
              selfregulation and bio-psychological interactions, and for                     
              clinical problems of medical care-seeking, compliance, and                     
              rehabilitation.
