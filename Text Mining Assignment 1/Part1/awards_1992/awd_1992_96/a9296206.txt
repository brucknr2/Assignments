Abstract    :
                   A major limitation to our progress in understanding of                    
              larval dispersal and recruitment processes in marine systems is                
              our inability to track the movements and fate of larvae in the                 
              ocean.  Dr. Levin will investigate the development of techniques               
              for use of rare earth elements to label invertebrate larvae and                
              inanimate (passive) particles in the field.  Rare earth elements               
              make excellent tracers because they occur at extremely low                     
              background levels in nature and are inert when introduced into                 
              the field, but become highly radioactive and are detectable at                 
              nano-to picogram levels when subjected to neutron activation.                  
              Advantages of this tracer over others are the short time and                   
              minimal manpower required for label detection in plankton or                   
              tissue samples, and the high degree of sensitivity and accuracy                
              associated with neutron activation analysis.   The research will               
              develop incorporation techniques for bivalve, crustacean and                   
              polychaete larvae, assess label persistence and behavioral                     
              effects, and incorporate rare earths into passive particles with               
              fall velocities comparable to the larvae of interest.
