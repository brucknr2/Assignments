Abstract    :
                   Theoretical research at the interface between                             
              astrophysics and elementary particle physics will include                      
              studies of inflationary cosmology (in which the universe                       
              undergoes a period of very rapid expansion), the binding of                    
              free quarks into nucleons in the early universe, and the                       
              nature of walls between different domains in the universe.                     
              All of these topics are important elements of our emerging                     
              picture of how the universe evolved to its present state.
