Abstract    :
              Issues concerning individual                                                   
              buildings and facilities have been                                             
              one of the primary focuses of                                                  
              design professionals and decision                                              
              makers dealing with earthquake                                                 
              hazard mitigation.  A prevailing                                               
              view has been that when seismic                                                
              building provisions are taken into                                             
              consideration, the effects of an                                               
              earthquake on the urban fabric                                                 
              would be similar to the aggregate                                              
              effects on individual buildings in                                             
              the total urban environment.                                                   
              However, buildings are not located

              buildings, infrastructure systems,                                             
              and physical urban patterns are                                                
              strongly interrelated.  The complex

              This project will develop a set of
