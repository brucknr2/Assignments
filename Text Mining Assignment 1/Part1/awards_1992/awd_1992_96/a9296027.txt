Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              It is commonly accepted that shallow crystallization and                       
              degassing of silicic magmas contribute to the potential                        
              explosivity of a volcanic eruption, but the rates at which such                
              processes operate in natural systems are unknown.  The recent                  
              eruption of Mount St. Helens involved both explosive and non-                  
              explosive (dome-building) episodes that have followed a pattern                
              of decreasing intensity and decreasing time-averaged magma                     
              production rates from 1980 through 1986;  this trend has been                  
              interpreted to be the result of progressive of a single batch of               
              dacite magma (e.g. Scandone and Malone, 1985).  This project is                
              for a detailed textural and chemical study of the products of the              
              1980 explosive eruptions of Mount St. Helens volcano with the                  
              goal of 1) using changes in glass chemistry and groundmass                     
              crystallinity together with stratigraphic work on deposits of May              
              18, 1980 (provided  by Criswell, 1987) to assemble a pre-eruption              
              stratigraphy of the Mount St. Helens magmatic system. 2)                       
              quantifying observed groundmass changes through the summer of                  
              1980 to determine rates of crystallization in response to system               
              degassing and depressurization, and 3) relating measured                       
              crystallinity and bulk chemistry to physical changes in eruptive               
              style of the volcano; in particular, relating these parameters to              
              observed patterns of degassing and changes in eruption rate and                
              intensity.  Proposed methods of study including not only                       
              detailed microprobe, BASEM and TEM analysis, but also                          
              quantification of textural parameters (e.g. the size and shape                 
              distributions of crystals and vesicles) made possible by recent                
              advances in automated image analysis capabilities.  This study                 
              differs from other approached to the "petrologic" inverse                      
              problem" not only in the extreme sample control based on timing,               
              seismicity, and eruption style, but also in the application of                 
              textural as well as chemical criteria for sample classification.
