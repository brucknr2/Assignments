Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This is a Presidential Young Investigator Award to Dr. Patricia                
              Kane, Department of Chemistry, College of William and Mary.  Dr.               
              Kane's research interest is intracellular protein transport and                
              organelle biogenesis, specifically in the assembly, targeting, and             
              function of multisubunit proteins.  Her current research focus is              
              the vacuolar proton-transporting ATPase of yeast.  Dr. Kane's                  
              commitment to training the next generation of young scientists is              
              clear since she has chosen to pursue her career in the setting of              
              an undergraduate institution.
