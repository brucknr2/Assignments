Abstract    :
              Image frames are generated by scanning a scene several times a second.         
              Frame-to-frame motion estimation in the moving part(s) of the scene are        
              of interest.  The objective of this work is to develop and implement a         
              new iterative and computationally efficient algorithm for estimating           
              non-uniform frame-to-frame motion from noisy data.  The algorithm is           
              based on the generalized maximum likelihood criterion and referred to          
              as the GML algorithm.  The algorithm is implemented using 2D fast-             
              Fourier transform techniques using Markovian random field models to            
              represent the motion vectors.  Performance and sensitivity analysis are        
              made to test the suitability of the algorithm for real world                   
              applications.
