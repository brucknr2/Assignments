Abstract    :
              The principal investigator will serve as President of the Inter-               
              Union Commission on the Lithosphere, a major component of the                  
              International Council of Scientific Unions (ICSU).  The President              
              will chair meetings of the Commission and oversee the                          
              Commission's intersessional activities.  The Commission's work is              
              directed towards development of an international                               
              interdisciplinary program of research on the origin, evolution,                
              and dynamics of the earth's lithosphere, especially continental                
              margins.  The President will also direct the operations of the                 
              Commission's Secretariat, assuring that documentation is prepared              
              for meetings, that reports summarizing these meetings and other                
              commission activities are prepared and distributed, and that the               
              Commission's work is coordinated with those of other related ICSU              
              commissions and unions.  The President will also represent the                 
              Commission in interactions with these other ICSU bodies.
