Abstract    :
              This research is on developing models for evaluating hierarchal                
              testability of circuits.  Three topics are being pursued.  First,              
              stochastic models for circuit structure, used for obtaining                    
              analytical expressions of controllability and observability, are               
              being explored.  New testability metrics and fast testability                  
              evaluation of IC's based on the stochastic models are being                    
              investigated.  Second, a unified framework for expressing                      
              hierarchal testability metrics is being established.  This allows              
              representation of any testability metric for the purpose of                    
              hierarchal testability analysis.  Formal methods of composing                  
              testability metrics are being developed.  Third, efficient                     
              algorithms for doing the partitioning for testability are being                
              designed and evaluated.  Central to the approach is the development            
              of a discrete hazard function that quantifies for each level in a              
              circuit the difficulty to fault propagation exhibited by the                   
              circuit structure.
