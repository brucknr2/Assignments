Abstract    :
              Multi-rate control systems (digital control                                    
              systems with more than one sample or hold                                      
              rate) appear often.  Their practical importance                                
              as well as their complexity mandate the use of                                 
              computers in the design process. We have                                       
              developed a lifting isomorphism theory for                                     
              multi-rate systems. We have shown that it is                                   
              comprehensive in application and perfectly                                     
              suited to computer aided control design by                                     
              convex optimization (Q'-Design').  The                                         
              objective of research is to continue research                                  
              toward a complete robustness theory and Q-                                     
              Design methodology that will supplement and                                    
              eventually replace many currently used                                         
              heuristic multi-rate design techniques.
