Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The goal of this research is to study crystal structures,                      
              electronic structures, and bonding changes in metallic systems at              
              extreme conditions of pressures and temperatures.  Calibrated                  
              pressures of over 4 million atmospheres have been achieved in                  
              diamond anvil cell devices.  This capability is combined with laser            
              heating techniques at synchrotron research facilities to examine               
              phase structure under extreme static conditions.  The research                 
              includes prototype metallic alloys from the transition metals,                 
              including molybdenum-ruthenium, tungsten-rhenium, and titanium-                
              aluminum to examine phase stability under imposed high pressures               
              and temperatures.  Other metals of interest include thorium,                   
              praseodymium, and neodymium.  These studies should improve                     
              fundamental understanding of high pressure, high temperature, and              
              compositional effects on phase stability and structure in metallic             
              systems.
