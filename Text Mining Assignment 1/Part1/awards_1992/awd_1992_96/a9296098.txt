Abstract    :
                   This research will study the asymptotic solution of nonline-              
              ar initial and boundary value problems involving systems of                    
              differential equations.  A characteristic of the solutions of                  
              these equations is that they exhibit rapid changes within thin                 
              regions.  Consequently, the asymptotic methods are able to make                
              use of the presence of multiple scales.  Of particular interest                
              in this research are problems involving boundary and interior                  
              layers.  The work is motivated by physical applications including              
              models which simulate the operation of semiconductor devices and               
              problems arising from optimal control.  Problems will be attacked              
              using a combined analytical and numerical approach.
