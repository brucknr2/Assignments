Abstract    :
              This project is in the general area of analytical and surface                  
              chemistry and in the subfield of electroanalytical chemistry.                  
              The primary thrust of this activity is develop normal and reverse              
              pulse squarewave voltammetric techniques for application to                    
              micro- and ultramicroelectrodes.  These electrodes, which have                 
              diameters less than 25 micrometers, are fabricated from platinum,              
              carbon, tungsten, and mercury-coated iridium.  Use of them as                  
              voltammetric sensors alleviates many of the electrical resistance              
              restrictions that are encountered with larger electrodes.  The                 
              theory which describes the pulse voltammetric responses expected               
              at these electrodes is being developed by Dr. Osteryoung for                   
              analytical and kinetic use.                                                    
                                                                                             
              The application of pulse voltammetric techniques to micro- and                 
              ultramicroelectrodes provides new, sensitive electrochemical                   
              measurement technologies that should have broad application in                 
              trace analysis, materials characterization, and in vivo studies of             
              biosystems.
