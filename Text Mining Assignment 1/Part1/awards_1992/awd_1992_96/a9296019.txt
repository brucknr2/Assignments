Abstract    :
              This is an award to provide support for research to be                         
              initiated by this Presidential Young Investigator who was                      
              nominated under conditions contained in the Program                            
              Announcement NSF 89-58. The goal of this investigator's                        
              research is to increase her understanding of biological                        
              treatment processes used in treatment of wastewater as                         
              components of ecosystems.  This approach will be used by                       
              her to study the interactions of chemical, physical and                        
              biological processes including interactions of involved                        
              microorganisms with each other and with the environment.                       
              Examples include extending her work on the role of pH                          
              variations in algal biofilms to nitrification,                                 
              denitrification and methanogenesis in wastewater treatment                     
              processes.                                                                     
                                                                                             
              Results of this research are likely to be utilized in                          
              engineering design of processes and systems for removal of                     
              contaminants from wastewater.  The results may be useful                       
              in determining how nitrogen can be removed from wastewater                     
              by use of a single biofilm that includes both aerobic and                      
              anaerobic processes within it.
