Abstract    :
                   Joints are ubiquitous features in rocks.  This study will                 
              examine directions of vertical propagation of joints in the                    
              Colorado Plateau to test various hypotheses of the origin of                   
              joints.  Results will be of theoretical utility as well as of                  
              help in understanding causes of fluid flow in joints.
