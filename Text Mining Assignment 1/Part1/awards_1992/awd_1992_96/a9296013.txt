Abstract    :
              This project is in the general area of analytical and surface                  
              chemistry and in the subfield of mass transport through ion                    
              exchange polymer films.  Different microstructures of ion                      
              exchange polymers, which exhibit local short range order (5 to                 
              100 nanometers), will be induced through thermal processing as                 
              well as by sorption in microstructured substrates such as                      
              polycarbonate membranes and latex spheres.  The microstructure                 
              of the polymer layer will be evaluated by infrared and X-ray                   
              spectroscopies and its transport-selectivity determined by                     
              electrochemical methods.  Mathematical models will be developed                
              for the relationships between these properties.                                
                                                                                             
              Mass transport through ion exchange membranes and its                          
              enhancement through electrostatic effects is an important field                
              both scientifically and technologically, with implications for                 
              biological systems.  Development of generalized relationships                  
              describing their transport characteristics will facilitate                     
              optimization of separators for specific applications, design of                
              catalysts with active sites situated in microstructured                        
              matrices that control the transport of selected species, and                   
              fabrication of modified electrodes for electrochemical                         
              catalysis and analysis.
