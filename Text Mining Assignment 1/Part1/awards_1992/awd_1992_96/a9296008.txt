Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The project examines the hydrodynamics and transport                           
              properties of a liquid-liquid contacting device for the study                  
              of phase transfer catalysis (PTC) and related reactive-                        
              transport systems.  Research on solid-liquid PTC is now                        
              continuing with liquid-liquid PTC.  Mass transfer is studied                   
              between aqueous streams and between aqueous and organic phases                 
              with the use of an electrochemical tracer technique.  The                      
              vertical distribution of radial velocities is investigated                     
              with a recently acquired laser-Doppler velocimeter.  The role                  
              of hydrodynamic instabilities in the laminar-flow contacting                   
              device is examined.  The results are useful in various                         
              industrial organic syntheses for the production of polymers,                   
              pesticides, and pharmaceutical.
