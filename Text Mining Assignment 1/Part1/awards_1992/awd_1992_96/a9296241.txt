Abstract    :
              This is an award to support research by this Presidential                      
              Young Investigator (PYI) on physical and chemical                              
              mechanisms that affect migration of synthetic organic                          
              chemicals in groundwater and the fate of these                                 
              contaminants when the water is extracted from subsurface                       
              aquifers and subjected to water treatment processes.  This                     
              project involves investigation of the extent and rate of                       
              organic contaminant uptake by natural solids found in                          
              soils and determination of the controlling mechanisms.                         
                                                                                             
              This is the initial, base-level award for this PYI.                            
              Results of this research are likely to be applied in                           
              engineering design of processes and systems for                                
              decontamination of soil contaminated by organic chemicals                      
              from accidental spills or by substances leaching from                          
              disposal sites for hazardous wastes.  The results may also                     
              be applied in engineering design of treatment processes                        
              for removal of organic contaminants from water.
