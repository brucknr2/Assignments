Abstract    :
              This award from the Academic Research Infrastructure Program                   
              will help the Department of Chemistry at the University of                     
              Southern California purchase laser equipment.  This equipment                  
              will be used in the following research activities:                             
                                                                                             
              1.  Molecular Species That are Absorbed on Surfaces.                           
                                                                                             
              2.  The Phenomenon of Optical Activity.                                        
                                                                                             
              3.  The Active Sites of Metalloproteins Containing Transition                  
                  Metals.                                                                    
                                                                                             
              4.  Studies of Photodissociation Reaction Dynamics in Small                    
                  Polyatomic Molecules.                                                      
                                                                                             
              5.  Photoinitiated Reactions in Weakly Bonded Complexes.

              Lasers emit a narrow beam of coherent, powerful and nearly                     
              monochromatic electromagnetic radiation.  This radiation is                    
              used in Chemistry to study a broad range of subjects, from the                 
              dynamics of proteins and nucleic acids to photoelectron                        
              transfer processes, and from interfacial chemistry to                          
              picosecond pulse shaping.
