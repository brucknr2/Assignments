Abstract    :
                   This project will provide new instrumentation for the growth,             
              processing and characterization of lowdimensional artificial                   
              structures for teaching and research on the campus of University of            
              California-Berkeley. The new equipment will be linked to an                    
              existing molecular beam epitaxy chamber, and represents new                    
              infrastructure in the field of nanostructured materials, which is              
              important for microfabrication.                                                
                   The equipment will be housed in the Microfabrication                      
              laboratory, and includes one ultra-high vaccum (UHV) chamber for               
              deposition of metals, one UHV chamber for focused ion beam writing             
              and low energy electron irradiation, one UHV chamber for                       
              photo-luminesence and scanning tunneling microscopy (STM). These               
              three chambers will be linked (UHV) to an existing molecular beam              
              epitaxy (MBE) system. This facility will provde capability for                 
              conventional fabrication of quantumconfined nanostructures, novel              
              processing methods such as STM lithography, engineered sitespecific            
              phase nucleation, and in-situ surface modification, which will be              
              available to campus faculty, students, and interested industries.              
                   Three departments and two Colleges of the university will                 
              undertake research in nanoscale physics, nanostructured                        
              optoelectronic devices, processing of nanoscale materials, and                 
              diagnostics of nanostructural degradation mechanisms.
