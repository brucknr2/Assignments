Abstract    :
                   The Department of Biochemistry and Cell                                   
              Biology at SUNY Stony Brook will renovate five                                 
              laboratories into modules for graduate,                                        
              undergraduate and postdoctoral research and                                    
              research training.  The renovated laboratories                                 
              will bring together four recently appointed                                    
              faculty members from Biochemistry and Cell Biology                             
              who share common research interests.  The                                      
              renovation plan permits these junior faculty to                                
              all be moved in proximity of each other and to                                 
              provide room for growth of their research programs                             
              and room for collaborative projects.  A common                                 
              theme of research of these cell biologists is                                  
              macromeolecular transport through the cell.  To                                
              further encourage interactions among these faculty                             
              and their students, all of their laboratories will                             
              open to a common central corridor with shared                                  
              facilities.                                                                    
                   The renovated laboratories will also adjoin                               
              two recently renovated laboratories belonging to                               
              faculty members in the Department of Neurobiology                              
              and Behavior.  The proximity of these researchers                              
              will also act as a catalyst for the production of                              
              a mutually nurturing and creative environment                                  
              between two departments in the Division of                                     
              Biology.
