Abstract    :
              A joint research project between the University of Missouri-Rolla              
              and the Dalian University of Technology in China is proposed to                
              study optimum design of three-dimensional flexible and stiff                   
              structures with multiple constraints and objective functions.  The             
              constraints include stability, lateral-torsional motion, design                
              code provisions of allowable displacements, stresses, and P-                   
              effects for various loading conditions.  Research efforts are                  
              concentrated on 1) structural modeling of reinforced concrete and              
              steel building systems, 2) development of optimization algorithms              
              for large structures built of different construction materials, 3)             
              formulation of objective functions including construction and                  
              damage costs, 4) serviceability and reliability studies of optimum             
              design parameters of various structures, 5) experimental                       
              verification of the damage model for a selected structural system,             
              and 6)development of optimum-based design criteria and assessment              
              of current design code provisions.  The collaborative study should             
              provide a unique opportunity to obtain and validate statistically              
              the new results for improving current design practice.
