Abstract    :
              This is a proposal to purchase a new electron microscope                       
              containing an integrated imaging electron energy                               
              spectrometer to replace an old microscope purchased in 1975.                   
              The electron energy spectrometer can be used in several                        
              modes.  The simplest mode improves the acuity of images by                     
              removing inelastically scattered electrons from the imaging                    
              pathway.  The contrast of images may also be changed by                        
              selecting electrons of different energy loss levels.  A                        
              specific example of the usefulness of this feature is in the                   
              examination of plant or fungal cell wall structure.  Because                   
              many cell wall components interact differently with                            
              electrons, the contrast between the different components can                   
              be enhanced by selecting particular energy windows to screen                   
              electrons.  Improved penetration of label into tissue                          
              sections using boronated antibodies has been achieved using                    
              the electron energy spectrometer for detection.  The new                       
              microscope will be the only electron microscope for the                        
              Plant Science Microscopy Facility.
