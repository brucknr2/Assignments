Abstract    :
              9214087  Perger  This award supports Professor Warren F. Perger of  Michigan
              Technological University for collaborative  research in physics with Professor
              Dirk Trautmann of  the Institute of Theoretical Physics of the University  of
              Basel, Switzerland.  The objective of their joint  research is to accurately
              calculate the relativistic  ionization form factor.  Their research plan 
              effectively exploits their complementary expertise.   They will work with data
              produced by the experimental  group at Basel, testing a computer program
              developed  by Professor Trautmann, and using atomic continuum  wave functions
              generated by a program written by  Professor Beers.  This will give Professor
              Beers  valuable experience in applying his computational  expertise to a
              realistic atomic physics problem.    The nature of relativistic effects on
              ionization  cross-sections is not well understood.  Detailed  knowledge of the
              ionization cross section, which can  be obtained from the ionization form
              factor, is of  great importance in many applications of atomic  collision
              theory to plasma physics and in studies of  the physics of stellar atmospheres.
