Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The genesis and stabilization of small platinum particles in                   
              zeolite L are being investigated.  The inorganic chemistry that                
              occurs between the time that the platinum salt is placed in contact            
              with the zeolite and the formation of the final platinum particle              
              is investigated using temperature-programmed reduction (TPR)                   
              followed by observations of X-ray absorption (chemical shift and               
              near-edge structure ?XANES!) and hydrogen consumption; the                     
              structures of the platinum species before initiation of TPR, at                
              stages during, and after complete reduction to platinum metal                  
              determined by extended X-ray absorption catalytic reaction probes              
              (neopentane isomerization and u-hexane aromatization), and X-ray               
              absorption are used to investigate destabilization of small                    
              platinum particles in zeolite L, including particle growth,                    
              deactivation by hydrocarbon residue during reaction, sulfur                    
              poisoning, and sulfur-promoted migration.                                      
                                                                                             
              Platinum in zeolite L is one of the fastest-growing catalysts in               
              volume.  It has valuable applications in the chemical and petroleum            
              industries.  Its principal use is in the upgrading of heavy crudes             
              to high-octave gasoline, although it has other applications in                 
              chemical synthesis and environmental control as well.
