Abstract    :
                   Professor Becker will continue his investigations into the                
              role of electron spin when electrons impact on heavy noble gas                 
              atoms.  The angular distribution of scattered electrons will                   
              permit the Becker group to characterize the correlated behavior                
              between photons emitted coincident with the electrons scattered.               
              Such measurements detail the mechanism by which the incoming                   
              electron energy and spin angular momentum are redistributed                    
              between the outgoing scattered electrons and the electronically                
              excited target.
