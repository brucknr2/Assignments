Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Small particles and film surfaces are studied using high resolution            
              electron microscopy under ultrahigh vacuum conditions, coupled with            
              analyses using theoretical modeling and simulation.  The small                 
              particle research emphasizes experimental analysis of quasi-molten             
              behavior of nanoparticles employing a systematic examination of                
              real-time structural evolution.  The surface research examines                 
              surface reconstructions in thin films.  Plan view imaging of                   
              surfaces in transmission electra microscopy focusses on the                    
              interaction of bulk defects with surface reconstructions in gold               
              and iridium.  Critical to the research is the application of                   
              ultrahigh vacuum environments to maintain surfaces free of                     
              contamination.                                                                 
              %%%                                                                            
              The properties of nanoparticles and thin film surfaces depend in               
              part on their surface structures.  This research explores the use              
              of high resolution electron microscopy to quantitatively describe              
              the atomic arrangements on the surfaces of small particles and thin            
              films.
