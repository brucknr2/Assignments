Abstract    :
              This project makes use of a soft x-ray monochromator and a time-of-            
              flight electron spectrometer in combination with an ultra fast                 
              laser-produced plasma x-ray source to create a novel facility for              
              x-ray studies with sub-picosecond time resolution.  This setup will            
              be the first of its kind, and will be used to study dynamic                    
              processes in materials using time-resolved x-ray techniques.  It               
              will also be possible to study the physics of x-ray emissions from             
              sub-picosecond laser-produced plasmas at higher spectral and                   
              temporal resolution than was previously possible.  Specifically, a             
              high-intensity femtosecond laser system is used to create an ultra             
              fast x-ray source.  This is done by focusing the laser pulses onto             
              a solid target to repetitively create a hot, dense plasma.  The                
              plasma emits an incoherent burst of x-rays with time duration less             
              than one picosecond.  A collecting optic will focus a portion of               
              these x-rays into an imaging soft x-ray monochromator, which will              
              both image and energy select the x-rays, creating an output beam               
              with an energy width of about one tenth of an electron volt.  The              
              x-ray beam is used for pump-probe studies of ultra fast processes.             
              A visible wavelength pump pulse will excite a solid surface, with              
              the x-ray pulse used as a probe.
