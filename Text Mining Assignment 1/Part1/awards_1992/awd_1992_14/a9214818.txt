Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Direct Numerical Simulation (DNS) will be carried out in a                     
              study of the effect of compressibility on several vortex                       
              dynamics phenomena in turbulent shear flow. The study is                       
              focused on vortex reconnection, vortex core dynamics, and the                  
              interaction between organized vortex structures and                            
              disorganized background turbulence. A novel feature of the                     
              research is an analysis of the effect of initial condition on                  
              numerical compressible flow                                                    
              simulations.                                                                   
                                                                                             
              This research impacts both the technology of high speed flows                  
              and                                                                            
              the technology of simulating these and other turbulent flows                   
              numerically with greater accuracy and economy.
