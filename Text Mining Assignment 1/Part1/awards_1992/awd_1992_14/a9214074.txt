Abstract    :
              Phase I of this study had examined the design characteristics of               
              machinery enclosures as an application for noise control by                    
              active cancellation. Reduction of noise transmitted through                    
              structures is a need that pervades a wide variety of situations.               
              In this approach, noise reduction at low frequency is achieved                 
              via active control concepts, and at high frequency--using passive              
              control. Performance estimates for control demonstrate the need                
              for multiple actuators to cancel enclosure transmitted noise                   
              throughout the active control frequency range over the full                    
              spectrum of spatial angles. In Phase II of this research project,              
              the emphasis is on developing analytical and numerical models of               
              three-dimensional enclosures and assessing the role of                         
              structural-parameters in achieving the objectives of a low-                    
              frequency noise filter; evaluating surface observer options;                   
              developing cost-effective approaches for actuating the surface                 
              panels; evaluating alternative sensors and design concepts for                 
              embedding them into a surface panel module; developing a specific              
              design for a prototype enclosure including primary structure and               
              surface modules with sensors and actuators; and experimentally                 
              evaluating the above concepts using the prototype enclosure.***//
