              Program Summary:                                                               
              The Academic Research Infrastructure (ARI) program supports 1)                 
              acquisition or development of major research instrumentation,                  
              and/or 2) repair, renovation, or in exceptional cases, replacement             
              of obsolete science and engineering research facilities. This                  
              proposal from Scripps Institute of Oceanography (SIO) requests                 
              funds to renovate three old instruments (an electron probe, a X-ray            
              diffractometer, and a scanning transmission electron microscope)               
              and to replace an X-ray fluorescence system.  The instruments will             
              be maintained and operated as part of SIO's Analytical Facility,               
              which houses major instrumentation and makes it available to all of            
              the University's qualified staff and students.  The instrumentation            
              will improve the University's research and teaching capabilities.              
              Matching funds will be provided by the University.
