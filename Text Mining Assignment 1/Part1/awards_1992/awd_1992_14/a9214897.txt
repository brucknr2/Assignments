Abstract    :
              This award is part of the Arctic System Science (ARCSS) Program,               
              a U.S. Global Change Program.  The research project relates changes            
              in the thickness of the active layer to variations in seasonal                 
              climate across representative Arctic Alaska landscapes.  A network             
              of long-term observational sites, based at locations with histories            
              of prior studies and data will be established.  The primary focus              
              of this study will be a thin layer of soil above the permafrost                
              which thaws and freezes on an annual basis and is known as the                 
              "active layer".  This soil-active layer mediates biological,                   
              biogeochemcial, hydrological, geomorphic, and other heat and mass              
              transfer processes.  This project is a component of a larger                   
              interdisciplinary program known as the ARCSS FLUX Program.
