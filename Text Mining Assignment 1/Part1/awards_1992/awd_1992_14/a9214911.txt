Abstract    :
              The E. coli genome analysis efforts are likely to be the first                 
              which will achieve a complete sequence analysis of a free-living               
              organism.  The extensive genetic, physiological and biochemical                
              analysis of E. coli make this the best defined of all organisms.               
              It is critical to integrate these bodies of information.  This                 
              meeting will be held on September 10-14, 1992, in Madison WI,                  
              bringing together leading researchers, in the analysis of genomes              
              at the genetic, evolutionary, and sequence levels, and will                    
              facilitate the coordination of the structural and functional                   
              analysis of this organism's genome.  Databases and sequence                    
              technology and analysis will be emphasized.
