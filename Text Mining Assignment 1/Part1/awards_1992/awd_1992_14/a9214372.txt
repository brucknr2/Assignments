Abstract    :
              This is a proposal to acquire a gas chromatograph-combustion-                  
              isotope ratio mass spectrometry instrument.  The apparatus                     
              inclues a capillary gas chromatograph used to separate                         
              organic compounds, a combustion interface utilized to                          
              convert carbon compounds into CO2, and a sensitive isotope                     
              ratio mass spectrometer equipped with a triple collector, a                    
              mechanism to switch to a standard gas, and the electronics                     
              for simultaneous recording of major CO2 ions.                                  
              Projects to be pursued include sedimenary biogeochemical                       
              processes that are driven by microbial transformations of                      
              organic matter;  organic matter deposition occurring near                      
              the sediment-water interface;  chemosynthetic pathways and                     
              the fossil record; and sources and fates of amino acids.
