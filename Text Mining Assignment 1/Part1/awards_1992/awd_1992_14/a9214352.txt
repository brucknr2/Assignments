Abstract    :
                   The Biology Department of Seton Hall                                      
              University proposes to renovate and convert a 1200                             
              square foot laboratory into two research                                       
              laboratories and a common instrument room for two                              
              new faculty members with expertise in cell                                     
              signalling and molecular biology respectively.                                 
              The area has been dedicated to cell culture and                                
              classical virology.  This facility has not                                     
              received major attention since 1951.                                           
                   The present laboratory space is poorly                                    
              designed to accommodate new faculty.  For example,                             
              there is a 400 square foot glassware washing room                              
              but no equivalent research area.  The temporary                                
              walls that were constructed in 1968, divide the                                
              space up into an extremely inefficient suite of                                
              rooms without adequate ventilation and utilities.                              
              The area will be gutted, walls will be constructed                             
              to better divide the facilities and a new HVAC                                 
              unit will be put in to provide much needed                                     
              ventilation.  Two new laminar flow hoods as well                               
              as a fume hood will be added.  All new laboratory                              
              benches with appropriate utilities will be                                     
              installed.                                                                     
                   NSF funding of this proposal will facilitate                              
              a symbiosis of research activity between new and                               
              veteran faculty.
