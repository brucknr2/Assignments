Abstract    :
              This is a SGER proposal whose objectives are to (a), investigate,              
              both theoretically and experimentally, a new, fast high resolution             
              Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) technique based on the discrete               
              wavelet transform, and (b), establish (at least, experimentally)               
              its feasibility and superiority over contemporary MRI approaches.              
              The anticipated advantages of the proposed new approach include a              
              dramatic reduction in the overall imaging time with no reduction               
              in resolution or contrast.
