Abstract    :
                   This award provides support for a research conference in                  
              differential equations.  It combines the activities of two                     
              conference series which were held for many years in the                        
              southeastern and midwestern regions of the country.  They provide              
              an opportunity for exchanges among the many investigators of the               
              regions who are otherwise not funded.  In addition, funds are                  
              directed primarily for subsistence and travel for graduate                     
              students and young researchers.  A smaller fraction is directed                
              toward expenses of principal speakers, some of whom must                       
              travel considerable distances.                                                 
                   There is appreciable support provided by the University of                
              Kentucky and the Institute for Mathematics and its Applications.               
              Combining these funds with those of the Foundation, it is                      
              expected that a conference attracting over 175 participants                    
              with100-120 scheduled talks will be possible.  In all, this                    
              amounts to an excellent investment of public funds.
