Abstract    :
              This award supports Professor Guy Schupp, Dr. William Yelon and two            
              graduate students of the University of Missouri to collaborate in              
              research on glassy materials and ferroelectric phase transitions               
              with Professor Walter Steiner and others of the Physics Department             
              of the Technical University of Vienna.  They are engaged in detailed           
              investigations of the spin dynamics of cluster glasses above their             
              freezing temperatures and the dynamics of the phase transition of              
              lithium heptagermanate.  These dynamical processes have been studied           
              using high magnetic field, low temperature facilities in Vienna.               
              Recently, the neutron and gamma ray scattering instruments at the              
              Missouri University Research Reactor (MURR) have been significantly            
              upgraded.  This enables them to carry out expanded structural                  
              studies and examinations of dynamical and magnetic properties near             
              phase transitions.                                                             
                                                                                             
              The combination of complementary techniques made possible by the               
              unique facilities at MURR and those in Vienna may provide new and              
              fundamental insights into magnetic ordering and the dynamics of                
              phase transitions in glassy and ferroelectric materials.
