              Program Summary:                                                               
                                                                                             
              The Academic Research Infrastructure (ARI) program supports 1)                 
              acquisition or development of major research instrumentation,                  
              and/or 2) repair, renovation, or in exceptional cases, replacement             
              of obsolete science and engineering research facilities. This                  
              proposal from the University of South Florida (USF) requests funds             
              to purchase an transmission electron microscope.  The instrument               
              will be operated as a shared-use facility to support research and              
              teaching efforts of scientists in the St. Petersburg/Tampa area at             
              USF and Eckerd College.  The instrument will be housed in the new              
              Marine Science Building at USF, and USF will provide a full-time               
              technician to support the instrument.  The University will also                
              supply matching funds to purchase the instrument.
