Abstract    :
              This proposal is for funds to purchase                                         
              equipment for research in pollution monitoring                                 
              technology and for salary support for some of                                  
              the researchers.  The requested equipment                                      
              consists of an ultraviolet differential optical                                
              absorption spectrometer, a Fourier transform                                   
              infrared spectrometer, and components and                                      
              instrumentation for building a millimeter-wave                                 
              monitoring system.  Among the pollution                                        
              studies planned are to develop a multispectral                                 
              technique to continuously monitor nitrogen                                     
              and sulfur oxides and volatile organic                                         
              compounds emitted during industrial processes,                                 
              from superfund sites, wastewater treatment                                     
              plants, and polluted surface waters.
