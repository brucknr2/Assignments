Abstract    :
               This NSF award will be utilized to renovate approximately 5,600 square feet of
              research space in the Steele Laboratory of Electrical Sciences on the campus of
              the California Institute of Technology.  Steele Lab is approximately 30 years
              old, and the renovation will retrofit the facility to the changed emphasis of
              Cal Tech electrical engineering research programs.  In addition, it will
              consolidate researchers into one facility to work together on interdisciplinary
              projects in communications and automatic control.  All seven project faculty
              have joined the faculty in the last ten years.  Specific renovation activities
              include construction of a unique high bay area to house a flexible structure
              experiment as well as a distillation column of sufficient size to mimic actual
              industrial problems.  A local area network will be established to increase
              researcher interaction and to overcome the inefficiencies associated with use
              of the campus backbone system which is approaching maximum capacity.  The
              project will have an important impact on faculty growth and student enrollment,
              including minorities and women, in the competitive area of communications and
              automatic control.
