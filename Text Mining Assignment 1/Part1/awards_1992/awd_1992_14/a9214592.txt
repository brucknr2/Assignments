Abstract    :
              In this proposal, the P.I. describe a research                                 
              program focused on the RF properties of                                        
              superconductors, the relevant physics, and                                     
              device applications.  Particular focus is on the                               
              RF properties of thin films to the high-Tc                                     
              cuprate superconductors; the properties of                                     
              nanoscale superconducting transmission lines                                   
              for which nonlinearties and finite relaxation                                  
              effects become important, and nonlinear wave                                   
              device applications of series array Josephson                                  
              junction transmission lines.  The work involves                                
              RF measurements, device modeling and circuit                                   
              simulation, as required.  The work is being                                    
              carried out in association with a larger,                                      
              emerging program at Stanford on                                                
              cryoelectronics.
