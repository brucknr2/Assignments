Abstract    :
              This award in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic                  
              Chemistry Program is made to Dr. Daniel A. Straus of the                       
              Chemistry Department, San Jose State University to study                       
              zirconium-based alkylation of organic substrates.                              
              Alkylzirconocene compounds in the presence of strong bases                     
              promote either alkylation of aldehydes and ketones to form                     
              alcohols or abstraction of alpha-protons to yield enolates.                    
              Straus will expand the range of such reactions and investigate                 
              the mechanism by which they occur.  The reactions may involve                  
              the formation of an anionic zirconium complex or the production                
              of a mixed alkoxide alkyl compound.                                            
              %%%                                                                            
              Alkyl zirconium compounds have been extensively studied under                  
              acidic conditions because of their utility in olefin                           
              polymerization and metathesis.  Here, the compounds will be                    
              studied under basic conditions, in which preliminary studies                   
              have shown they can be effective in some circumstances in                      
              forming carbon-carbon bonds.  There is potential for the                       
              research to identify some reactions that will be valuable for                  
              synthetic organic chemistry.  The project will be carried out                  
              primarily by undergraduate students and will provide an                        
              opportunity for them to learn a variety of advanced laboratory                 
              skills.
