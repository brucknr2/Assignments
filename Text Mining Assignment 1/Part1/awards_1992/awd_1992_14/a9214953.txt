Abstract    :
              This award is part of the Arctic System Science (ARCSS) Program,               
              a U.S. Global Change Program.  This research will use                          
              climatological and sounding data, as well as a radiative transfer              
              model to examine the energy transfer from the atmosphere to the                
              snow surface, which in turn will lead to better parameterization               
              of the process of spring snow line retreat.  The project will                  
              utilize two approaches; the first involves expanding the study of              
              roughly 40 years of historical weather data, including snow                    
              depths, precipitations, surface temperatures, and atmospheric                  
              soundings, at four Alaska stations.  The second involves using a               
              state-of-the-art radiative transfer model to examine the                       
              theoretical effects of changing cloud cover, and relative                      
              humidity on the actual transfer of energy from the atmosphere to               
              melt snow.  These results will be used together to simulate snow               
              melt in atmospheric models.
