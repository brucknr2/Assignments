Abstract    :
              In Seismic Zone 4, there are many older, existing buildings                    
              that do not meet the lateral strength, drift control, and                      
              ductile detailing requirements of the 1991 Uniform Building                    
              Code.  A preliminary study using hypothetical buildings                        
              indicates the additional strength, stiffness, and energy                       
              dissipation can be provided by a non-invasive retrofit                         
              scheme involving the replacement of the existing cladding                      
              with structural (steel) panels and energy dissipating                          
              cladding-to-frame connections.  To examine this retrofit                       
              scheme in detail, two older, existing buildings will be                        
              studied.  A preliminary design will be done first, which                       
              includes:  (1) design decisions regarding the relative                         
              structural contributions of the existing frames and the                        
              cladding system to the retrofit building system; and (2) for                   
              the cladding system, design of practical cladding-to-frame                     
              connections and their attachments, and development of a                        
              design procedure for the cladding panels.  The feasibility                     
              of this seismic retrofit scheme will be assessed                               
              analytically by subjecting the retrofit perimeter frames to                    
              a set of ground motions with ranges of peak ground                             
              accelerations, predominant frequencies, and durations.  The                    
              research will advance the state-of-the-art in passive                          
              control of structures in two ways:  (1) by identifying                         
              conditions under which the structural characteristics of                       
              cladding and cladding-to-frame connections can be effective                    
              and efficient, and (2) by providing a foundation for the                       
              development of rational guidelines for the designs of energy                   
              dissipating cladding systems for either existing weak                          
              buildings or newly designed buildings.
