Abstract    :
                   Research in intermediate energy nuclear physics will be                   
              carried out at IUCF, LAMPF, BNL, and NIKHEF, focussing on                      
              nuclear structure and determination of the effective nucleon-                  
              nucleon interaction.  Polarization transfer reactions will be                  
              used to explore the tensor, central, and spin-orbits                           
              components of the interaction.  Measurements with different                    
              probes, together with a careful choice of nuclear states, such                 
              as the stretch states transitions with maximal angular                         
              momentum transfer, will be used to obtain a much refined view                  
              of the different components.  Information on shell model                       
              occupation numbers, shapes of radial orbitals, core                            
              polarization, meson exchange currents, and relativistic                        
              effects will also be obtained from this work.  Multi-nucleon                   
              knockout experiments on the structure of few body systems will                 
              be carried out at BNL using linearly polarized gamma rays.                     
              Planning of experiments for electron scattering extensions of                  
              this latter work will be carried out.
