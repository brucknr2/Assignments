Abstract    :
                   The proposal requests funds for renovation of                             
              research space for the Department of Microbiology                              
              and Immunology (M&I).  The proposed renovation will                            
              solve numerous problems.  Floors, lighting and                                 
              finishes will be replaced and numerous code                                    
              violations eliminated.  Aisle space will be                                    
              redesigned to facilitate multiple users and                                    
              interactions or access by the handicapped.                                     
              Facilities for tissue culture and monoclonal                                   
              antibody production will be improved for training                              
              graduate students. The renovated facility will                                 
              enhance the recruitment of additional faculty and                              
              graduate students, and the present externally                                  
              funded research projects of M&I. It will also                                  
              enhance M&I's appropriate participation in NSF                                 
              funded outreach programs at the university,                                    
              including programs to motivate women and minority                              
              students toward a career in science and to provide                             
              hands-on training for elementary school teachers in                            
              the biological sciences.                                                       
                   The renovation stresses open laboratories that                            
              maximize encounters between groups of researchers.                             
              This will facilitate mentorism between established,                            
              funded faculty and incoming new investigators, to                              
              increase interactions among a small number of                                  
              faculty to increase scientific cooperation and the                             
              development of new and exciting areas of research,                             
              and to accommodate the use of communal laboratory                              
              equipment.
