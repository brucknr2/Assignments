Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              We anticipate an era in which superconductors form the                         
              basis for a whole new industry of high performance                             
              electronics.  These electronics frontiers include the use                      
              of Josephson-coupled superconductors, proximity-coupled                        
              superconductor/normal metal materials, and ultra-small                         
              (normal and superconducting) tunnel junctions which are                        
              sensitive to the presence of single electrons.  As these                       
              technologies develop we have an excellent opportunity to                       
              study the fundamental physical processes which give rise to                    
              them.  However, conventional low-Tc superconductors (which                     
              are most promising for all of these applications) are very                     
              sensitive to impurities, such as oxygen, water vapor and                       
              carbon contaminates.  Hence it is necessary to produce                         
              these materials in ultra-high vacuum (UHV) thin film                           
              deposition systems.   We will assemble a UHV, three-gun                        
              sputtering system for making superconducting,                                  
              superconductor/insulator and superconductor/semiconductor                      
              multilayer structures as well as many other non-oxide                          
              superconductors for use in studying fundamental physical                       
              processes in solids.
