              Description:  This project provides support for                                
              U.S. scientists to participate in the Puri                                     
              Winter School on: "Particle Physics and                                        
              Cosmology at the Interface" which will take                                    
              place from Jan.2-20, 1993.  It proposes to                                     
              emphasize the rich and exciting frontiers that                                 
              are at the crossroads of these two major                                       
              research areas.  This area of physics has not                                  
              been covered in recent years in India from a                                   
              unified perspective.  The topics to be covered                                 
              include the standard models of particle physics                                
              and of cosmology; neutrino physics; fermion                                    
              masses and mixings; physics beyond the standard                                
              models including (a) grand unification, (b)                                    
              supersymmetry, (c) superstring phenomenology                                   
              and (d) dynamical schemes on the origin of                                     
              masses and families; inflation, dark matter,                                   
              baryogenesis and related areas.  Lecturers are                                 
              from the U.S., Europe, FSU, and Asia.  Students                                
              are from Bangladesh, China, Sri Lanka,                                         
              Pakistan, India and Nepal (BCSPIN).  Fifty                                     
              percent of the students will be from India.                                    
                                                                                             
              Scope:  The exposure of students and young                                     
              researchers to lectures by world renowned                                      
              scientists greatly strengthens the scientific                                  
              potential in these countries, and fosters                                      
              scientific cooperation between the developing                                  
              countries and the U.S. and, particularly,                                      
              between India and the U.S.  This school is the                                 
              fourth in a series of highly successful schools                                
              that were designed to promote interest in                                      
              physics research in the BCSPIN region.  It is                                  
              supported financially and organizationally by
