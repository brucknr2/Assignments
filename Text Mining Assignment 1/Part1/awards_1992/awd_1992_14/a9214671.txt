Abstract    :
              The primary focus of the research is the number theoretic                      
              aspects of computational problems.  In recent years there has                  
              been a resurgence of interest in this area.  Ancient problems                  
              have been solved(e.g. primality testing), new subdisciplines                   
              have been spawned (e.g. public-key cryptography) and deep                      
              mathematical tools have emerged (e.g. Abelian varieties, class                 
              field theory).                                                                 
                                                                                             
              One area of particular interest is the new 'number field                       
              sieve'.  This collection of algorithms, developed by many                      
              researchers, is the most significant advance in integer                        
              factoring in the last quarter century.  The PI will continue                   
              to investigate improvements and generalizations of this                        
              method.  The application of the number field sieve to the                      
              discrete logarithm problem is of particular interest.                          
                                                                                             
              A second area of interest is the application of recent results                 
              to public-key cryptography.  The United States Government has                  
              recently proposed a national 'Digital Signature Standard'                      
              (DSS).  The proposed signature scheme is controversial and the                 
              potential of several methods will be investigated, including                   
              the number field sieve, for breaking the proposed system or                    
              for introducing 'trapdoors'.  Another area of investigation                    
              involves the development of new mathematical tools.
