Abstract    :
                   This award supports basic research on mathematical topics                 
              at the foundation of nonequilibrium physics.  Theoretical                      
              aspects of nonlinear and stochastic dynamical systems will be                  
              studied using predominantly analytic techniques and also                       
              numerical simulations.  The work will focus on the effect of                   
              fluctuations on non-linear wave propagation in diffuse-                        
              reaction systems and on turbulent dynamics in continuum models                 
              represented by the Navier-Stokes and complex Ginzburg-Landau                   
              equations.
