Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              New schemes to accurately parameterize the sub-grid effects of                 
              bottom topography in Ocean General Circulation Models (OGCMs) will             
              be tested. Of particular interest is a more realistic prediction of            
              the separation point of topographically steered boundary current               
              like the Gulf Stream.
