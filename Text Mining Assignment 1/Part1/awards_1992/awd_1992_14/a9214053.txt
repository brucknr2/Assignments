Abstract    :
                   This award will help defray costs of publishing a multi-                  
              authored volume entitled Systematics, Historical Ecology, and                  
              North American Freshwater Fishes, which is the result of a                     
              symposium held in 1988 at the meetings of the American Society of              
              Ichthyology and Herpetology.  This monograph will be a landmark                
              volume on the ecology, historical ecology and systematics of                   
              American freshwater fishes.  As the only compendium of it's kind,              
              it will be an invaluable reference work and textbook for                       
              professionals and students who study fishes.  The monograph will               
              also bear on studies of freshwater resources and fish management               
              in North America.
