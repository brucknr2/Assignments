Abstract    :
                   This proposed workshop on Sources, Transport, Energization and            
              Loss of Magnetospheric Plasmas will focus on all aspects of the                
              modeling of magnetospheric plasmas, and specifically will tie in to            
              the international Solar Terrestrial Energy Program (STEP), the                 
              upcoming ISTP and IMI spacecraft missions, and the NSF Geospace                
              Environment Modeling (GEM) program.  Workshop sessions will involve            
              seven oral sessions including four tutorial talks per session with             
              extended discussion time.  These sessions will cover the topics of             
              Distribution, Sources, Transport, Energization, Loss, Imaging, and             
              Synthesis (summary of existing consensus and outstanding issues).              
              Contributed papers will be in two evening poster sessions.  The                
              workshop will be held at Guntersville Lodge south of Huntsville,               
              Alabama.
