Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This award is to acquire a networked infrastructure of imaging                 
              equipment.  The equipment will be used in interdisciplinary                    
              projects involving the Department of Engineering at the Colorado               
              School of Mines.  The primary use of the equipment is for                      
              visualization of 2 and 3 dimensional fields related to materials,              
              structures, and flow phenomena. Civil, Mechanical, and Electrical              
              Engineering will all benefit from this award.                                  
                                                                                             
              The proposed equipment will consist of high speed graphic                      
              processors with associated image capturing and processing equipment            
              all networked together with high speed links.
