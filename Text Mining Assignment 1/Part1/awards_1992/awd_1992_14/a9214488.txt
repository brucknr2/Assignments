Abstract    :
              Shu  9214488  The objective of this proposed  research is to develop accurate
              and  stable algorithms, based on the  essentially non-oscillatory (ENO) 
              methodology, which were originally  designed for general hyperbolic 
              conservation laws and in particular  for the compressible Euler  equations in
              gas dynamics, to  device simulations in two and  eventually in three space 
              dimensions.  The emphasis will be   on simulating the hydrodynamioc  (HD) model
              and the recently  developed Energy-Transport (ET)  model and investigating
              their  physical applications.  Issues  related to device simulations, such  as
              the choice of boundary  conditions based upon physical as  well as numerical
              considerations,  the adequate handling of boundary  and inner layers (high
              gradient  regions), the adequate handling of  mild singularities in the
              potential  due to the boundary conditions, the  adequate handling of possibly
              stiff  source terms, and parallel  implementation of the algorithm  will be
              investigated.  The eventual  goal of the effort is to develop a  numerical
              algorithm which is  accurate and robust, suitable for  device simulations using
              not only  the HD and ET models but also other  models as well.  Physical 
              applications of related models will  also be investigated in  collaboration
              with other applied  mathematicians, device physicists  and engineers.  ***
