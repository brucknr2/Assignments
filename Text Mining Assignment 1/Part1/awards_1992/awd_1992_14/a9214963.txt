Abstract    :
               This project investigates computer technology in   of the representation and
              manipulation of mathematical  notation by the computer.  The long-term goal is
              to produce a  consistent and constructive representation of a substantial, 
              useful class of engineering and applied mathematics, driven   the needs of
              significant applications.  Key issues to examine  include the use of multiple
              representations, and the encoding  of geometric, algebraic, logical,
              algorithmic, and physical  relations in symbolic mathematical computation.  The
              specific  topics to study include:  (1) developing new algorithms and
              representations for  manipulation of functions of a complex variable  correctly
              and with some generality (In particular  both correct manipulations and proofs
              in analysis  must account for branch cuts.),  (2) providing a computing
              framework for dealing with  mathematical derivations, theorem proving, and 
              manipulation,  (3) providing a practical approach to a bounded-time version  of
              the zero-equivalence problem for algebraic  expressions, and  (4) exploring of
              parallel algorithms for basic polynomial  algorithms and pattern-directed
              transformations.
