Abstract    :
              This research addresses the                                                    
              operation of networked multi-user,                                             
              multi-computer systems encompassing                                            
              a variety of architectures and                                                 
              computing capabilities.  The                                                   
              problems of particular concern are                                             
              assignment of software to computers                                            
              jobs to avoid unbalanced loads, and                                            
              dynamic scheduling of jobs assigned                                            
              to a set of identical processors.                                              
              Resolution of these problems is                                                
              vital to progress from networked

              environments to a "meta-computer,"                                             
              i.e., an efficient, convenient                                                 
              computing environment which                                                    
              automatically allocates job among a                                            
              variety of available computers.  A
