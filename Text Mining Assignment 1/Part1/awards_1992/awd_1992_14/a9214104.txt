Abstract    :
              The High-Performance Computing and Communications                              
              initiativeincludes four components, one of which is the National               
              Research and Education Network (NREN).  The NREN initative provides            
              for research sponsored by Federal agencies on a variety of                     
              networking technologies.  The National Science Foundation has                  
              funded research allowing NSFNET backbone services to be provided at            
              45 million bits per second.  The Department of Energy (DOE) is                 
              funding investigations into high-speed cell-switching                          
              architectures, and inconjunction with NASA is fielding an ATM-based            
              network to connect DOE and NASA sites and academic and industry                
              researchers funded by the two agencies.  This award funds a link               
              between the NSFNET and the new DOE/NASA internet.  The award                   
              enables the evaluation of the packet-switched NSFNET as it connects            
              to the cell-switched ATM network, as well as consideration of ATM              
              routing and addressing,management tools, and performance analysis.
