Abstract    :
              The long-term goals of the seminar are to provide bridge engineers             
              from diverse backgrounds, industry, academia, or government with               
              a forum to assimilate, exchange, or become educated on the                     
              technological aspects of cable-stayed bridges.  Cable-stayed                   
              bridges have become a popular and cost-effective alternative to                
              suspension bridges since the Second World War.  With the proven                
              benefits of cable-stayed bridge crossings in the United States and             
              the world, still many government, consulting and academic engineers            
              are not investigating the use of the bridge type.  One can only                
              speculate that a possible lack of understanding of cable-stayed                
              bridge behavior and performance aspects are the cause.  Thus, the              
              seminar's major objective is to educate the attendees on the                   
              overall aspect of cable-stayed bridge technology.  Renowned                    
              speakers from the United States will lecture to participants in a              
              two-day seminar format tentatively set for April, 1993, in Miami,              
              Florida.
