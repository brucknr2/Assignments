Abstract    :
                   The University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign                            
              by renovating their Mechanical Engineering                                     
              Laboratory will collocate select research                                      
              activities in the departments of Aeronautical and                              
              Astronautical Engineering, Chemical Engineering,                               
              Materials Science and Engineering, Mechanical and                              
              Industrial Engineering, Nuclear Engineering, and                               
              Theoretical and Applied Mechanics.  Such                                       
              collocation will allow cross-disciplinary research                             
              to flourish in areas such as supersonic flow                                   
              research, particle combustion, co-firing of natural                            
              gas and coal, and three dimensional turbulence and                             
              thermal transport mechanisms.  The project will                                
              renovate approximately 6,900 assignable square feet                            
              and will benefit strategic research areas for the                              
              Nation.
