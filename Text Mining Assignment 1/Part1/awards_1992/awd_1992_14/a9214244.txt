Abstract    :
              The research is concerned with the discovery and development                   
              of adaptive routing protocols for massively parallel                           
              architectures using Hypercube Interconnection Networks (HINs).                 
              This class includes the well known binary n-cube, k-ary n-                     
              cube, and multidimensional arrays.                                             
                                                                                             
              A taxonomy of routing protocols is developed and used to focus                 
              attention on distinct classes.  Two new concepts will be                       
              developed and explored in this study.  First, the properties                   
              of conservatism and optimism of these protocols will be                        
              rigorously characterized.  The effect of these properties on                   
              message latency, network bandwidth, and network topology will                  
              be studied.  Second, the class of multi-phase protocols will                   
              be introduced and developed.  These are protocols whose                        
              behavior is a function of the distance of a message from the                   
              destination.  The proposed router architectures will be                        
              modeled and evaluated via simulation.  Particular attention                    
              will be focused on the evaluation of performance in the                        
              presence of implementation constraints such as wiring                          
              complexity, pin count, and link layer protocols.
