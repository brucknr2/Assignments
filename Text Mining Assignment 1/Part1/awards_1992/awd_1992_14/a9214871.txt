Abstract    :
                   This project seeks to develop technology that will bypass the             
              need for genomic walking over long map distances in those cases                
              where the gene to be cloned has been mapped between two restriction            
              fragment markers in an RFLP map of the organism.  The size limit of            
              the clonable region will not be determined by the usual limitations            
              of in vitro cloning because the procedure will involove targeted in            
              vivo genetic recombination between Arabidopsis chromosomes and                 
              specialized Yeast Artifical Chromosome (YAC) vectors.  The central             
              idea is to clone a defined genetic interval of large physical size             
              in a single step into a YAC vector by cell fusion and in vivo                  
              homologous recombination.                                                      
              %%%                                                                            
              The development of this technology will enhance the ability of                 
              scientists using Arabidopsis as a model to clone the entire genome             
              in much less time than is now predicted.
