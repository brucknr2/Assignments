Abstract    :
                   The objective of this faculty internship is to investigate the            
              use of coordination theory and collaboration technology to achieve             
              the most effective integration structures for manufacturing                    
              agility.  The research will include integration of engineering                 
              decisions and designs in the areas of distributed production                   
              planning and quality assurance, within and between plants and under            
              dynamic, changing conditions.                                                  
                   The internship plan includes empirical investigation and                  
              testing of a methodology called Collaboration Requirement Planning             
              within three industrial settings.  Models for computer-assisted                
              collaborative integration, optimal design of team organizations,               
              and the design of protocols for collaboration activities will be               
              analyzed and tested.
