Abstract    :
                   Climate modeling research has shown that the polar regions of             
              the global climate system are the most sensitive to climatic                   
              perturbations.  Therefore, it is felt that global climate change               
              will first be evident in those regions of the Earth.  In this                  
              research program the results of an experiment with a modified                  
              version of the NCAR Community Climate Model (GENESIS/CCM1) that                
              includes sea ice, leads and sea ice transport, will be used to                 
              determine the sensitivity of the climate to sea ice variations, and            
              to identify variables that, through monitoring, could provide an               
              early warning of global climate change.                                        
                                                                                             
                   In this project an analysis of the results of experiments with            
              the GENESIS/CCM1 will be used 1) to determine if the mechanisms of             
              climate change identified in the previous model studies the CCSI               
              model Study occur in the more complex modeled system, 2) to                    
              determine the impact of sea ice on the energy and moisture fluxes              
              at the ocean-atmosphere interface and their effect on climate both             
              globally and regionally, and 3) to examine the possibility that the            
              monitoring of variables associated with sea ice, including lead                
              fraction, snowfall, temperatures, and energy and moisture fluxes,              
              could help provide a prediction of future global climate change.
