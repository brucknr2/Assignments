Abstract    :
              This award is for the development of an interdisciplinary                      
              curriculum for undergraduate students in computer science,                     
              the natural sciences and engineering.  The curriculum will                     
              focus on massively parallel computing and will use Boston                      
              University's 64-node CM-5.  The courses will be project-                       
              oriented emphasizing direct experience with computational                      
              problem-solving in the sciences and with programming in a                      
              massively parallel environement.                                               
                                                                                             
              This award is for the development of an interdisciplinary                      
              curriculum for undergraduate students in computer science,                     
              the natural sciences and engineering.  The six project                         
              oriented courses that are proposed: one in fundamental                         
              methods and five in advanced computational topics, will                        
              emphasize direct experience with computational problem-                        
              solving in the sciences and with programming in a massively                    
              parallel environment.  The results of the curriculum and                       
              materials development will be disseminated through summer                      
              workshops, publications, and presentations at professional                     
              meetings.
