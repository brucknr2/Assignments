Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  This research consists of four main tasks:                                 
                                                                                             
                  1.  Conduct further studies of the moist available energy as               
                  it applies to moist convective instability (the generalized                
                  convective available potential energy), based on the                       
                  penetrator algorithm and building on the previous work of the              
                  PIs.                                                                       
                                                                                             
                  2.  Carry out further development of the prognostic closure                
                  for the Arakawa-Schubert cumulus parameterization, including               
                  studies of the physical meaning of , and the role of multiple             
                  cloud base levels.                                                         
                                                                                             
                  3.  Complete, install, and test the prognostic cloud water                 
                  parameterization that we have developed for the CSU GCM.  This             
                  will include tests in both one-dimensional and three-                      
                  dimensional versions of the model.                                         
                                                                                             
                  4.  Results of the GCM simulations will be compared with                   
                  observations, with emphasis on seasonal changes of the clear-              
                  sky greenhouse effect and the Earth's entropy budget, and                  
                  numerical experiments designed to reveal the sensitivity of                
                  the results to aspects of the model's formulation.                         
                                                                                             
                  This research is important because it seeks to better                     
              understand cloud and energy processes in the Earth's atmosphere in             
              order to be able to represent them more realistically in weather               
              and climate models.
