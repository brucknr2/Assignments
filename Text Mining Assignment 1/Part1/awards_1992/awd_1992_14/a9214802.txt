Abstract    :
              This is an attendance and travel grant for the 1992 International              
              Conference on Application Specific Array Processors.  The                      
              conference is sponsored by the University of California at Berkeley            
              in cooperation with the IEEE Computer Society and is held in                   
              Berkeley California.  The conference emphasize parallel computing,             
              systems, design methodologies technology and implementations within            
              the context of application specific computing.  This is their sixth            
              of a series of conferences which provide an important forum for the            
              discussion and dissemination  of research being done on application            
              specific computing systems in the US, Europe and Japan.
