Abstract    :
                     The goal of this research is to investigate   highly parallel 
              preconditioning techniques for solving general large sparse  linear systems of
              equations.  Of particular interest are   systems that arise from the
              discretization of partial  differential equations on unstructured grids.  The  
              focuses on efficient preconditioners which scale well when   number of
              processors is very large.  In this situation, the  standard incomplete
              factorization preconditioners are not  satisfactory.  The project investigates
              a number of  non-standard alternatives which emphasize approximations   based
              on  ``high level of accuracy.''  These are similar to ILU  factorizations with
              high level of fill-in.  Many of the   parallel preconditioners, suffer from the
              disadvantage that   entail a larger number of iterations than standard 
              preconditioners to achieve convergence.  This often outweighs   potential gains
              arising from the higher degree of   parallelism.  However, recent experience
              suggests that increasing the   of the preconditioner is a good strategy for
              achieving faster  execution by reducing the number of iterations.  The use of  
              multi-coloring techniques is also investigated.
