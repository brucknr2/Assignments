Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This U.S.-Mexico award will support Professor Sandip Pakvasa                   
              and a group of theoretical physicists from the University of                   
              Hawaii in Manoa and the University of Massachusetts at                         
              Amherst, in collaboration with a group of physicists at the                    
              Mexican Centro de Investigacion y de Estudios Avanzados                        
              (CINVESTAV).  The objective of the proposed research is to                     
              study various fundamental questions concerning the standard                    
              model of electro-weak interactions.  In particular, the group plans            
              to investigate radiative corrections in the standard model,                    
              calculate decay rates, polarization effects, and branching ratios in           
              the non-leptonic decays of baryions, pursue theoretical and                    
              phenomenological studies of CP violation, and study models for                 
              Fermion masses and mixings and their implications for collider                 
              physics.                                                                       
                                                                                             
              This research cooperation will unite leading researchers in the                
              U.S., with considerable experimental expertise at colliding beam               
              and non-accelerator physics facilities, with one of the strongest              
              theoretical groups in Mexico in the area of unified models.  The               
              proposed collaboration will serve to enhance interactions                      
              between these active groups and promote the training of                        
              graduate students.
