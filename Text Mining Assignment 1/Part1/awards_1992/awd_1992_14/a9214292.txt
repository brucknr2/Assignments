Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  This proposal requests funds to renovate                                  
              research space (4,328 net square feet) in Olin Hall                            
              for the Departments of Physics/Astronomy and                                   
              Psychology.                                                                    
                   The renovation is part of a detailed, long-                               
              range plan developed by the College.  In 1993                                  
              construction will begin on a new biology building                              
              that will be attached to Olin.  When the Biology                               
              Department leaves for its new quarters, Olin will                              
              be renovated to provide modern research and                                    
              teaching facilities.                                                           
                   The remodeling of the physics/astronomy                                   
              facilities will provide the department with a                                  
              computer laboratory and greatly improved research                              
              facilities in the areas of molecular biophysics,                               
              condensed matter physics, and atomic and nuclear                               
              physics.  Reconfiguration of space and                                         
              modernization of services will allow for greater                               
              flexibility and efficiency which will lead to                                  
              increased productivity.  Graduating an average of                              
              20 majors per year, the Physics/Astronomy                                      
              Department typically has 10-15 students working                                
              with 6 faculty on research during the academic year                            
              and summers.  These collaborations will be greatly                             
              enhanced by the modernization of research                                      
              facilities.                                                                    
                   Currently the Psychology Department labors in                             
              facilities that are extremely small and poorly                                 
              designed for experimental work.  With this                                     
              renovation the Psychology Department hopes to                                  
              obtain the research facilities that can support                                
              properly the level of research activities currently                            
              taking place.  As in Physics/Astronomy, students                               
              are a major part of the Psychology Department                                  
              research program.  Psychology graduates an average                             
              of 30 students a year, and in a typical year, 10-15                            
              students work with 6 faculty on research.
