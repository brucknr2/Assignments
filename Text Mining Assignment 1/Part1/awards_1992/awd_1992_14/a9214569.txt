Abstract    :
              Doctors Gray and Winkler of CalTech will investigate the                       
              photochemistry of modified metalloenzymes with support from the                
              Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic Program of the                     
              Chemistry Division and the Biophysics Program of the Molecular                 
              and Biochemical Sciences Division.  These workers will combine                 
              methods and systems from inorganic chemistry, physical                         
              chemistry, and molecular biology to custom design light-driven                 
              multielectron redox enzymes.  They will photoinitiate                          
              single-electron-transfer reactions that will result in                         
              formation of oxo-iron (ferryl) species in variants of                          
              cytochrome c and myoglobin.  These proteins will be tailored                   
              for ferryl formation by use of semisynthetic and site-directed                 
              mutagenesis techniques.  Histidine residues for ruthenium                      
              binding will be introduced at surface sites on the proteins,                   
              and alterations in the protein heme environments will adapt the                
              protein to support ferryl species in the active sites.  Upon                   
              photolysis, electron transfer between the ruthemium and heme                   
              moieties will lead to ferryl formation.                                        
              %%%                                                                            
              An important intermediate species in many reactions of dioxygen                
              that are catalyzed by heme proteins is one that contains the                   
              iron atom of the heme bound to an oxygen atom.  These "ferryl"                 
              species in the past have proven difficult to characterize                      
              because of their high reactivity.  A novel and powerful method                 
              to generate and detect them will be developed that depends                     
              first on using methods of molecular biology to engineer the                    
              proteins so as to facilitate electron transfer reactions that                  
              can be driven by a short flash of laser light.  The ferryl                     
              species will then be detected by use of their optical                          
              properties, and information on their reactivity will be                        
              obtained directly.
