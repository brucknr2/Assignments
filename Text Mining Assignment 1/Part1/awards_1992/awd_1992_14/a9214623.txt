Abstract    :
              The Microelectronics Facility at                                               
              Brown University requires funds to                                             
              upgrade clean-rooms.  One thousand                                             
              square feet of facility space will                                             
              be upgraded to class-1000, or                                                  
              better, clean-room grade. In                                                   
              addition, some obsolete and broken                                             
              equipment will be replaced.  It is                                             
              proposed that the funds be used  to                                            
              purchase rapid thermal processors
