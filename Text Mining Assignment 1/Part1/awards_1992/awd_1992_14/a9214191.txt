Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This modern helium liquefaction system in the Department of                    
              Physics at the University of Florida will be capable of                        
              meeting the full needs of all the research groups in the                       
              Physics Department including the Microkelvin Research                          
              Laboratory, and also the needs of groups in Chemistry,                         
              Materials Science and Engineering, Radiology, Astronomy,                       
              and Geology on the campus of the University of Florida.                        
              The system will produce 75 liters per hour that will                           
              satisfy current and estimated needs of a planned expansion                     
              up to the year 2010.  This will also include                                   
              uninterruptible power services and chilled water systems                       
              that will operate the liquefaction facility as well as                         
              clean uninterruptible power and cooling for the operation                      
              of research equipment in the experimental laboratories in                      
              the Department.  This upgrade will enable research programs                    
              dependent on liquid helium to realize their full potential,                    
              and will result in a significant increase in the training                      
              of graduate and undergraduate students in the physical                         
              sciences.
