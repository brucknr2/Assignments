Abstract    :
                   This award is to research, develop and implement a                        
              comprehensive control system for Turning Centers in close                      
              collaboration with an industrial co-sponsor.  This control scheme              
              will be based on reliable process models, the sensing and                      
              processing of multiple process monitoring signals and the                      
              intelligent control of the system in response to limiting factors              
              and disturbances.  Identified areas of research which provide                  
              viable, incremental advances towards the goal of computer                      
              integrated, untended manufacturing will be investigated with                   
              emphasis on the development of intermediate products and solutions.            
                   The proposed work, even though limited to the turning process,            
              is an essential part of the necessary research that will advance               
              the capability and efficiency of manufacturing.  Working in close              
              contact with industry will also allow the transfer of research                 
              efforts in an efficient manner and foster future relationships                 
              between the researcher and industry.
