Abstract    :
              A new class of second order                                                    
              nonlinear optical (NLO) materials                                              
              has been developed:  X(2) ferro-                                               
              electric liquid crystals (FLCs).                                               
              Conventional FLCs readily form low-                                            
              light-loss polar films in a wide                                               
              range of thicknesses, and have been                                            
              demonstrated as optical waveguides.                                            
              The new X(2) FLCs combine the                                                  
              processibility of conventional FLCs                                            
              with thermodynamically stable NLO                                              
              susceptibility of useful magnitude.                                            
              In addition, optical properties such                                           
              as birefringence, dielectric                                                   
              permittivity, and NLO properties are                                           
              highly customizable by chemical
