Abstract    :
              A research program will be undertaken under the Materials Synthesis            
              and Processing Initiative to develop and apply new theoretical and             
              simulational modeling techniques to problems of growth and                     
              deposition of materials.  With the development of high resolution              
              experimental techniques as well as recent advances in our                      
              theoretical understanding of noneqilibrium surface growth                      
              phenomena, it is possible to develop a better understanding of the             
              growth and deposition of materials using theoretical ideas based on            
              continuum models as well as realistic molecular dynamics and Monte             
              Carlo simulations.  In particular, the following projects will be              
              undertaken: order-disorder transition in epitaxial growth; strain              
              relaxation in thin film growth; theoretical models of thin film                
              growth; microscopic modeling of chemical vapor deposition and                  
              growth instabilities; and, modeling the formation of porous                    
              silicon.                                                                       
              %%%                                                                            
              Analytical and computational modeling will be done to understand               
              the deposition of materials onto substrates and their subsequent               
              growth.  This work has an impact on fundamental condensed matter               
              physics and on materials science.  In the latter category it                   
              directly relates to many materials in which thin films play a                  
              critical role such as coatings for corrosion and wear protection;              
              optical coatings; and, microelectronics.  This reserach project is             
              part of the FY92 NSF Materials Synthesis and Processing Initiative.
