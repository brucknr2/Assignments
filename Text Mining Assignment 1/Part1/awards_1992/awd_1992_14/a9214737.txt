Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Anisotropic organic metals manifest unusual magnetic and electronic            
              phenomena particular to electrons constrained in low-dimensional               
              motion.  By now, these effects are mostly well explained by theory.            
              On a finer scale, however, one finds additional strange phenomena              
              that also result from the intrinsic low-d nature of these                      
              materials, especially in the (TMTSF)2X compounds, the first organic            
              superconductors.  These "fine structures" will be the subject of               
              this project.
