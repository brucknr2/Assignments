Abstract    :
              The goal of this research is to create and evaluate a model of                 
              the process by which people locate sounds in three dimensions.                 
              Emphasis will be placed on explaining well established but still               
              incompletely understood psycho-acoustical phenomena.  One example              
              is our ability to locate sounds coming from above or below,                    
              despite the fact that there are no binaural differences between                
              the sounds that reach the ears.  Another example is our ability                
              to locate sounds in reverberant environments that contain                      
              multiple sound sources, where echoes and reflections act as                    
              additional, virtual sources.  A third example is our ability to                
              judge distance, since loudness alone is not an adequate cue.                   
              The model is based on the physical effects of sound propagation,               
              and on neurophysiological studies that have traced the auditory                
              cortex.  It extends an existing computational model of the                     
              cochlea by incorporating monaural and binaural, temporally-based               
              correlation methods to extract the information needed for source               
              localization.  If successful, this work should significantly                   
              improve the abilities of computers to recognize speech or other                
              sounds as they occur in everyday, multisource environments,                    
              thereby extending the range of effective human-machine                         
              interaction.
