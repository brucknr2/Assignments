Abstract    :
                   This award is designed to improve software engineering                    
              education by providing technological support for the                           
              integration of language and design, object modeling                            
              methodology and software libraries of generic components.                      
              Rensselaer will be establishing a Design Conference Room                       
              containing networked workstations, a high-end projection                       
              system, a laser printer, and scanner.  Four courses in the                     
              undergraduate curriculum will be the focus of this project:                    
              the second computer science course, a programming languages                    
              course, a software design course, and a software development                   
              course.                                                                        
                                                                                             
              Rensselaer proposes to develop and integrate into its                          
              curriculum, novel tools and techniques in software design and                  
              implementation.  There are three major themes to this effort:                  
              better design through better use of language during conceptual                 
              stages of design, better design through object modeling and                    
              dynamics, and better software products through the use of                      
              libraries of reliable, reusable software.  The results of the                  
              curriculum and materials development will be disseminated                      
              through publications, and presentations at professional                        
              meetings.
