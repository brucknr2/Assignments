Abstract    :
              9213907    Helgeson    This award will support collaborative research  between
              Harold Helgeson, University of California at  Berkeley, and Mariano Valenza,
              University of  Palermo, Italy.  The proposed research is an effort  to
              understand better the organobiogeochemisty of  geothermal systems and the role
              that bacteria play  in mediating the organic/inorganic interface in 
              geochemical processes.      The research will take place at the hot springs in 
              the Aeolian Islands and at the Marcello Carapezza  Geochemistry Laboratory on
              the island of Vulcano and  the Istituto di Geochimica dei Fluidi in Palermo, 
              Sicily.  The project is an integrated study of the  relation between the
              metabolism of thermobarophilic  bacteria in hot springs, the organic/inorganic 
              chemistry of the thermal waters and fumarolic gases,  and the composition of
              the mineralogic environment  through which they pass.  The Italian research
              team  has intimate familiarity with the geology of the  region, together with
              expertise in sampling and  monitoring, and will provide on-site laboratory 
              facilities.  The US group brings theoretical and  laboratory skills, and
              familiarity with  thermodynamic approaches to studying geothermal  systems.
