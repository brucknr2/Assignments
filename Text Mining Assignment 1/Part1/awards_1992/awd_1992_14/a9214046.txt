Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This is an SGER award to investigate the use of visual programming             
              languages via pen-based computers.  The basic hypothesis to be                 
              tested is the utility of the pen-base programming approach in a                
              human-computer interactive sense as compared with other approaches             
              such as mouse-based visual programming.  Also those aspects of pen-            
              based machines that make them particularly suitable for graphics               
              programming ar investigated.  The approach consists of converting              
              an existing visual programming system to the pen-based environment,            
              moving from an iconic structure to a system capable of accepting               
              hand-drawn diagrams.  Then the two systems are compared for                    
              usability, facility, and general user acceptance.  Collaborative               
              pen-based work is also considered in the process of investigating              
              the visual pen-based programming approach.
