Abstract    :
              This research will investigate a new method of material modeling               
              based on the use of neural networks.  This approach is different               
              from the conventional methods that are based on the construction               
              of relatively simple mathematical models and the use of classical              
              parameter identification techniques.  By contrast, in neural                   
              network modeling the knowledge of the material behavior is                     
              captured directly from observed experimental behavior and is                   
              encoded within the connections of a learning, self-organizing                  
              neural network.
