Abstract    :
              The primary objective of this research project is to                           
              develop and evaluate a fully constrained dynamic                               
              economic dispatch procedure for real and reactive                              
              power with the goal of improving system operation                              
              performance.  A procedure for the fully constrained                            
              dynamic economic dispatch of real and reactive                                 
              power will be developed and evaluated by                                       
              incorporating it into an extended automatic                                    
              generation control simulator that has been                                     
              developed.  The development of a procedure will                                
              include virtually all operating static operating                               
              constraints (including environmental).  The                                    
              incorporation of the procedure into the existing                               
              extended automatic generation control simulator                                
              will result in an enhanced simulator which will serve                          
              as a test bed for the evaluation of the fully                                  
              constrained dynamic economic dispatch procedure.                               
              Evaluation and validation of the methodology will                              
              be conducted using a physical scaled model power                               
              system.
