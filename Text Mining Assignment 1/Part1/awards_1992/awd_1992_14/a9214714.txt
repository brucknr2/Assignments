Abstract    :
                   This project uses local wave diagnostic techniques to study               
              surface manifestations of subsurface magnetic interactions with                
              acoustic waves. The PI used the NSO South Pole observations of                 
              Pomerantz, Harvey, Duvall and Jefferies to develop diagnostic                  
              techniques to detect interactions of acoustic waves with subsurface            
              magnetic structure. These techniques are giving the PI the first               
              detailed look at subphotospheric magnetic structure, showing                   
              submerged flux tubes that cross the solar equator to connect the               
              active region bands. These techniques offer a broad range of                   
              synoptic applications and may revolutionize our understanding of               
              solar interior MHD and the solar dynamo. The techniques will be                
              used to develop an obersvational basis for exploring the solar                 
              interior by means of acoustic holography. The results offer a                  
              unique opportunity to open the solar interior to the field of local            
              helioseismology.
