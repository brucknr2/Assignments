Abstract    :
               Although powerful tools for numerical, statistical, and  algebraic computation
              are readily available and widely used,  a comparable tool for combinatorial
              computing has not yet  emerged.  The lack of such a tool seriously impedes 
              interaction between theory and practice in discrete  mathematics.  Building on
              shared experiences, a  comprehensive software system for combinatorial
              computing  that is efficient, portable, and extensible will be created.  The
              core of the system will be an object-oriented library  containing reusable
              implementations of state-of-the-art  combinatorial algorithms and data
              structures.  To facilitate  experimentation, the workbench will have a powerful
               graphical user interface and a versatile command-interpreter  based on a
              functional programming language.  The tool is to  be built and distributed as a
              self documenting or `Literate`  program.  This new software environment
              facilitates  research in theoretical, experimental, and applied discrete 
              mathematics.
