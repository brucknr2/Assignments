              award funded jointly by the Chemistry Division                                 
              and the International Programs Division will                                   
              support travel for participants from the U.S.                                  
              and regional developing countries in a

              Argentina, April 9-13, 1993.  The organizers                                   
              are Joseph Lambert of Northwestern University                                  
              and Norma Nudelman of the University of Buenos                                 
              Aires.                                                                         
                                                                                             
              The purpose of the workshop is to assess                                       
              priorities of research areas in the field of                                   
              physical organic chemistry and to enhance                                      
              collaboration among US and Latin American                                      
              scientists.  Support will cover travel expenses                                
              for eight US scientists and three developing                                   
              country scientists (from Costa Rica, Uruguay,                                  
              and Colombia).  The workshop will emphasize                                    
              participation from throughout Latin America,                                   
              particularly of younger scientists, for whom                                   
              access to researchers and current information                                  
              in this field is critical.  Expected benefits                                  
              include the establishment of ties for future                                   
              international research collaboration, with                                     
              applications to the chemical industry that will                                
              be both economic and scientific.
