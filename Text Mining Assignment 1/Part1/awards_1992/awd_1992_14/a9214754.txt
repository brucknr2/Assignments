Abstract    :
              In the base isolation mechanisms increased damping is not                      
              necessarily beneficial.  In this project, a damping-independent                
              seismic isolation scheme consisting of a pedestal with multi-                  
              curvature geometry and roller supports will be analytically                    
              examined.  The multi-degree-of-freedom shear building models with              
              this isolation scheme will be utilized in the analytical study to              
              demonstrate its effectiveness.  The isolation effectiveness of                 
              the proposed scheme will be compared with those of the                         
              conventional schemes which use damping in their isolation                      
              devices.
