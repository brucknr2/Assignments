Abstract    :
              Spontaneous mutation rates have been assumed to be constant and                
              uninfluenced by selective forces.  Recent experiments have shown,              
              however, that when stationary cells of Escherichia coli are                    
              subjected to certain non-lethal selections, mutants appear with                
              time.  Because the only mutants that accumulate among the                      
              population are those that are selected for this phenomenon has come            
              to be known as "directed" or "adaptive" mutation.  This phenomenon             
              is not due to obvious artifacts and is under genetic control.  This            
              research will investigate the cellular process that give rise to               
              "directed" mutations.  Using a well-defined mutational assay, the              
              involvement of recombination, DNA synthesis, and various DNA repair            
              pathways will be investigated.  New genetic defects affecting the              
              process will be isolated.  That populations are able to increase               
              their variability under stress without deleterious genetics                    
              consequences has clear evolutionary significance.                              
              %%%                                                                            
              Understanding the mechanism by which this is accomplished may lead             
              to new insights into the regulation of genetic processes and how               
              they may be influenced by the physiology of nutritionally-deprived             
              cells.
