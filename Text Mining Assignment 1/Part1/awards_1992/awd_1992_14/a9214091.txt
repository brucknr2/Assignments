Abstract    :
              This award, made in the Advanced Materials and Processing                      
              Program of the Chemistry Division, is concerned with improving                 
              the quality of films of epitaxially-grown metals, silicon and                  
              germanium by means of kinetic energy-selected neutral beams.                   
              The beams will be produced by pulsed laser vaporization of                     
              solid substrate targets with intermediate deposition on a                      
              transparent window before laser ejection to form the high                      
              kinetic energy beam. Beams will be velocity selected by a high                 
              speed mechanical chopper to obtain well-defined neutral kinetic                
              energies in the range of 1-10 eV. Epitaxial growth of the beams                
              will be probed in situ by low energy ion scattering                            
              spectroscopy, Auger spectroscopy and low energy electron                       
              diffraction. Studies will address the effects of kinetic energy                
              on film quality and growth modes for the low substrate                         
              temperature deposition of metals on silicon single crystals,                   
              the formation of silicides, the homoepitaxy of silicon,  and                   
              the heteroepitaxy of silicon-germanium.                                        
              %%%                                                                            
              Fundamental knowledge of the the mechanism of layer-by layer                   
              growth of metals on refractory substrates will advance the                     
              technology of semiconductor contacts for VSLI microelectronics.
