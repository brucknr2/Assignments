Abstract    :
                   This award will provide one-half the funding needed for the               
              acquisition of a high sensitivity noble gas mass spectrometer to               
              be installed and operated in the Geophysical Institute at the                  
              University of Alaska-Fairbanks. The University is committed to                 
              providing the remaining funds necessary.                                       
                   The mass spectrometer will be used primarily in the                       
              application of the argon-40/argon-39 isotopic method of dating                 
              rocks and minerals in a variety of research projects including the             
              timing of ore-mineralization, dating of Alaskan Quaternary volcanic            
              sequences, the study of very old continental crust evolution, and              
              the study of the retention of argon in minerals.
