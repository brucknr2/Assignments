Abstract    :
                   This award is for the development of a Computer                           
              Productivity Initiative (CPI) that is designed to improve                      
              computer science education by developing a formal laboratory                   
              experience spanning the four year undergraduate program.  CPI                  
              will allow the students to address a specific industrial                       
              problem from the specifications phase through to the                           
              implementation phase.  Old Dominion University will be                         
              producing curriculum support modules, and other educational                    
              material which will be made available to educational                           
              institutions.                                                                  
                                                                                             
              Old Dominion University will be using a Computer Productivity                  
              Initiative to modify its Computer Science curriculum to                        
              provide its students with the knowledge to increase their                      
              productivity in software development.  Over the four year time                 
              period of undergraduate study, computer science students will                  
              address a specific unstructured problem in the context of a                    
              business application.  Existing courses and laboratories at                    
              Old Dominion University will be modified and new ones                          
              developed.  The results of the curriculum and materials                        
              development will be made available to other educational                        
              institutions, and results of the educational experience will                   
              be disseminated in technical and educational journals, and at                  
              presentations at professional meetings.
