Abstract    :
              This award is part of the Arctic System Science (ARCSS) Program,               
              a U.S. Global Change Program.  The research project will develop               
              and provide a hierarchic geographic information system (HGIS) for              
              data storage and manipulation in a collaborative                               
              interdisciplinary research program in the Arctic known as the                  
              ARCSS FLUX Program.  This study will investigate linkages between              
              snow, hydrology, soil processes and biogeochemistry, and                       
              vegetation.  It will include information obtained by researchers               
              studying small plots on the ground and remotely sensed data                    
              obtained from aircraft.  The HGIS capability in conjunction with               
              other modeling technologies and techniques will be used to                     
              evaluate arctic system processes, patterns, and the scaling of                 
              those factors.
