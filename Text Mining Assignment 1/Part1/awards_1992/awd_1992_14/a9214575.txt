Abstract    :
                   Case Western Reserve is commencing a                                      
              renovation project which will modernize 51,000                                 
              gross square feet of space used for research,                                  
              research training and undergraduate education by                               
              the Department of Physics.  In this department                                 
              condensed matter physics and particle/astrophysics                             
              are the primary areas of research with research in                             
              the physics of imaging carried out in collaboration                            
              with the medical school there.  This department                                
              concentrates a great deal of effort on materials                               
              sciences as they study optics, thin film and                                   
              surface physics, and low temperature physics.                                  
              Another significant component of the department's                              
              research involves soft, condensed systems such as                              
              polymers, liquid crystals, and complex fluids, with                            
              a goal of providing a platform for understanding                               
              the fundamental properties of this wide class of                               
              systems.  The renovation of this facility will aid                             
              the Nation in fostering the research and the                                   
              training of students in one of its strategic                                   
              research areas.
