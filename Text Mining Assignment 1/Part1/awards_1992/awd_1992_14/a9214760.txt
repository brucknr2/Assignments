Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This three-year award supports U.S.-France cooperative research                
              in computer vision.  The projects involves U.S. investigators,

              Illinois and French investigators, Nicolas Ayache and Olivier                  
              Faugeras of INRIA (French National Institute for Computer                      
              Science and Applied Mathematics).  The research addresses                      
              vision research concerning geometric reasoning in a three                      
              dimensional environment. Current research in computer vision                   
              has advanced from reasoning in two dimensions to reasoning                     
              about three dimensional objects in the physical world.  The                    
              objective of the research is to simultaneously investigate the                 
              themes of segmentation,  representation of visual information                  
              and matching models with real images and vice versa.                           
                                                                                             
              The collaboration takes advantage of complementary U.S. and                    
              French expertise.  The U.S. investigators have extensive                       
              experience in the computer vision. This is complemented by                     
              French investigators expertise in three-dimensional                            
              representation and their approach utilizing differential geometry              
              of surfaces and variational methods.  Geometric reasoning in a                 
              three dimensional environment will bring computer vision closer                
              to reality.  It has broad applications in many fields such as                  
              navigation, automatic planning, assembly and inspection in                     
              manufacturing.
