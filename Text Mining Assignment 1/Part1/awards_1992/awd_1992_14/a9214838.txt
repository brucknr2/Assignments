Abstract    :
              This award is part of the Arctic System Science (ARCSS) Program,               
              a U.S. Global Change Program.  The research program will focus                 
              existing documentation of the variability of water vapor-related               
              fields over the Arctic on seasonal and longer time scales, to                  
              identify contributions to this variability form sub-portions of                
              the region, and to relate this variability to synoptic activity.               
              Knowledge of the distribution of water vapor over both Arctic                  
              land and ocean areas is needed for improving satellite-derived                 
              estimates of surface energy fluxes, snow depth and extent, and                 
              sea ice conditions.  In terms of climate change, alterations of                
              the flux of atmospheric moisture into the Arctic may influence                 
              Arctic surface radiation budgets through effects on atmospheric                
              emissivity, cloud cover and snowfall.  Associated changes in                   
              precipitation may influence surface runoff, with subsequent                    
              impacts on sea ice production and upper ocean salinities.
