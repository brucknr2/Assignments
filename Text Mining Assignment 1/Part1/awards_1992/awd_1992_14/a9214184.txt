Abstract    :
                   The Museum of Natural History at the                                      
              University of Kansas houses an internationally                                 
              important ethanol research collection of catalogued                            
              specimens of fossil and recent vertebrates.  This                              
              valuable research resource is used by many                                     
              researchers of systematics, biogeography, and                                  
              evolutionary biology for their own research as well                            
              as for training students in these fields.  The                                 
              current facility is not only out dated but the                                 
              space is inadequate and in violation of fire codes.                            
              This award will allow for a replacement facility                               
              which will enable a modern systematic biological                               
              research collection to be a computerized                                       
              information acquisition, storage, and retrieval                                
              system as well as serve the general functions of a                             
              research resource.  This replacement facility will                             
              allow for better research and training of students                             
              concerned with issues related to biodiversity and                              
              ecology.
