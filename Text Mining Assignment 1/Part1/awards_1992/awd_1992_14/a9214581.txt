Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  The PIs propose to add a state-of-the-art 95 GHz (3.2 mm                  
              wavelength) radar to the Facility for Atmospheric Remote Sensing               
              (FARS), which currently includes three polarization lidars and a               
              variety of passive sensors at their permanent structure at the                 
              University of Utah.  This scannable Doppler polarimetric radar will            
              yied the following cloud data quantities:  radar reflectivitryu                
              factors in the V and H planes, and hence linear depolarization                 
              ratios and differential reflectivities, and the measn and variance             
              of radial cloud particle velocityu.  System sensitivity should                 
              permit cloud studies ranging from many fair weather cumulus to high            
              cirrus clouds.  This radar will be integrated into the ongoing                 
              Project FIRE studies of cirrus clouds to enhance the datasets and              
              and provide new insights into cirrus properties using the multiple             
              remote sensor approach, and particularly with regard to the Doppler            
              measurement capabilities.  Measurements of supercooled altocumulus             
              cloud layers will receive special attention, and will serve as                 
              inputs for mixed-phase microphysical, radiative and dynamical                  
              models to help answer basic questions about the growth and                     
              nucleation of these layer clouds.
