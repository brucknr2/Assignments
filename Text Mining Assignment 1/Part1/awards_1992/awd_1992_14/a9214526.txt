Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This award is for the acquisition of infrastructure to support                 
              computational science and engineering with the enhancement of the              
              Scientific Computation Research Center at Rensselaer Polytechnic               
              Institute.  The infrastructure consists of a parallel computer                 
              along with visualization stations, network file systems,                       
              application servers, and high performance desktop servers to                   
              encourage the use of high performance computing and visualization              
              in modern research.  The areas that will especially benefit include            
              Design and Manufacturing, Composite Materials, Integrated                      
              Electronics, Robotics and Automation, Electromagnetics and Energy              
              Systems, Fluid Dynamics, and Groundwater Transport.  The                       
              infrastructure will also be used for graduate training in high                 
              performance computing.
