Abstract    :
              Selective attention is the process whereby a subset of the incoming            
              sensory stream is selected for further processing.  In the case of             
              visual attention, this process can be subdivided into two distinct             
              types of selection.  The first type entails the establishment of a             
              spatial focus, for preferential processing of a single,                        
              circumscribed area of the visual field as needed for object                    
              analysis or recognition.  The second type involves the                         
              establishment of a filter which selectively enhances one or more               
              distinct visual channels across the visual field as a whole, such              
              as to facilitate perception of all stimuli of a specific color,                
              spatial frequency, or direction of motion.  The principal                      
              investigators will study the neurobiological mechanism of selective            
              visual attention, through computer modeling of the correlates of               
              attention at the single cell level and the integration of visual               
              processing and attentional control at the systems level.
