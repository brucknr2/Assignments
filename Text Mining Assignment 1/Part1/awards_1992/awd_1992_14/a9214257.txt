Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This project involves the dissertation research of a cultural                  
              anthropologist in Papua New Guinea.  The student will study how                
              husbands and wives establish authority in communications in                    
              public, private and ritual settings.  By accompanying couples                  
              into the rural forested areas and recording conversations and                  
              speech in various public and private situations the student will               
              document and compare variations in cultural knowledge and analyze              
              how they are used differently by men and women in social                       
              interaction.  The research will use cognitive anthropological                  
              models of analysis to test the hypothesis that women's authority               
              is greatest in private domains.                                                
                                                                                             
              This research is important because it can help us understand the               
              role of gender in interpersonal relations.  By providing a cross               
              cultural comparison to studies done in Western societies, the                  
              study has the potential to advance our theoretical understanding               
              of gender (a current book by Tanner on this subject, drawn from                
              Western society studies, has been on the best seller lists for                 
              weeks).
