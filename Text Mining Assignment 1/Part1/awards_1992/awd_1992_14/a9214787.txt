Abstract    :
              The award will support the Human BrainMap Database:  Workshop I".              
              The support for this workshop spans several Federal Agencies                   
              (Office of Naval Research, National Institute of Mental Health).               
              The workshop will be held in San Antonio, Texas, from November 29              
              through December 2, 1992.  The workshop will focus on  issues of               
              functional brain mapping (identifying the locations and                        
              computational properties of the neural populations that orchestrate            
              human behavior) via positron emission tomography.  In particular,              
              issues of database design, standards, interfaces with computer                 
              software as well as data sharing and intellectual property will be             
              discussed.  This activity follows recommendations set out by the               
              Institute of Medicine report: Mapping the Brain.  It is anticipated            
              that this will be the first of two workshops, with an intervening              
              period of testing of specific software, BrainMap.
