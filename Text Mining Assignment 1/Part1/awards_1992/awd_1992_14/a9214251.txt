Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Technical Narrative:                                                           
                                                                                             
              This U.S.-Turkey collaborative research project involving civil                
              engineers from Texas Tech University and Middle East Technical                 
              University (METU) in Ankara, Turkey will develop a simplified model            
              for the dynamic behavior of window glass panels during an                      
              artificially simulated earthquake. Project funding will enable Dr.             
              Haluk Sucuoglu of METU to participate in a data collection survey              
              on the behavior of window glass panels during earthquakes in both              
              the U.S. and Europe, especially Turkey; he will then spend three               
              months in the laboratory of Dr. C.V.G. Vallabhan at Texas Tech                 
              University jointly interpreting the survey data and developing the             
              mathematical model.  The research will continue when Dr. Sucuoglu              
              returns to METU; Dr. Vallabhan will travel to METU and spend one               
              month with Dr. Sucuoglu to complete the project.  This project is              
              important because understanding and predicting the dynamic load                
              properties of window glass panels during earthquakes has widespread            
              implications for construction planning and safety.                             
                                                                                             
              This project in structural systems and construction processes                  
              fulfills the program objective in advancing scientific knowledge by            
              enabling leading experts in the United States and Turkey to combine            
              complementary talents and pool research resources in areas of                  
              strong mutual interest and competence.
