Abstract    :
              This award provides funds to the Pittsburgh Supercomputer                      
              Center (PSC) to aid in the purchase of a massively parallel                    
              computer (Cray T3D).  The purchase is part of a project that                   
              includes operations and systems support of benefit to                          
              biological researchers around the country via network access                   
              to the PSC.                                                                    
                                                                                             
              In recent years, efforts to improve the speed of the largest                   
              and fastest general purpose computers has focused on the use                   
              of so-called "massively parallel" architectures.  In these                     
              computers, a very large number of processors are                               
              interconnected so that complex calculations can be broken                      
              into a number of component problems that are solved                            
              separately and simultaneously by the processors.  The                          
              earliest computers of this type employed very large numbers                    
              of the relatively slow processors typical of personal                          
              computers.  The  most recent designs,  such as the T3D, use                    
              a smaller (but still large) number of the very powerful                        
              processors typically found in advanced scientific                              
              workstations.  Although the use of parallel computers for                      
              analysis of computationally intensive problems in biology is                   
              still in its infancy,  many of these problems are well-                        
              suited to "parallelization"; the availability of this                          
              computer to all researchers through the auspices of the PSC                    
              is expected to have a significant impact on understanding of                   
              biological problems as diverse as the structures of                            
              individual proteins and the function of the nervous system.
