Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Technical Narrative:                                                           
                                                                                             
              This U.S.-Turkey collaborative research project involving a                    
              cultural anthropologist from University of California at Davis and             
              an agricultural economist from Ege University in Boronova, Turkey              
              will provide a comprehensive study of the biological diversity of              
              wheat in Turkey.  Project funding will enable Dr. Emin Isikli of               
              Ege University to participate in a survey of wheat farmers in                  
              Turkey and then spend six months in the laboratory of Dr. Stephen              
              Brush at UC Davis analyzing and interpreting the survey data.  This            
              collaborative research project will study how farmers use different            
              types of wheat, relate the variation in use to socioeconomic and               
              environmental variation, and establish conservation procedures to              
              maintain the diversity that exists.  This project is important                 
              because understanding why farmers maintain diverse crop types will             
              aid in designing policies to encourage diversity, thereby,                     
              conserving the genetic substance of diverse plants for the future.             
                                                                                             
              This project in biological diversity fulfills the program objective            
              of advancing scientific knowledge by enabling leading experts in               
              the United States and Turkey to combine complementary talents and              
              pool research resources in areas of strong mutual interest and                 
              competence.
