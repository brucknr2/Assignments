Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Model systems are used to understand how the nervous system                    
              controls behavior.  In this award, Dr. Roye will investigate the               
              sensory and motor integration of a withdrawal behavior in an                   
              invertebrate.  Identification of the motor nerve cells, the sensory            
              nerve cells and the interneurons which interconnect the motor and              
              sensory cells will lead to a greater understanding of the                      
              functional aspects of this behavior.  Much of the research will be             
              performed by undergraduates, who will make significant                         
              contributions to all aspects of the project and gain valuable                  
              experience in scientific research.  The results obtained from this             
              work on the form and function of the neural networks responsible               
              for withdrawal behavior in an invertebrate model system will                   
              provide insight into the organization of neural networks that                  
              produce the more complex behaviors seen in organisms at higher                 
              levels of the phylogenetic scale.
