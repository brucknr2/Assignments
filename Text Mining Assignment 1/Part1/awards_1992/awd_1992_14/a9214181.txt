Abstract    :
                   This award to Clark University is for                                     
              renovation and reconfiguration of chemistry                                    
              research laboratories, with particular emphasis on                             
              improving the fume hoods and HVAC system.  The                                 
              project continues their recent efforts to build a                              
              modern facility, support research and research                                 
              training, and provide means to meet their science                              
              equipment needs into the next century for their                                
              small, quality doctoral chemistry research program                             
              which has just received a $400,000 grant from the                              
              U.S. Department of Education to assist it to                                   
              expand its graduate student numbers by 50%, with                               
              particular attention to the recruitment of women                               
              and minorities.                                                                
                   The project includes complete removal and                                 
              replacement of the fume hoods and associated duct                              
              work in Jeppson Laboratory; renovation of the HVAC                             
              system to accommodate the new air flows; and                                   
              upgrades and reconfiguration of several research                               
              laboratories to adapt them to the current needs of                             
              the chemistry faculty and accommodate the                                      
              increased number of research students.  The                                    
              laboratory renovations, although minor in scope,                               
              will greatly enhance productivity and safety, and                              
              will allow the full utilization of existing space                              
              that will be required to accommodate the increased                             
              numbers of researchers associated with the Ph.D.                               
              program expansion.
