Abstract    :
                   Carnegie Mellon University is renovating 6000                             
              square feet of laboratory space to be used by                                  
              researchers in the area of environmental sciences.                             
              Research which is currently performed in this                                  
              department if funded by federal agencies, private                              
              companies and foundations and includes topics on                               
              water quality, air quality, and solid waste                                    
              disposal.  The environmental sciences research labs                            
              are in a state of disrepair and are inadequate to                              
              meet the needs of the researchers.  The renovated                              
              space will allow the researchers to work closer                                
              together in a modernized facility which will                                   
              attract studnets into this important area of                                   
              science.  Finally, this facility renovation will                               
              foster research in a strategic research area for                               
              the Nation, environmental science.
