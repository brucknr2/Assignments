Abstract    :
                   The objective of this Research Planning Grant is to obtain                
              precise, steady-state estimates of the variance of the sample                  
              mean from simulation output data.  A new inference technique is                
              proposed for estimating the variance by augmenting existing                    
              estimators and their performance.  The research effort includes                
              theoretical development of the techniques and empirical studies                
              in comparison with other estimators to benchmark performance.                  
                   The long-term goal of the required follow-up study is the                 
              design of an automatic run length control system for steady state              
              simulation studies.  This research is anticipated to make                      
              theoretical and practical contributions to the knowledge base of               
              computer simulation experiment analysis.
