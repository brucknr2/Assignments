Abstract    :
              9214905  Kron    This three-year award will support U.S.-Italy cooperative 
              research between Richard Kron, University of Chicago, and Dario  Trevese of the
              University of Rome, "La Sapienza," Italy, on the  optical variability of
              quasars.  This is a topic in quasar  research that is central to the
              understanding of the power  source.    The research collaboration will measure
              the optical variability  of a statistical sample of quasars based on archival
              data that  span 15 years.  Kron and Trevese will complete a detailed 
              statistical analysis of the quasar light curves, and will observe 
              spectroscopically a sample of galaxies selected on the basis of  their nuclear
              variability, which will allow the study of the  continuity between quasars and
              galaxies with active nuclei, thus  constraining models for the cosmological
              evolution of quasars.      Thorough research on the variability of quasars will
              contribute  to our understanding of the mechanism by which quasars attain 
              their enormous luminosity by the infall of material into a black  hole.  This
              work may lead to alternative ways of searching for  quasars, through their
              variability, which has until now been only  partially successful.  * * *
