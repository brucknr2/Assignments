Abstract    :
              A theoretical study will be carried out on various phenomena in                
              superfluid helium-three in which the liquid is thrown violently out            
              of thermal equilibrium and must then recover.  In particular, in               
              light of the recent discovery of Osheroff and Schiffer that a gamma            
              ray scource is an efficient nucleator of the first order A to B                
              transition, it is planned to elaborate the "baked Alaska" mechanism            
              for nucleation of this transition by high energy electrons which               
              was suggested earlier and to make detailed predictions of the                  
              dependence of the nucleation rate on temperature and on magnetic               
              field.  In addition, studies are planned of the nuclear magnetic               
              resonance behavior in the highly supercooled A phase in low field,             
              with a view to obtaining previously unavailable microscopic                    
              parameters of the liquid.  It is also proposed to develop further              
              a collective model of amorphous materials for explaining the                   
              remarkable quantitative universlaity of the thermal and acoustic               
              properties of these materials at low temperatures.

              Theoretical research will be conducted in two areas for which the              
              Principal Investigator is the world leader: (1) research will                  
              continue on models for amorphous materials to explain the common               
              properties that occur at very low temperatures among diverse                   
              materials; (2) work will continue on models for the violent                    
              behavior of helium at very low temperatures.  This behavior has                
              recently been observed and a theory, introduced earlier, will be               
              further developed in light of these recent and exciting                        
              experimental discoveries.
