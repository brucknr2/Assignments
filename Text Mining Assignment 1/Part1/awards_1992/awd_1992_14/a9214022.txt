Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Several metal-containing polymer blends which form coordination                
              complexes are the focus of this investigation.  The model compounds            
              are low-molecular-weight salts in which the divalent metal centers             
              range from iron to copper in the first row of the d-block, and                 
              ruthenium to silver in the second row.  The ligand is poly(4-                  
              vinylpyridine) or copolymers that contain 4-vinylpyridine repeat               
              units.  Thermal analysis via differential scanning calorimetry and             
              polarized optical microscopy will be employed to generate                      
              thermodynamic phase diagrams of these binary mixtures.  At the                 
              molecular level, high-resolution carbon-13 solid-state nuclear                 
              magnetic resonance and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopies               
              will be used to probe microenvironmental factors that influence                
              mixing.  Natural abundance nitrogen-15 solid-state nuclear magnetic            
              resonance experiments in oversized rotors will provide a direct                
              probe of metal-ligand sigma-bonding that involves the lone pair on             
              nitrogen.                                                                      
                                                                                             
              The proposed enhancement of miscibility via coordination-type                  
              interactions brought about by metal ions is important because most             
              polymer mixtures are not miscible, which limits their usefulness.              
              Any improvement would lead to new structural materials.
