                   This award provides partial support for the fourth annual                 
              SUNYA Topology and Group Theory conference, October 16-18, 1992.               
              The conference concentrates on combinatorial group theory and low              
              dimensional topology.  The invited speakers are Martin Bridson,                
              Andrew Casson, Marshall Cohen, Martin Dunwoody, Louis Kauffman,                
              Steven Pride, and Richard Skora.
