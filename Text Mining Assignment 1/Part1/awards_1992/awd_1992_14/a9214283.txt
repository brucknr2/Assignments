Abstract    :
                   This award will provide funding for the                                   
              renovation of a portion of the research space of                               
              the Department of Geology of the University of                                 
              Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.  Funding of this                                 
              renovation will provide substantially improved                                 
              facilities for an active group of faculty who have                             
              shown the capacity to effectively use available                                
              resources.  The space is located in the Natural                                
              History Building, which was built in 1892.  Most                               
              of the space has not been significantly renovated                              
              since the 1950's or early 1960's and is presently                              
              unsuited for modern research purposes.                                         
                   The space to be renovated is devoted almost                               
              entirely to research and associated research                                   
              training.  It includes laboratories for                                        
              sedimentary petrology, paleontology, stable                                    
              isotope geochemistry, radiogenic isotope and trace                             
              element geochemistry, engineering geology,                                     
              experimental mineralogy and petrology, and rock                                
              sample preparation.  Renovation of this space will                             
              provide 10 of the 19 faculty members of the                                    
              Department with new or substantially improved                                  
              research facilities and will significantly                                     
              increase their research capacity.
