Abstract    :
                   Research in pion physics and weak interactions will be                    
              carried out at LAMPF and at PSI.  The LAMPF work will measure                  
              the pion-pion scattering length to test various QCD inspired                   
              theories of the strong interaction.  The method used involves                  
              threshold pion production in pion-proton scattering.  New data                 
              will be taken at LAMPF, and combined with a global phase shift                 
              analysis fit to all higher energy data.  The PSI experiment is                 
              a measurement of the charged pion beta decay to a neutral                      
              pion.  A new cesium iodide calorimeter and wire chamber                        
              tracking array is required for this purpose.  A collaboration                  
              has been formed to build this detector.  The experiment will                   
              determine elements of the fundamental mixing matrix which                      
              relates transitions between different quark generations.  New                  
              constraints will be placed on the standard model of                            
              fundamental interactions.
