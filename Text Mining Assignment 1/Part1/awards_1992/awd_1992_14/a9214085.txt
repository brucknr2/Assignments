Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This Americas Program award will support                                       
              continuation of a long-term collaborative study                                
              between Dr. Peter Feinsinger, Northern Arizona                                 
              University, and Dr. Fabian M. Jaksic,                                          
              Universidad Catolica de Chile.  The                                            
              researcher's previous work has shown that small                                
              mammal population varies greatly from year to                                  
              year whereas the abundance of large insects and                                
              other foods appear to be seasonally determined.                                
              The primary objective of this research is to                                   
              study the responses of predator assemblages to                                 
              this complex pattern of local variation in prey                                
              densities.  Based on the nature of long-term                                   
              variation in the predators' use of different                                   
              habitat patches over the landscape, the                                        
              researchers will propose landscape-level                                       
              conservation plans that will serve to buffer                                   
              these predators from future local shortages in                                 
              their prey.                                                                    
                                                                                             
              This study is likely to yield significant                                      
              contributions to our knowledge of neotropical                                  
              guild structure and provide guidelines for the                                 
              design of refuges and preserves that will                                      
              maintain populations of wide-ranging                                           
              carnivores.  This is an excellent collaboration                                
              in which the areas of expertise of the                                         
              researchers complement each other.
