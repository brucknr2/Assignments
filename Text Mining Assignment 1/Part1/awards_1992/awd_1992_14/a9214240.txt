Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This Science in Developing Countries award will                                
              support a workshop in the Dominican Republic to                                
              compare the geology of island arc terranes in                                  
              central and northern Hispaniola, eastern Cuba,                                 
              Jamaica and the eastern Cayman Trough.  The large                              
              separations of the various crustal blocks/terranes                             
              in this boundary zone are poorly known, making it                              
              difficult to reconstruct the Late Paleogene                                    
              configuration of the early arc.  An important aspect                           
              of the workshop will be to actually examine the                                
              tectonostratigraphic units in the central and                                  
              northern Dominican Republic to see if a correlation                            
              can be made with similar units in the Oriente area                             
              of Cuba and in Jamaica. If the earlier rocks can be                            
              correlated this will help to understand the                                    
              magnitude and timing of terrane movements in the                               
              zone.                                                                          
                                                                                             
              This workshop, organized by Dr. Grenville Draper of                            
              Florida International University, will bring                                   
              together geologists working in Hispaniola, Jamaica,                            
              Puerto Rico and eastern Cuba to examine and compare                            
              the rocks in these areas.  The workshop will focus                             
              attention on important tectonic problems and lead to                           
              better planning of a detailed joint project to be                              
              carried out in the future. ***
