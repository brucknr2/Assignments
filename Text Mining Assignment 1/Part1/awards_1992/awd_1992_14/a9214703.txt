Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This project will develop and use low-cost, long-duration balloon              
              systems to make measurement within the Arctic polar stratospheric              
              vortex to study ozone depletion issues. The balloon borne                      
              instruments will measure polar stratospheric clouds using the                  
              backscattersondes developed by the principal investigator, ozone,              
              temperature and eventually nitric acid, aerosols, water vapor,                 
              nitrogen dioxide and other trace gasses which are important to                 
              ozone depletion.                                                               
                                                                                             
              This project is a joint venture of the University of Wyoming and               
              the Central Aerological Obsevatory, Moscow, Russia.  The Russian               
              involvement is necessary to obtain permission for the balloons to              
              traverse Russian airspace, to help with tracking and to facilitate             
              payload recovery.                                                              
                                                                                             
              This project is jointly funded by the Division Of Polar Programs               
              and the Division of International Programs.
