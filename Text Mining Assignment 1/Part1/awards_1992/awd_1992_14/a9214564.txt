Abstract    :
                   The Department of Chemistry requests funds                                
              for the renovation of three research laboratory                                
              modules and a mechanical room.  The University                                 
              committed $3.2 million to begin a total                                        
              renovation.  Having completed the initial stage of                             
              the project, this proposal focuses on the final                                
              three research modules to be renovated.  The three                             
              labs are in a poor state of repair.  None has fume                             
              hood capabilities because the original air-                                    
              handling system is imcompatable with the new                                   
              system.  The third module is unsuitable for an x-                              
              ray and solid state lab.  All four faculty members                             
              are active participants in research built around                               
              the involvement of both.                                                       
                   The research effort is not limited to the                                 
              graduate level. Over the last five years, 34                                   
              undergraduates have appeared as co-authors on                                  
              research publications and 50 have appeared as co-                              
              authors on research presentations at professional                              
              meetings.  The Department is one of NSF's REU                                  
              sites and in the last four years the Department                                
              has graduated two NSF Predoctoral Fellows, two ACS                             
              Organic Division Fellows, a Rhodes Scholar and a                               
              Rhodes Finalist.
