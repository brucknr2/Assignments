Abstract    :

              crystallization rates for crystalline polymers will be investigated            
              for their sensitivity to flow-induced effects.  The primary interest           
              is in the effect of shear.  The study will explore the relationship            
              between shear stress, shear rate, viscosity, and crystallization               
              rate as a function of temperature for several polymers.  The                   
              approach is experimental and also by way of modeling.  The injection           
              molding process will be modeled and the results compared to                    
              experimental findings.                                                         
                                                                                             
              Crystalline polymers, and the injection molding process, are                   
              important elements in the polymer manufacturing industry.  This                
              research will add to the capability to control product and process             
              with greater accuracy and confidence.
