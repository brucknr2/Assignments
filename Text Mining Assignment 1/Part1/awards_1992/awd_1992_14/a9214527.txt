Abstract    :
                   The renovation and modernization program                                  
              awarded will upgrade laboratory facilities and                                 
              research instrumentation in the interconnected                                 
              third-floor areas of 1960's vintage Klamath Hall                               
              and Onyx Bridge, within the Department of                                      
              Chemistry at the University of Oregon.  These                                  
              areas are occupied by the advanced chemical                                    
              research groups of a highly interactive group of                               
              organic, inorganic, materials, biological                                      
              chemists, organized as an interdisciplinary                                    
              program in Molecular Synthesis, Structure, and                                 
              Dynamics (MSSD).  The project will: (1) renovate                               
              ca. 5,200 square feet of laboratory facilities in                              
              Onyx Bridge that have grown inadequate  and unsafe                             
              for modern synthetic chemistry; (2) renovate ca.                               
              2,300 square feet of space in the core area of                                 
              Klamath Hall for consolidation of major existing                               
              instrumentation into a monitored shared                                        
              instrumentation facility; (3) enable the MSSD                                  
              program to add substantially to its pool of                                    
              undergraduate, graduate, and postdoctoral research                             
              students by providing suitable laboratories for                                
              them; and (4) upgrade shared instrumentation and                               
              equipment in these facilities to modern                                        
              specifications and standards for current and                                   
              future chemical research.
