Abstract    :
                   Oberlin College requests funds for partial                                
              renovation of the Wright Laboratory of Physics.                                
                   The renovation will include the installation                              
              of a new heating, ventilation and air-conditioning                             
              system and modern ancillary laboratory services,                               
              including deionized water, domestic water,                                     
              chemical sinks and drains, fume hoods, modern                                  
              electric power, and a closed-loop cooling system.                              
              Interior walls and ceilings will be shielded                                   
              against radio-frequency interference and relocated                             
              to create appropriately-sized rooms.  The                                      
              renovated facility will contain a Wet Chemistry                                
              Lab capable of supporting limited                                              
              photolithography.                                                              
                   The renovation will improve the quality and                               
              scope of faculty research, enhance the ability of                              
              the department to attract women and minority                                   
              faculty members, allow the reinstatement of                                    
              projects that have recently been abandoned,                                    
              increase the number of opportunities for students                              
              to participate in research, and improve the                                    
              intermediate and advanced laboratory courses,                                  
              which are dependent on high-quality HVAC, wet                                  
              chemical facilities and electrical environment.
