Abstract    :
              This grant from the Organic Dynamics Program supports the work                 
              of Professor James E. Johnson at Texas Woman's University.  The                
              role of stereoelectronic effects in nucleophilic substitution                  
              reactions at the carbon-nitrogen double bond will be explored.                 
              Geometric isomers of imines will be synthesized, the rates of                  
              their reactions with oxygen and nitrogen nucleophiles will be                  
              measured, and the structures of the products will be                           
              determined.  The specific studies that will be undertaken                      
              include: (1) nucleophilic substitution on cyclic hydroximates                  
              and hydroximoyl chlorides; (2) methoxide ion substitution on                   
              the Z and E isomers of n-propyl O-methylethoxy                                 
              formohydroximate; (3) amine substitution in the Z and E isomers                
              of hydroximoyl chlorides, and (4) hydrolysis of the Z and E                    
              isomers of a hydroximoyl tosylate and/or a hydroximoyl bromide.

              The rates of reaction of several substrates that different in                  
              the arrangement of their atoms in space will be measured.                      
              Differences in reactivity and in the structures of the products                
              will allow assessment of the effect of nonbonding electrons on                 
              the course of the reaction.  The results of this study will                    
              contribute to an improved understanding of reactions of organic                
              compounds which contain nitrogen atoms.
