Abstract    :
                   The funding will be used to completely                                    
              modernize the core molecular biology/cytogenetics                              
              research facilities, upgrade central autoclave and                             
              water purification capabilities, provide                                       
              reasonable amounts of personal laboratory space                                
              for the two newest faculty members, and                                        
              significantly increase individual bench space,                                 
              which is crucial for student research.  These                                  
              renovations will provide for research projects in                              
              cytogenetics, molecular evolution and systematics,                             
              plant growth and development, and studies or                                   
              morphegenesis.  These renovations will serve as a                              
              foundation for further development of a research-                              
              active Department.                                                             
                   The improved working environment,                                         
              modernization, will increase the opportunities for                             
              faculty members to obtain extramural funding and,                              
              thus, have an additional positive impact on                                    
              opportunities for student research.  Hofstra                                   
              University is committed to providing opportunities                             
              for the less physically able student and for                                   
              attracting members of underrepresented groups into                             
              scholarly research.  The University has an                                     
              excellent record of providing opportunities to                                 
              minority students through special programs.
