Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This award supports U.S.-U.K. cooperative research in cell                     
              biology.  The investigators are Dominick and Margaret Basile of                
              Lehman College, City University of New York, and Keith                         
              Roberts of the John Innes Institute, Norwich, United Kingdom.                  
              The research focuses on Arabinogalactan proteins (AGPs), which                 
              are cell-surface glycoproteins, and their role in cell proliferation.          
              AGPs are associated with numerous functions in the plasma                      
              membranes and extracellular matrix in plants.  Through the                     
              development of monoclonal antibodies, the investigators propose                
              to identify AGPs associated with the suppression and                           
              desupression of cell proliferation in plants.  Once the AGPs                   
              associated with cell proliferation are isolated, they can be                   
              characterized and their genetic regulation and mechanism can be                
              better investigated.                                                           
                                                                                             
              The U.S. investigators bring to this collaboration their work on               
              morphoregulation in liverworts and their recent findings on the                
              involvement of AGPs in plant development.  This is                             
              complemented by the British investigator's expertise in producing              
              monoclonal antibodies and his skill in immunocytochemical                      
              localization of AGPs. Their combined efforts will advance our                  
              understanding of the growth processes in the development of                    
              multicellular organisms and in the function of AGPs in regulating              
              cell proliferation.
