Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  The PIs will participate in the development of a new D-region             
              measurement for an existing, multipurpose radar system.  This                  
              research instrumentation, called the frequency-agile radar (FAR),              
              is a recently developed system designed to operate in a number of              
              diagnostic modes.  The new capability consists of a means to obtain            
              frequency-agile measurements of backscatter from the D-region.                 
              Frequency-agile backscatter measurements will enable the PIs to                
              characterize (for the first time) the turbulence spectrum and its              
              evolution as a function of time.                                               
                                                                                             
                   For this, SRI will develop a high-power, frequency-agile                  
              capability for the FAR in the frequency range of 2 to 30 MHz.  With            
              other components to be purchased, the PIs will participate in a                
              number of new research areas.
