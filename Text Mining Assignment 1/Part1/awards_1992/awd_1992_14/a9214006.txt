Abstract    :
              This award supports Professor Robert B. Gennis and a graduate                  
              student of the University of Illinois to collaborate in biochemistry           
              research with Professor Marten Wikstrom and his research group at              
              the Department of Medicinal Chemistry of the University of Helsinki,           
              Finland.  The primary objective of their research is to characterize           
              the structural and functional details of the predominant membrane-             
              bound enzyme in Escherichia coli which catalyzes the oxidation of              
              ubiquinol and the reduction of molecular oxygen to water.  This                
              electron transfer reaction is coupled to the net translocation of              
              protons across the cell membrane.  The research plan involves a                
              synergistic combination of molecular genetics expertise in the U.S.            
              group and biophysical and spectroscopic expertise in the group in              
              Finland.                                                                       
                                                                                             
              The type of oxidases being studied by these scientists are a major             
              family of enzymes directly involved in biological energy                       
              transduction.  The proposed research should provide the experimental           
              basis for understanding the architecture of these enzymes and the              
              molecular basis of proton translocation.
