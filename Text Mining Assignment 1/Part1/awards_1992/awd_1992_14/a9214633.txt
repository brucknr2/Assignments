Abstract    :
                   The University of Tennessee requests funds to                             
              renovate existing research space assigned to the                               
              Department of Physiology and Biophysics.  The                                  
              renovation intends to modernize two existing                                   
              research labs, create two additional labs and                                  
              develop multi-user areas for class B tissue                                    
              culture, data processing, molecular biology, and                               
              image analysis.  The facilities at the Nash                                    
              Building date from 1952 (40 years).                                            
                   The proposed space renovation will:  1)                                   
              enhance the established departmental research                                  
              programs; 2) increase the training opportunities                               
              for predoctoral and postdoctoral fellows; 3)                                   
              increase the research activity for faculty and                                 
              studnets from LeMoyne-Owen College and Fisk                                    
              University, historically black liberal arts                                    
              schools; and 4) augment the educational activities                             
              for minority high school and undergraduate students                            
              in the program entitled "Advancing Science                                     
              Education through Research for Underrepresented                                
              Groups."
