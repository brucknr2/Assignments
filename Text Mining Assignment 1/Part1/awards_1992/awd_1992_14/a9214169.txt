Abstract    :
                   This proposal requests funding for the                                    
              renovation of some thirty research laboratories and                            
              twelve research instruction areas.  Renovation is                              
              to include replastering, repainting, reflooring,                               
              receiling, changing interior walls, refurbishing                               
              and equipping research areas with tables, cabinets,                            
              benches, sinks, fume hoods, distilled water, gas,                              
              electrical outlets, compressed air, etc.                                       
              Additionally, instrumentation, such as fume hoods,                             
              support vital to a growing research area in                                    
              cellular and molecular biology is requested.  The                              
              local impact will be great and will make a strong                              
              statement designation as a Commonwealth of Kentucky                            
              Center of Excellence for Reservoir Research the                                
              local impact can and should generate national                                  
              interest.                                                                      
                   One goal for the College is to become                                     
              nationally, even internationally recognized for                                
              excellence in reservoir ecology.  A parallel goal                              
              is to develop a strong cellular and molecular                                  
              biology program.
