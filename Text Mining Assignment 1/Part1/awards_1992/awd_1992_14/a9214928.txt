Abstract    :
              The Engineering Foundation's Conference is an                                  
              international meeting cosponsored by the                                       
              Engineering Foundation and NATO, to be held in                                 
              Ventura, California, August 16-21, 1992.  The                                  
              conference will have about 50 invited speakers from                            
              the USA, Europe and Japan.  The topics to be                                   
              featured at the meeting will include: Materials                                
              modification and manipulation by STM/AFM,                                      
              Nanolithography, Physical and chemical properties                              
              of nanostructures and clusters, Transport properties                           
              of nanostructures, Nanoelectronics, and Molecular                              
              devices and molecular electronics. The conference                              
              will  serve as a forum for an interdisciplinary                                
              exchange of knowledge and ideas.  The aim is to                                
              accelerate the optimization and modification                                   
              techniques, to help delineate the fundamental                                  
              mechanisms involved, to lead to a better                                       
              understanding of the physical, chemical, and                                   
              electrical properties of nanostructures, and to point                          
              to novel applications.  The conference proceedings                             
              will be published in the NATO Advanced Studies                                 
              Institute series by Kluwer Publishers.  The object of                          
              this proposal is to provide funds for travel support                           
              of graduate students.
