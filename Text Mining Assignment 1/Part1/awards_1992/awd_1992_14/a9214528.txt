Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This award is for funding to upgrade the infrastructure of Westnet,            
              a regional computer network in the West connecting together                    
              Universities, High Schools, and research institutions.  The network            
              serves many communities including isolated Hispanic and Native                 
              American communities.  The upgrade is to improve the routers at                
              major sites of the network to improve speed and throughput.                    
                                                                                             
              The upgrade to the network will improve access for both researchers            
              and educators.  The research projects that are accessible through              
              Westnet range from weather modeling to high performance computing              
              to remote telescope operation.
