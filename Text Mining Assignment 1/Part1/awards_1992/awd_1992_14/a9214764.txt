                                         ABSTRACT                                            
                                                                                             
                                                                                            
              This dissertation research project is a cross-linguistic and                   
              cross-model study comparing the natural gestural-visual languages              
              of the deaf and the oral languages within which these sign                     
              languages are found for the purpose of investigating questions                 
              about linguistic universals and human cognition in general, as                 
              well as language contact phenomena, particularly with respect to               
              rhetorical practices and communicative conventions.  The research              
              focuses on American Sign Language (ASL) and American English,                  
              Brazilian Cities Sign Language (BCSL), a language of the urban                 
              Brazilian deaf, and Brazilian Portuguese, and Urubu-Kaapor Sign                
              Language (UKSL) and Kaapor, these latter two being languages of                
              an American Indian group native to the Amazonian region of                     
              Brazil.  Comparative work of this kind can provide crucial                     
              evidence for distinguishing constraints imposed by the                         
              communication medium, both vocal-auditory and gestural-visual,                 
              from linguistic universals.  Scholars have tended to approach the              
              analysis of empirical linguistic data as if there were a binary                
              division between universality and relativity, without taking into              
              account the impact of communicative modality.  The inclusion of                
              sign language data is crucial not only to the universality versus              
              relativity debate but also to the understanding of human                       
              cognition to the extent that such understanding relies on                      
              linguistic evidence.
