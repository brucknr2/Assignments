Abstract    :
                   The Center for Environmental Research and                                 
              Education at the State University of New York at                               
              Buffalo was established to coordinate and enhance                              
              ongoing research and education activities concerned                            
              with environmental problems of the Great Lakes                                 
              Basin.  Some of the activities of this center                                  
              include basic and applied research, educational                                
              training in environmental science, and developing                              
              collaborative interactions between the Center and                              
              local, state and federal governmental agencies as                              
              well as industrial corporations and community                                  
              groups concerned with environmental issues.                                    
                   This award allows the Center to renovate over                             
              5000 gross square feet to be used by researchers                               
              and students of the environmental sciences,                                    
              focusing on issues like chemical contamination,                                
              toxic effects of anthropogenic organic chemical                                
              contamination on ecosystems and humans, and water                              
              ecology and pollutant effect on fish and wildlife.                             
              Finally, this renovation project fosters basic                                 
              research and training in one of the Nation's                                   
              strategic research areas, environmental science.
