Abstract    :
                   This award makes it possible for the                                      
              University of Alabama birmingham to renovate their                             
              Chemistry Department in order to improve their                                 
              research space and to involve more graduate and                                
              undergraduate students in their research.  This                                
              university had initiated cross-disciplinary                                    
              research in a number of areas, single crystal                                  
              protein growth and designer drug research is one                               
              example.  However, they are also linking materials                             
              science and engineering, biomedical engineering,                               
              physics, chemistry, mathematics and computer and                               
              information science in research areas which focus                              
              on polymer synthesis and evaluation, molecular                                 
              biophysics and computational chemistry.                                        
                   Many of their research efforts are getting                                
              direct support from industrial participants and                                
              this is allowing them to make their most valuable                              
              products, their students, keep in tune with the                                
              needs of the industrial sector.  This renovation                               
              project encourages progress in one of the Nation's                             
              strategic research areas, materials science.
