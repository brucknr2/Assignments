Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The objectives of this research are to synthesize new organic-                 
              inorganic layered structured with adsorption sites for specific                
              organic molecules and to investigate the synthesis of new extended             
              lattices based on connected frameworks of VO5 square pyramids with             
              tetrahedral oxyanions.  Subsequent removal of the guest species                
              from the solid leads to compounds which can show highly selective              
              molecular sorption and ion complexation in subsequent reactions.               
              The new phases will be characterized by powder and single crystal              
              diffraction methods, magnetic susceptibility measurements and the              
              determination of sorption isotherms and kinetics.  These studies               
              are of special value in catalysis for processes involving the                  
              production of fuels and chemicals.
