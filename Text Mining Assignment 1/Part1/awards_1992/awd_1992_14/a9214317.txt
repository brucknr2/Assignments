Abstract    :
                   Instrumentation will be provided by this grant that will                  
              establish a tunable CW laser facility in the Physics                           
              Department at the University of Washington.  This will make                    
              possible new range of precision experiments in atomic physics                  
              using the trapping of single atoms to establish more stable                    
              time and frequency standards, as well as new tests of atomic                   
              parity and time reversal symmetry violation.  In addition,                     
              this new facility will aid in the study of condensed matter                    
              interfaces and heterostructures.  The facility will provide cw                 
              laser operation from the ultraviolet region through the near                   
              infrared.
