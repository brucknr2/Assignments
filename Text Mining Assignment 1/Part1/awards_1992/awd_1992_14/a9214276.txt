Abstract    :
              This subsidy will allow publication of four volumes of Systematic              
              Botany Monographs.  The research for these monographs in plant                 
              systematics were part of doctoral dissertations previously funded              
              by NSF.  Publication of these volumes will permit dissemination                
              of the research results to the botanical community.
