Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              High resolution transmission electron microscopy (TEM) is a                    
              technique critical to the characterization of nearly all solid                 
              state materials.  The 200 kev Hitachi HF-2000 field emission,                  
              analytical transmission electron microcope to be installed at the              
              Microelectronics Research Center at Georgia Institute of Technology            
              is a cutting edge instrument that combines state-of-the-art high-              
              resolution capabilities with excellent analytical capabilities.                
              Multidisciplinary materials research has emerged as a high-priority            
              area of emphasis of both research and education at Georgia                     
              Institute of Technology over the past decade.  Lack of such an                 
              instrument however has been a major limiting factor in the breadth             
              and depth of the current and planned materials research program.               
              Provision of this modern, research-grade TEM will facilitate the               
              conduct of major research studies on a broad range of materials                
              systems and structures.  It will be made available throughout the              
              Institute and utilized at four different levels: (a) by long-term              
              professional microscopists responsible for operation, training, and            
              collaborative research with faculty PI's; (b) by long-term student             
              microscopists requiring TEM as a central part of their research;               
              (c) by short-term student users for educational as well as data                
              acquisition purposes; and (d) as a service to provide essential                
              research data to PI's and students.
