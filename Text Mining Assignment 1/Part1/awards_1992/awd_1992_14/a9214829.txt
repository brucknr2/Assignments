Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The project is intended to investigate the inhibiting effects of               
              iron and other metal cations on the growth of scale forming                    
              minerals; to determine the specific mechanisms of crystal growth               
              inhibition by metal cations and construct a predictive model; and              
              to examine how temperature influences the effectiveness as well as             
              the mechanism of calcite growth inhibition; and to examine whether             
              metal cations can outperform chemical inhibitors currently in use.             
              How iron and other metal cations affect growth of calcium sulphate,            
              another scale forming mineral, will also be investigated.
