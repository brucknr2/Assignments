Abstract    :
              The National Superconducting Cyclotron Laboratory (NSCL) of                    
              Michigan State University is a national user facility for                      
              research in nuclear science.  This cooperative agreement provides              
              funds for the operation of NSCL, for support of its user program,              
              and for the research of the Michigan State University staff and                
              the training of graduates students in nuclear science,                         
              accelerator physics, and instrumentation physics.  The facilities              
              at NSCL include the K1200 superconducting cyclotron, the A1200                 
              beam analysis and fragment separator system, and a wide variety                
              of detection instruments for use in heavy-ion nuclear science                  
              experiments.  High quality primary beams are available for the                 
              entire mass range of ions from hydrogen to uranium.  Secondary                 
              beams produced by nuclear reactions are also available for                     
              studies of nuclear structure and nuclear astrophysics.                         
              Instrumentation development, particularly involving                            
              superconducting technology, is a major effort supported by this                
              agreement.
