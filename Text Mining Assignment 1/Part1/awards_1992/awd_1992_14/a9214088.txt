Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Pacific University is establishing a connection to NSFNET via a                
              56,000 bits per second line through the NorthWestNet mid-level                 
              network.  The connection enables the school's faculty and students             
              to communicate and collaborate with the national scientific and                
              educational community, and to access network resources.  Areas of              
              science addressed by Pacific include physics, biology and                      
              chemistry.  Another project involves undergraduate and K-12                    
              education.  This award funds part of the costs for one year.***
