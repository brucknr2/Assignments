Abstract    :
                   Alabama A&M University (AAMU) is an HBCU with                             
              the mission, degree structure, much of the staff,                              
              and much of the equipment necessary to become                                  
              America's leading producer of high quality                                     
              African-American physical scientists.  Its major                               
              problem is finding the appropriate facilities for                              
              the research work now under way and soon to be                                 
              added and for a significantly increased number of                              
              graduate students.  The award directly attacks                                 
              that problem of allowing AAMU, with matching funds                             
              from the State of Alabama, to convert two under-                               
              utilized 60 year old buildings into an attractive,                             
              modern research facility, and graduate student                                 
              facility aimed toward high quality work in quantum                             
              optics.                                                                        
                   AAMU is an NSF success story.  The MRCE                                   
              activity begun here 4 years ago set the stage for                              
              the hiring of top level physicists responsible for                             
              this project and the acceptance by the University                              
              President of the dramatic research goals.    The                               
              quantum optics research to be housed in the                                    
              renovated facility includes Quantum                                            
              Computing/Quantum Holography, Ion Beam                                         
              Modification of Surfaces, and Quantum Confined                                 
              Structures.                                                                    
                   This renovation project should greatly                                    
              improve the research environment to attract more                               
              minorities into this area of science.
