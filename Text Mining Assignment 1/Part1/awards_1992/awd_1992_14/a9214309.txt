Abstract    :
                   Hope College will renovate former library                                 
              space housed in the Peale Science Center into a                                
              modern facility for research and research training                             
              in molecular biology-biochemistry.  Specifically,                              
              they will develop a molecular biology/biochemistry                             
              laboratory with an adjoining computer laboratory                               
              facility.  While the new laboratories will enhance                             
              the research productive of all faculty, they will                              
              have a direct effect on the research programs of                               
              four faculty members and their students.  Since                                
              the time of their initial appointments at Hope                                 
              College, these members of the Hope College faculty                             
              have collectively worked with 135 undergraduate                                
              research students, 56 of whom have either obtained                             
              the Ph.D. degree or are currently in graduate                                  
              school.  The renovated laboratories will allow for                             
              integration of all aspects of their program.  They                             
              will: 1) provide a center for crucial and delicate                             
              research equipment; 2) provide extended bench                                  
              space for upper class student researchers; 3)                                  
              enhance the ability of students and faculty to                                 
              conduct collaborative studies; 4) facilitate the                               
              integration of bench-level research and research                               
              training with  computer-based data acquisition and                             
              analysis; and 5) provide a suitable setting and                                
              encouraging atmosphere for students interested in                              
              conducting research in the expanding molecular                                 
              sciences.
