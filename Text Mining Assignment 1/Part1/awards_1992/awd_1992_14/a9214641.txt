Abstract    :
                   This award provides one-half the funding necessary to support             
              a major equipment acquisition at the Woods Hole Oceanographic                  
              Institution (WHOI). WHOI is committed to providing the remaining               
              funds needed for the acquisition of a large-radius, high-                      
              transmission, secondary ion source mass spectrometer system, more              
              commonly referred to as an ion microprobe. Recent technological                
              developments have made the new generation ion probes capable of                
              measuring isotopic species with extremely high abundance                       
              sensitivity and micron-level spatial resolution in samples of                  
              geological interest.                                                           
                   The WHOI ion microprobe will be installed and maintained at               
              the Woods Hole campus and operated as a facility open to the                   
              national geoscience research community. The analytical capabilities            
              of the new instrument will be employed in research areas including             
              the early evolution of the Earth, upper mantle dynamics (melting,              
              melt extraction, generation of basalts), deep-seated metamorphic               
              processes (rock-fluid physicochemical interactions), and                       
              environmental geochemistry (use of oxygen isotopes and trace metal             
              distribution in foraminifera and bivalve shells to monitor changes             
              in temperature and nutrient content of seawater).
