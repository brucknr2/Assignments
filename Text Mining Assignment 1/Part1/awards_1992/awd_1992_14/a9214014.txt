Abstract    :
                   The objective of this faculty internship is to extend the                 
              current knowledge base and technology involved in transitioning                
              from the existing batch mode of planning to real time planning of              
              make-to-order printed circuit boards (PCBs).  The main concept                 
              behind this transition is that any event will be passed directly               
              to a server, which will be a continuously running scheduling                   
              processor, instead of to a database.  The schedules will be stored             
              and updated utilizing an efficient form of computer memory                     
              management termed bitmapping.                                                  
                   Industrial collaboration will allow the development and                   
              testing of a real time planning algorithm using a Novell local area            
              network (LAN) netware loadable module (NLM).  Testing will be based            
              on planning knowledge from some of the major US PCB manufacturers              
              who are clients of the industrial sponsor and are currently using              
              the batch mode planning system.
