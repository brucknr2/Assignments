Abstract    :
                      This award  will assist the College  of Chemistry at                   
              the University  of California Berkeley in  the purchase of a                   
              triple quadrupole  mass spectrometer equipped  with electro-                   
              spray   ionization   capabilities   and   interfaced  liquid                   
              chromatograph. The  instrument is needed  by members of  the                   
              Department   of  Chemistry   and  will   also  provide  mass                   
              spectroscopic  services  for  the  Department  of  Molecular                   
              Biology. Research areas supported by the acquisition of this                   
              instrument are:                                                                
              1)  Structure determination of protein-bound pigments.                         
              2)  Analysis  of  charged  high  molecular  weight fullerene                   
              derivatives.                                                                   
              3)  Design  and  synthesis   of  new  classes of  synthetic                    
              biopolymers.                                                                   
              4)  Linkage  position   determination  of  metal-coordinated                   
              oligosaccharides.                                                              
              5) Site specific incorporation  of unnatural amino acids in                    
              proteins.                                                                      
              6)  Analysis of densely charged poly-onium compounds.                          
              7)  Preparation of peptides with defined secondary structure.                  
              8)  Structure determination of transcription factors.                          
              9)  Structure determination of RNA molecules.                                  
                                                                                             
              %%%                                                                            
                      A mass spectrometer is an instrument used to measure                   
              the precise molecular weight of a molecule. The electrospray                   
              device is a  way to volatilize the sample so  that it may be                   
              introduced into  the mass spectrometer.  This information is                   
              needed so that the  chemical composition and, sometimes, the                   
              molecular  structure of  newly synthesized  compounds may be                   
              determined. An instrument of this description is required in                   
              the Berkeley facility because  the current user needs cannot                   
              be meet with the existing equipment.
