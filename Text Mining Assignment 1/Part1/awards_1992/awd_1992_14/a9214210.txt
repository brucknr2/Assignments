Abstract    :
                   The University of Texas at Arlington (UTA)                                
              will renovate an existing building on the campus                               
              for use as a high energy physics detector research,                            
              development and construction facility.                                         
                   UTA has recently launched a major new                                     
              initiative in high energy physics research to take                             
              advantage of the unique opportunity offered by the                             
              proximity of the campus to the SSC laboratory.  A                              
              large part of the high energy groups initial                                   
              research activity will be the development and                                  
              construction of major components of the SDC                                    
              detector.  Due to the size and complexity of these                             
              components, a large amount of space is needed for                              
              their development/construction.                                                
                   The initial research program to be carried out                            
              in the renovated building will center on the SDC                               
              detector muon system.  This research program offers                            
              excellent opportunities for the involvement and                                
              training of graduate students from small scale                                 
              prototype work through major component                                         
              construction.  The program will also involve a                                 
              close interworking with many other institutions in                             
              SDC and will thereby ensure highly productive use                              
              of the renovated facility by both local physicists                             
              and support staff and visitors who will combine                                
              activities at the facility with their work directly                            
              at the neighboring SSC laboratory.
