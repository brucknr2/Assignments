Abstract    :
                   The classical crystallographic groups of ordinary Euclidean               
              space are basic examples of discrete subgroups of Lie groups.                  
              The crystallographic groups arising in the very rigid geometric                
              structures known as locally symmetric spaces of higher rank have               
              been classified by Margulis.  Witte will investigate whether                   
              these important groups can be realized as symmetries of                        
              one-dimensional spaces.  Witte will also investigate the                       
              crystallographic groups that arise in homogeneous spaces other                 
              than the usual symmetric spaces.                                               
                   This project involves research in ergodic theory.  Ergodic                
              theory in general concerns understanding the average behavior of               
              systems whose dynamics is too complicated or chaotic to be                     
              followed in microscopic detail.  Under the heading "dynamics can               
              be placed the modern theory of how groups of abstract                          
              transformations act on smooth spaces.  In this way ergodic theory              
              makes contact with geometry in its quest to classify flows on                  
              homogeneous spaces.
