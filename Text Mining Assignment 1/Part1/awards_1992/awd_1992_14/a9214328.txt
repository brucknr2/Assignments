Abstract    :
              In this project, supported jointly by the Analytical and                       
              Surface Chemistry Program of the Chemistry Division and the                    
              Metals, Ceramics and Electronic Materials Program of the                       
              Division of Materials Research, the surface and gas-phase                      
              mechanisms of diamond thin film growth will be investigated.                   
              Emphasis is placed on studies of the halogen catalyzed CVD                     
              growth of diamond, and surface science studies combined with                   
              molecular modelling and growth kinetic studies will provide a                  
              detailed understanding of the mechanism of diamond thin film                   
              growth.  Optical interferometry and atomic force microscopy                    
              will be used to monitor growth rate and the effects of atomic                  
              scale morphology on the quality of the diamond thin films                      
              studied here.

              A detailed understanding of the mechanism of halogen assisted                  
              chemical vapor deposition of diamond thin films will help to                   
              optimize the growth conditions and efficiency of the                           
              preparation of these thin films.  Diamond thin films promise to                
              have a wide ranging technological impact as electronic and                     
              optical materials, and a detailed understanding of the growth                  
              process is essential to the development of this important                      
              technology.
