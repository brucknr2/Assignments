Abstract    :
              This project is in the general area of analytical and surface                  
              chemistry and in the subfield of mechanistic electrochemistry.                 
              During the tenure of this three-year continuing grant, Professor               
              Bard and his students will pursue fundamental investigations of                
              electrode reaction mechanisms, broadly defined.  Four specific                 
              electrochemical research thrusts will be pursued, namely (1)                   
              electrochemical studies of bioconjugation, especially the                      
              interactions of small molecules with DNA; (2) studies of the                   
              electrochemical and surface properties of fullerene-modified                   
              electrodes; (3) applications of the scanning electrochemical                   
              microscope to the study of fast heterogeneous and homogeneous                  
              reactions at ultramicroelectrodes; and (4) studies of                          
              electrochemical reactions in novel oxidation-stable solvents.                  
              %%%                                                                            
              This research builds upon results obtained under Dr. Bard's                    
              previous NSF grant, CHE-8901450.  In addition to providing                     
              fundamental new insights into mechanisms of heterogeneous                      
              electron transfer processes, this research is of particular                    
              relevance to the development of biosensors and to understanding                
              the electrochemical properties of new materials and reactive                   
              chemical systems.
