Abstract    :
              The U.S. Global Change Research Program (USGCRP) was the first                 
              "presidential initiative" in science under the administration of               
              President George Bush.  It began early in 1989.  As the first                  
              such initiative it has pioneered institutionally.  In 1993, the                
              the Global Change Program involves eleven different agencies and               
              about $1.3 billion in support of research and related activities.              
              The U.S. National Science Foundation (NSF) has played a                        
              leadership role in the USGCRP.  This pilot project will develop                
              the theoretical and methodological tools to examine the                        
              development of this program.  The pilot will allow the principal               
              investigator to conduct a reconnaissance to determine who were                 
              the key actors in the interaction of federal agencies with each                
              other and, possibly, with relevant parties in other countries, in              
              the development of this new program.  It will allow him to                     
              identify major projects sponsored under the program and criteria               
              by which to select some for further study.  The pilot will use                 
              actor-network theory to consider how NSF has worked with others                
              to construct and maintain a coalition of diverse support behind                
              this program.  Findings will advance knowledge concerning the                  
              federal role in the social construction of science by linking                  
              actor-network theory with an important issue in science policy                 
              and by considering whether and how accountability for "good                    
              science" and for "policy relevance" can be reconciled.
