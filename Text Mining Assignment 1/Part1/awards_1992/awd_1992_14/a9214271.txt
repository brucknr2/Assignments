Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The effects of interstitial nitrogen on the crystal and magnetic               
              structures of new rare earth-iron-nitrogen magnets as well as the              
              effects of cobalt nickel, manganese, aluminum, and silicon                     
              substitution for iron in these nitrided compounds will be studied.             
              Neutron diffraction will be used to determine preferential                     
              occupancies of the substitutional elements on the different sites              
              in crystal structure.  Both neutron diffraction and Mossbauer                  
              spectroscopy will be used to determine the magnetics structures of             
              these compounds and to reveal the detailed magnetic behavior at                
              each of the different iron sites as a function of synthetic methods            
              and processing techniques.  The microscopic structural information             
              from neutron diffraction and Mossbauer spectroscopy will be                    
              correlated with bulk properties as determined by magnetic                      
              measurements.  Understanding in detail how the interstitial                    
              nitrogen and substitutional elements affect the iron and rare earth            
              magnetic interactions will be an important step towards developing             
              even better magnets.
