Abstract    :
              Gray         The rapid evolution of LSI and VLSI digital technologies has 
              resulted in much wider utilization of digital techniques for  signal processing
              and control applications than in the past.  As  the level of integration of
              such systems continues to increase,  it has become more and more desirable to
              implement the  Analog/Digital (A/D) conversion function on the VLSI control or 
              signal processing device itself.  Great progress has been made in  the past ten
              years in the implementation of analog functions of  various types of MOS LSI
              technology, using NMOS initially, then  CMOS as that technology matured, and
              most recently BiCMOS  technology.         This research is directed towards new
              architectures and new  approaches to monolithic A/D conversion which more
              closely  approach the fundamental limits imposed by the technology used to 
              implement them.  Topics of emphasis include self-calibration  techniques for
              high-speed, high resolution pipeline A/D  converters, properties of parallel
              pipeline, or "systolic" A/D  converters, micropower high speed A/D converters
              using charge  transfer signal processing, optimum decoding algorithms and 
              stability and scaling in oversampled A/D converters, approaches  to very high
              speed oversampled A/D converters, and performance  limits for the
              electromechanical sigma-delta A/D converter used  for readout purposes in
              sensor applications.
