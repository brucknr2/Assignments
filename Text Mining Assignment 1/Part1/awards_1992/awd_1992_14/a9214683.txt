Abstract    :
              This award is for partial support for the Twentieth Annual                     
              Telecommunications Policy Research Conference (TPRC) in Solomons,              
              Maryland, September 12-14, 1992.  The conference provides a forum              
              for interactions between national and international scholars in                
              basic and applied research (from engineering, communications and               
              information science, operations research, economics, law and public            
              policy) and leaders in communications and information industries,              
              government policymakers and specialists from public-interest                   
              organizations.   A major function of the conference is to provide              
              a forum for the presentation of preliminary studies to alert                   
              policymakers to new work relevant to their interests and to provide            
              an opportunity for early critical review by peers.  After revision,            
              based in part on comments from their TPRC presentation, the papers             
              are published in professional journals or elsewhere.  All TPRC                 
              papers are collected and made available upon request from the TPRC             
              office in Washington, D.C.
