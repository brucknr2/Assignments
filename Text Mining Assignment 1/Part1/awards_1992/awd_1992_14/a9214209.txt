Abstract    :
              This proposal is for funds to purchase a                                       
              transmission electron microscope for the                                       
              Microelectronics and Engineering Research.  It                                 
              will be used mainly for research in materials                                  
              science such as studies of epitaxial growth  of                                
              Si-Ge films, deformation mechanisms of high                                    
              temperature intermetallic compounds, and                                       
              microstructural development in permanent                                       
              magnet alloys.
