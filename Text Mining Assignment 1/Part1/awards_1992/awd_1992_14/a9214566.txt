Abstract    :
              This proposal requests funds for the purchase of a scanning                    
              electron microscope and an x-ray microanalysis system.  The                    
              Electron Microscopy Center at North Dakota State University                    
              is a common instrument facility that provides the only                         
              access  to electron microscopy on campus.  There are usually                   
              between 70 and 90 research scientists and students that use                    
              the facility each year.  In addition to maintaining the                        
              equipment, the laboratory offers a complete line of service.                   
                                                                                             
              In the last few years, food technologists and cereal                           
              chemists have discovered the need for ultrastructural data.                    
              Many samples such as doughs and glutens are particularly                       
              difficult to prepare for scanning electron microscopy.  It                     
              is well documented that the preparation procedures employed                    
              for biological specimens result in significant artifact                        
              formation.  Cryo-preparation and examination of frozen,                        
              fully hydrated doughs and glutens yield the best data.                         
              Specimen charging is a serious problem with the present                        
              scanning microscope as it is not generally possible to                         
              obtain secondary images at accelerating voltages of less                       
              than 8kV.    To meet the present research requirements of                      
              these scientists and to simulate continued ultrastructural                     
              studies of  foods, the acquisition of  the equipment listed                    
              in this proposal is essential.
