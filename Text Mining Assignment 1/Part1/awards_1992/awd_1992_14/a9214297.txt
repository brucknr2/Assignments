Abstract    :
                   The purpose of this award is to renovate                                  
              Dabney Hall, the main facility of the Department                               
              of Chemistry at North Carolina State University.                               
              About two-thirds of the project addresses the                                  
              serious deficiencies in the ventilation system.                                
              The remainder of the work includes renovations                                 
              required to take advantage of the improvements in                              
              ventilation and to bring the building up to modern                             
              code specifications and improve communications.                                
                   Fifteen new chemical fume hoods will be                                   
              added.  More space for proper chemical storage                                 
              will be made available and research space,                                     
              electric power, and safety showers will be                                     
              modernized.  Finally, a modernized telephone and                               
              computer communications system also will be added                              
              to bring Dabney Hall into the 1990s.  This                                     
              modernization project should strengthen the                                    
              accreditation credentials of this historically                                 
              excellent chemistry department.
