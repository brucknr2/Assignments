Abstract    :
                   The Physics Department at Montana State                                   
              University is utilizing National Science                                       
              Foundation support for a research facilities                                   
              replacement project.  Their current facilities do                              
              not meet the requirements of modern laboratory                                 
              research projects.  The building which houses                                  
              these facilities was constructed nearly forty                                  
              years ago to provide classrooms and faculty                                    
              offices for the Mathematics and Physics                                        
              Departments, neither of which had significant                                  
              research activities at that time.  Since then,                                 
              Physics has become recognized as a pinnacle                                    
              research department within a university that is                                
              dedicated to excellence in research and                                        
              scholarship as well as instruction and outreach.                               
                   Their laboratory research programs are                                    
              focused in three areas: surface science, nonlinear                             
              optics and laser spectroscopy, and solid state                                 
              physics.  Since the initiation of a vigorous                                   
              graduate program in the early 1960's, their                                    
              faculty has had to cope with antiquated laboratory                             
              facilities including inadequate utility services                               
              and crowded conditions.  Their modernized                                      
              facilities will tremendously expand their research                             
              horizons and help attract more qualified graduate                              
              and undergraduate students to programs, including                              
              women and minorities.  Further, these facilities                               
              will enhance aggressive outreach activities in                                 
              science education, telecommunications, and                                     
              technology transfer, and deepen collaborations                                 
              with engineering faculty.
