Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Under this Small Grant for Exploratory Research, Georgia Tech                  
              Research Institute (GTRI) will develop a wavefront sensor camera               
              for the astronomical adaptive optics (AO) community.  The camera               
              will utilize the best available charge coupled device (CCD)                    
              technology.  The camera electronics will be able to read 4 ports               
              at up to 2 MHz each, with readout noise of 10 electrons rms at 1               
              MHz read rate.  The camera will initially use the MIT Lincoln                  
              Laboratory 64 x 64 pixel, frame transfer, 4 port device; for this              
              chip, 1 MHz read rate corresponds to about 900 frames per second.              
                                                                                             
              The Camera will include a controller with 4 modes of operation, a              
              real-time video display and both manual and computer interfaces.               
              An important feature of the camera is that it is adaptable to                  
              advances in chip technology; it is designed to be easily                       
              reconfigured for a variety of CCD chips.                                       
                                                                                             
              Georgia Tech Research Institute and the U. of Chicago are                      
              contributing a total of $260K cost share to this effort during                 
              which 3 cameras (2 for U. Chicago) will be built.
