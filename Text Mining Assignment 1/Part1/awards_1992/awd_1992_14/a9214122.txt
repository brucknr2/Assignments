Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Technical Narrative:                                                           
                                                                                             
              This US-Egypt planning visit to organize a workshop on                         
              environmental problems involves the Hazardous Substance Management             
              Center of the New Jersey Institute of Technology and Suez Canal                
              University in Ismailia, Egypt as well as the Egyptian industrial               
              sector.  The main objective of the workshop is to design an                    
              operational program for implementation of international                        
              university/industry cooperative research projects.  To achieve this            
              objective, pre-workshop site visits to locations of critical                   
              research activities in Egypt will be scheduled for the principal               
              investigators.  Drs. Magee and Abdel-Rahman will travel to Egypt in            
              the fall of 1992 to visit Suez Canal University, which will host               
              the workshop, and several industrial sites.                                    
                                                                                             
              This cooperative science activity in environmental engineering                 
              fulfills the program objective of advancing scientific knowledge by            
              enabling leading experts in the United States and Egypt to combine             
              complementary talents and pool research resources in areas of                  
              strong mutual interest and competence.
