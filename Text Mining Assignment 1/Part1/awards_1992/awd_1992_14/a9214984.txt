Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              A number of spectroscopic, magnetic resonance, and dielectric                  
              relaxation studies are conducted to:  1) probe the relationship                
              between 2D structures and material properties, 2) better                       
              understand the solid-state chemistry of the materials, and 3)                  
              explore the possibilities for producing new "molecular composite"              
              materials of technological interests.  The 2D materials to be                  
              studied have a semiconducting (inorganic) phase and an insulating              
              (organic) phase.  The research proposed involves experiments that              
              examine the effects of reduced dimensionality on the behavior of               
              electronically excited electron-hole bound pairs; dielectric loss              
              measurements that reveal structure and dynamical behavior in the               
              organic phase; and exploitation of solid-state chemistry of                    
              molecular composites to prepare novel photoluminescent materials.              
              These spectroscopic measurements are important because they are                
              difficult or impossible to conduct with other low-dimensional                  
              samples.
