Abstract    :
              In this project a method of pattern completion based on networks               
              of artificial neurons (neural networks) will be employed. The                  
              artificial neural network, in effect, extracts the statistics of               
              the spatially distributed field from punctual observations and                 
              enables the field to be estimated at unobserved locations. The                 
              method has some characteristics similar to kriging, but evolves                
              from a completely different perspective,. It also bears many                   
              striking similarities to discriminant analysis. This similarity                
              is exploited to provide a method of generating random field                    
              samples for Monte Carlo simulation that are conditioned on                     
              information,. The methods can be implemented very efficiently on               
              massively parallel computers and are amenable, in principle, to                
              implementation in computer hardware.
