Abstract    :
              This is a proposal to purchase six color computer                              
              workstation, a high speed graphic server a color laser                         
              printer, peripherals for storage and video graphics, and                       
              related software.  Funds for a 50% computer services manager                   
              to manage the system and provide training and graphics                         
              consultation will be provided by the University.  The                          
              facility would be available to all faculty and students with                   
              either theoretical or experimental research programs                           
              involving computational problems in biology.  Use of the                       
              instrumentation will form a core feature of graduate                           
              research training in computational biology across the                          
              campus.
