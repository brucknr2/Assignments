Abstract    :
              The objective of the project is to                                             
              develop sensors and sensing systems                                            
              that can monitor the performance                                               
              and health of completed civil                                                  
              structures and those under                                                     
              construction.  The project will                                                
              involve a series of laboratory and                                             
              field tests of existing and new                                                
              sensing technologies, including                                                
              extensive use of embedded optical                                              
              fiber sensors for which new                                                    
              techniques will be developed.  An
