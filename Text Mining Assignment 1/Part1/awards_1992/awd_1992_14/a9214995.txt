Abstract    :
              A study of the nonlinear dynamics of charge density waves (CDW) is             
              proposed. A capacitive coupling technique will be developed which              
              will allow the application of local electric fields to a sample on             
              length scales as small as the longitudinal phase-phase correlation             
              length. Measurements of the real-time response of the CDW to local             
              and global perturbations will be quantitatively compared with                  
              recent theory of CDW dynamics which explicitly takes into account              
              the effect of quasi particles on the CDW transport. Studies of                 
              effects due to pulse-duration, mode-locking, delayed critical                  
              switching, nucleation of dynamical solitons, ratcheting the CDW                
              into a self-organized critical state, avalanches and critical                  
              dynamics below threshold will be investigated. The work will                   
              advance the understanding of the nonlinear dynamics of systems with            
              many degrees of freedom and many metastable configurations.
