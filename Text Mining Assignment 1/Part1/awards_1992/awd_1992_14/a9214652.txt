Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The 16th Texas Symposium on Relative Astrophysics will be combined             
              with the 3rd Symposium on Particles, Strings and Cosmology (PASCOS)            
              in Berkeley, California from 13 - 18 December 1992.  The Texas                 
              meeting is known as the major international meeting on topics of               
              relativistic astrophysics, including the physics of compact                    
              objects, cosmic rays, active galactic nuclei and cosmology and is              
              held in alternate years.  The PASCOS meeting is international in               
              scope and unique in its interdisciplinary coverage of topics in                
              cosmology, string theory and particle physics.  Combining the two              
              meetings allows us to provide a thorough exploration of the                    
              interface between astrophysics and particle physics, involving a               
              large audience of theorists and experimenters who work in                      
              interdisciplinary areas.  Research in these fields is sponsored by             
              NSF, NASA and DOE.  Funding is requested to support this                       
              interdisciplinary conference.
