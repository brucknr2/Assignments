Abstract    :
                   The University of Minnesota Institute of                                  
              Technology is renovating about 7,357 square feet of                            
              research space which is used in condensed matter                               
              and low temperature research.  Contemporary                                    
              experimental condensed matter and low temperature                              
              physics spans a wide range of topics from                                      
              understanding the mechanism underlying high                                    
              temperature superconductivity to investigating                                 
              macroscopic quantum tunneling.  Despite this                                   
              breadth of physics questions, experimental                                     
              investigations often share common structure.  Most                             
              experiments involve preparation of materials,                                  
              processing of these materials to achieve a set of                              
              desired properties, and characterization of the                                
              prepared and processed materials to seek                                       
              understanding of the physical phenomena.                                       
                   The facility renovation project being                                     
              undertaken will modernize the research space                                   
              available in order to integrate the processes                                  
              involved in condensed matter research.  Finally,                               
              this renovation project will encourage researchers                             
              in and attract students into a strategic research                              
              area for the Nation, materials science.
