Abstract    :
                   The focus of this renovation project will be                              
              parts of the Burthe-Cottam Building at Tulane                                  
              University Medical Center.  The space targeted for                             
              renovation is in the Department of Biochemistry,                               
              which has been assigned the responsibility to                                  
              house, operate, and manage an institutional shared                             
              instrumentation facility for research in molecular                             
              biology.  Included in the facility will be several                             
              equipment bays, a tissue culture laboratory, a                                 
              room for storage and transient disposal of                                     
              hazardous chemicals (mutagens, solvents,                                       
              radioisotopes, etc.) and laboratories for new                                  
              investigators.  One area will be partitioned,                                  
              furnished, and equipped to provide chromatography                              
              and centrifugation facilities, a dark-room, a                                  
              cold-room, and instruments for general sample-                                 
              handling.  A second area will serve as the Protein                             
              and Nucleic Acids Chemistry Facility.  The third                               
              area will be partitioned and renovated to provide                              
              a multi-user tissue culture laboratory and shared                              
              space for the storage of hazardous materials and                               
              preparation for its disposal.  A fourth, very                                  
              large, room (about 3800 sq. ft) will be                                        
              partitioned to create laboratories, and shared                                 
              work areas for three new investigators.                                        
                   This award will allow the modernization of                                
              this space so that it is totally usable for                                    
              biological research.
