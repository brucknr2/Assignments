Abstract    :
              This award from the Academic Research Infrastructure Program                   
              will help the Department of Chemistry at Mississippi State                     
              University acquire a 500 MHz spectrometer which will be used in                
              research.  The research activity to be supported includes NMR                  
              studies of the conformation of derivatives of vitamin B12 in                   
              solution, bound to a vitamin B12 binding protein, and bound to                 
              a coenzyme B12 requiring enzyme.   Also to be studied are the                  
              solution conformation of catalytically active fragments (5-10                  
              kDa) of the enzyme glutamine cyclotransferase in the presence                  
              and absence of enzyme inhibitors; the distribution of leaf                     
              chloroplast water and the effects of environmental parameters                  
              on leaf chloroplast osmoregulation; conformation and tautomeric                
              equilibria in carboxylic acids, tin carbamates, N-alkyl                        
              formamides, alkyl thioformates, alkyl thionitriles,                            
              N-tert-butylnitramine and N-tert-butylformamide;                               
              chloroheptafluorodirhenium dianion; cis-and trans-cyclodecene                  
              by 1H, 13C, 17O, and 19F NMR spectroscopy;  the geometry and                   
              dynamics of the reversible binding of anilinoacridines and the                 
              geometry of the covalent binding of photo affinity probes; and                 
              the solution structure of the 49 amino acid residue                            
              neuropeptide, corticotropin-releasing factor and the                           
              conformational changes thereof.                                                
                                                                                             
              %%%                                                                            
              Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is the most                      
              powerful tool available to chemists for the elucidation of the                 
              structure of molecules.  It is used to identify unknown                        
              substances, characterize specific arrangements of atoms within                 
              molecules, and to study the dynamics of interactions between                   
              molecules in solution.  Access to state-of-the-art NMR                         
              spectrometry is essential to chemists who are carrying out                     
              frontier research.  The results from these NMR studies are                     
              useful in areas such as polymers and catalysis, and in biology.
