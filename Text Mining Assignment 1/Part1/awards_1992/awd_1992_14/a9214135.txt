Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              A common characteristic of nerve cells is that as they are                     
              repeatedly stimulated, their responses are diminished.  Less                   
              commonly, nerve cells will respond to repeated stimulation with                
              enhanced activity.  Such changes can be observed at all levels from            
              a single cell to a complex organism, and are thought to represent              
              a form of memory.  This behavior is being studied in cells isolated            
              from the adrenal gland of the cow.  These cells are widely used as             
              models of nerve cell behavior since they can be isolated and grown             
              in culture, are embryologically related to neurons, synthesize and             
              secrete neurotransmitters and provide sufficient material for                  
              biochemical studies.  A special technique has been developed by the            
              investigator to stimulate these cells repeatedly and reproducibly              
              and to measure neurotransmitter secretion in real time.  By                    
              manipulating the cellular control mechanisms that regulate protein             
              phosphorylation, the cells can be make to respond to repeated                  
              stimulation by a steady increase in secretion, rather than a                   
              decrease.  To further understand the cellular mechanisms regulating            
              this response, the role of intracellular calcium levels in the                 
              phosphorylation of specific proteins will be studied.  These                   
              studies promise to increase our understanding of cellular processes            
              underlying the formation of memory.
