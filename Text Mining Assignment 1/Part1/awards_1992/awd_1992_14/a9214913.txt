Abstract    :
              Arctic soils are extensive and have an abundance of organic                    
              matter acting as a carbon sink in the terrestrial biosphere. The               
              overall project objectives are to assess the quantity and quality              
              of the organic constituents in arctic soils, to predict their                  
              increased rates of release, and to evaluate their potential for                
              decomposition and movement upon thawing of permafrost due to                   
              accelerated global warming.
