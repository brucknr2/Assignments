Abstract    :
                   Concentration variations of oxygen and carbon dioxide in air              
              are linked by photosynthesis, respiration, and combustion.                     
              However, they are decoupled by air - sea exchange.  Because oxygen             
              is relatively insoluble in seawater, both anthropogenic carbon                 
              fluxes and oceanic carbon fluxes in the upper water column are                 
              rapidly and quantitatively imprinted on the oxygen concentration of            
              air.  In this project the distribution of oxygen in air will be                
              studied in order to constrain (a) seasonal net production of                   
              organic carbon in the upper water column, (b) the rate of                      
              anthropogenic carbon dioxide dissolution in the oceans, and (c) the            
              net rate of carbon dioxide production by conversion of the                     
              terrestrial biosphere.                                                         
                   Variability in the atmospheric oxygen concentration is small,             
              about 20 ppmV over the Earth's surface during the course of a year.            
              This variability is measured to a precision of about + 1 ppmV using            
              isotope ratio mass spectrometry to determine the oxygen/nitrogen               
              ratio of dry air samples.                                                      
                   The oxygen monitoring network will be expanded over the next              
              three years, in order to monitor the seasonal and long term                    
              variability in the oxygen/nitrogen ratio of air.  The measurements             
              of seasonal variability will be interpreted in the context of ocean            
              carbon cycle models and ocean color studies to give an integrated              
              picture of spatial and temporal variability in net production and              
              ocean ventilation on a global sale.  The long term anthropogenic               
              oxygen decrease will be used to constrain rates of biomass                     
              conversion and fossil carbon dioxide dissolution in the ocean.
