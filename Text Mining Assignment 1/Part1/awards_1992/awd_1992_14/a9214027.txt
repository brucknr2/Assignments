Abstract    :
              This award in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic                  
              Chemistry Program supports research by Dr. Joseph S. Merola of                 
              the Chemistry Department, Virginia Polytechnic Institute, on                   
              oxidation addition reactions of various organic substrates to                  
              iridium phosphine complexes.  The substrates involve E-H bonds,                
              where E = H,B,C,N,O.  The reaction chemistry of the series of                  
              E-Ir-H compounds thus generated will be investigated,                          
              especially with respect to the insertion of unsaturated                        
              molecules into the E-Ir and H-Ir bonds.  Thus, fundamental                     
              processes occurring at the metal center in chemistry related to                
              hydrogenation, catalytic hydroboration, C-H bond activation,                   
              hydroamination, and hydroalkoxlylation will be studied.                        
              Anionic groups on the iridium will be varied in order to                       
              promote the catalytic activity of these systems.  Some of the                  
              reactions will be carried out in aqueous solution.                             
              %%%                                                                            
              Oxidation addition reactions play an important role in both                    
              catalytic and stoichiometric reaction chemistry of                             
              organometallic compounds.  The long range goal of this project                 
              is to develop catalyst systems for the addition of E-H bonds to                
              unsaturated organic compounds.  This could have important                      
              industrial implications but since the reaction chemistry of                    
              these potentially significant processes is not well known,                     
              fundamental advances are also anticipated.
