Abstract    :
              This award is part of the Arctic System Science Program, a U.S.                
              Global Change Program.  It will undertake a three year study of                
              the response of the McCall Glacier in northern Alaska to climatic              
              change in the Arctic.  The study will evaluate the effects of                  
              climatic response on the arctic hydrological cycle through                     
              airborne measurements of glacial profiles and evaluation of                    
              glacial volume changes which have occurred over the past 40                    
              years.  The results of this study will allow evaluation of the                 
              relationships between glacier geometry, mass balance and                       
              climatological parameters measured at different locations in                   
              northern Alaska.  Volume change estimates on two other nearby                  
              glaciers will be used to determine the degree to which McCall                  
              Glacier is representative of arctic Alaska as a whole.
