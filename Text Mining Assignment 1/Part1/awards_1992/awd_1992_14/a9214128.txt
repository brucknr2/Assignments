Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Alma College requests support from NSF for an upgrade of their                 
              slow speed connection to a medium speed connection of its campus               
              network to NSFNET.  MERIT is the midlevel network located in the               
              state of Michigan that will provide operations and network                     
              information services.  It will give Alma College a 56 thousand                 
              bits per second connection to the NSFNET, a high speed (1.5 - 45               
              million bits per second) National Backbone network.                            
                                                                                             
              The College needs greater functionality and network speed to be                
              able to access supercomputers, libraries, and make file transfers              
              along with being able to implement a more reliable mail system.                
              Students and faculty research will benefit from the link.  This                
              is also a unique opportunity for the school to explore innovative              
              educational resources.***//
