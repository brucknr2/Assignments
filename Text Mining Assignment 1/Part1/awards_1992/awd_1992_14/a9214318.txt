Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Fairfield University requests support from NSF for connection of               
              its campus network to the area wide John von Neumann Computer                  
              Network (JvNCnet).  JvNCnet will provide operations management                 
              and information services and it will give the University a 56                  
              thousand bits per second connection to the NSFNET, a high speed                
              (1.5 - 45 million bits per second) National Backbone network.                  
                                                                                             
                   Students and faculty research will benefit from the link.                 
              By linking to the mid-level and national networks Fairfield                    
              faculty and academics will maintain a position of leadership in                
              research and educational innovation by profiting from remote                   
              access to super computer centers, data bases and information                   
              services, high speed communications, file transfer and remote                  
              login, and access to library resources. This is also a unique                  
              opportunity for the school to explore innovative educational                   
              resources.***
