Abstract    :
                   The Board on Mathematical Sciences (BMS), National                        
              Research Council (NRC), through its Committee on Applied and                   
              Theoretical Statistics (CATS) will establish a panel to                        
              produce a report spotlighting problem areas in software                        
              engineering to which the application of modern statistical                     
              methodology can be fruitfully applied.  The report will both                   
              emphasize the relevance of employing rigorous statistical and                  
              probabilistic techniques in software engineering contexts, and                 
              delineate opportunities for further research in this                           
              direction.  It will address education and training of software                 
              engineers in statistical methodology, and of statisticians                     
              interested in software engineering.  The panel will be                         
              composed of software engineers (including human factors                        
              specialists), applied probabilists, and statisticians.  The                    
              report will influence software engineering by exhibiting                       
              methods for assessing software productivity, quality,                          
              reliability, risk, safety, and management of software                          
              development process.  It will outline a program of research in                 
              the statistical sciences and their applications to software                    
              engineering.  As a subsidiary benefit, this report will                        
              influence other closely related disciplines, e.g., applied                     
              mathematics, operations research, computer science, systems                    
              engineering, industrial engineering, and quality control.
