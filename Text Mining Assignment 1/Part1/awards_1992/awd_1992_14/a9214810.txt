Abstract    :
              This award is part of the Arctic System Science (ARCSS) Program,               
              a U.S. Global Change Program.  The research project will                       
              implement a regional model of the arctic land-atmosphere system,               
              to use this model to simulate the land-atmosphere interactions                 
              that control the hydrological cycle of a key arctic region, and                
              to project changes in the climate and hydrology of the arctic                  
              region.  Plot-size  and mesoscale topography and vegetation data               
              will be incorporated into the regional model at 40 km resolution               
              to provide a working model of the regional hydrological cycle and              
              a framework for the scaling up of plot size measurements of                    
              surface variables and processes in northern ecosystems.  This                  
              research project is a collaborative component of a larger                      
              interdisciplinary program known as the ARCSS FLUX Program.
