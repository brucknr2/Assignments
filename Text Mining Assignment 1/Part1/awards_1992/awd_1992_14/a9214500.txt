Abstract    :
              9214500  Shapiro   The Harvard College Observatory provides a broad research
              program in   astronomy and astrophysics, collaborating with the Smithsonian
              Astrophysical   Observatory in comprising the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for
              Astrophysics.  The   Harvard College Observatory also provides substantial
              support to the Harvard Department   of Astronomy.  Staff and students
              participate in a wide range of research activities that   involve ground-based
              radio and optical observations of cosmic sources, balloon-borne   devices for
              x-ray observations, and theoretical and laboratory astrophysics.  The Institute
                for Theoretical Atomic and Molecular Physics, of the Center for Astrophysics,
              attracts   visiting scientists and talented graduate students to pursue
              research in atomic and   molecular physics.  High School students are afforded
              the opportunity to learn astronomy   by enrolling in Project STAR, a
              pre-college program at the Center for Astrophysics,   designed to teach physics
              and mathematics using examples from astronomy.   Current climate conditions at
              the Harvard Observatory, an interconnected complex   of six buildings,
              constructed between 1846 and 1972, have been a major impediment in   conducting
              research.  Funds have been requested to upgrade the twenty year old chilled  
              water plant and distribution system of the Observatory.  The modifications of
              the facility   will consist of:  repiping the chilled water system,
              recommissioning the reheat system,   installing a direct digital control system
              for sensing control and monitoring of the chilled   water and heating systems,
              installing circuit chillers and pumps, and replacing fan coils.    The upgrades
              will provide effective year round cooling and climate control to the facility, 
               creating a productive research environment for staff and students.  ***
