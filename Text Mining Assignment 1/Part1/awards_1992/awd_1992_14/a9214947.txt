Abstract    :
                   This award is for the development of an educational                       
              delivery platform to support multimedia instruction.  Multiple                 
              presentation methods will be supported including textual                       
              description with annotation capabilities, dynamic                              
              visualizations and animations, lecture-style slides and                        
              overlays, video windows for aids such as instructor's                          
              explanations, and audio capabilities.  The software system and                 
              other materials developed will be disseminated through                         
              anonymous ftp, and presentations at professional meetings.                     
                                                                                             
              Georgia Tech is proposing to develop a system infrastructure                   
              for a delivery platform for multimedia materials about                         
              computer science data structures, algorithms, and                              
              methodologies.  The platform will support cooperative work,                    
              allowing students and instructors to interact with the                         
              presentations and save annotations for others to view and                      
              hear.  The software system will be portable and will be                        
              available to any other interested institutions.
