Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              PROGRAM:   Academic Research Infrastructure                                    
                                                                                             
              The Academic Research Infrastructure (ARI) program supports 1)                 
              acquisition or development of major research instrumentation,                  
              and/or 2) repair, renovation, or in exceptional cases, replacement             
              of obsolete science and engineering research facilities. This                  
              proposal from the University of Alaska (UA) requests funds to                  
              purchase an automated mass spectrometer with a gas stripping                   
              module.  The instrument will be operated as a shared-use facility              
              to support research efforts of several scientists at the University            
              and aboard research vessels in the Arctic region.  The instrument              
              will be widely used for nurient cycling studies funded as part of              
              the Global Change Research Program.  Joint funding for this                    
              proposal has been provided by the Directorate of Geosciences.                  
              Matching funds will be provided by the University.
