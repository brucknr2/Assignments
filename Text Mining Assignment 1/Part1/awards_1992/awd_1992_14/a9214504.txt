Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This Gordon Conference on Glass will be held on June 29-July 3,                
              1992 at the Tilton School, Tilton, NH.  Its theme is Optical                   
              Phenomena in Glass.  It follows the traditional Gordon Conference              
              format with two discussion periods each day and nine discussion                
              altogether during the week.  In addition, this conference has two              
              poster sessions.  Discussion topics link laser and glass in their              
              multi-faceted symbiotic aspects.  The coverage of topics is                    
              extensive with the central focus on the optical phenomena in glass.

              This Gordon Conference covers topics which are very timely and                 
              important in many new and exciting technological advances, such as             
              glass fiber laser for telecommunication industries, and new dopant             
              ions and optical transitions in fluorescence upconversion processes            
              for new lasers.
