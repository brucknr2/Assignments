Abstract    :
                   Jordan Hall, the building currently housing                               
              the Department of Biology at Indiana University,                               
              is in need of renovation in order to support                                   
              modern biological research.  Jordan Hall consists                              
              of an original structure built in 1954 and a new                               
              addition completed in 1984.  While the new portion                             
              of the building currently provides researchers                                 
              with excellent research facilities, many parts of                              
              the original structure have never been renovated                               
              and are in need of upgrading. The Department of                                
              Biology is vigorously committed to pursuing                                    
              research and to training graduate students and                                 
              post-doctoral associates.  External funding in                                 
              excess of $8 million/year in direct costs funds a                              
              wide array of research projects and supports the                               
              majority of graduate students, postdoctorals, and                              
              even many undergraduates.  The department's                                    
              established commitment to research, research                                   
              training, and to attracting minorities and women                               
              can be clearly documented.  It is imperative to                                
              complement this commitment to research with                                    
              attention to the physical support systems                                      
              available to the researchers in the department.
