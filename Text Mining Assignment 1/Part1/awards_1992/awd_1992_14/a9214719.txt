Abstract    :
                   The objective of the project is to integrate the system                   
              information generated at an industry site.  The information                    
              requirements at the facility are representative of the information             
              requirements in service-related industries, which comprise a                   
              significant portion of the private sector in the United States.                
              These information requirements include data pertaining to                      
              administration, accounting, inventory, customers, research, and                
              operations.                                                                    
                   The project will involve an analysis of the facility's                    
              information flow and needs, and identification and characterization            
              of the types of information involved, the formation and                        
              implementation of the appropriate solutions, a comparative                     
              measurement of performance, and a provision for documentation and              
              training.
