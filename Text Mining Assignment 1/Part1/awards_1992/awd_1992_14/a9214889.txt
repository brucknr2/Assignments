Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              It is proposed to pursue a wide-ranging research program on the                
              quantum-mechanical behavior of matter at low temperatures,                     
              particularly as manifested in systems of reduced dimensionality,               
              superconductors, and matter subjected to intense magnetic fields.
