Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This study deals with the microstructures of block copolymer and               
              block copolymer/homopolymer blend systems.  Self-assembled neat                
              diblock and diblock/homopolymer(s) structures will be formed from              
              chains of various architecture, composition and molecular weight.              
              Emphasis will be placed on novel processing so as to provide large             
              single-crystal-like samples of various desired geometries.  The                
              evolution of the microdomain morphology during order-order phase               
              transitions and during mechanical deformation along particular high            
              symmetry directions will be quantitatively followed to obtain                  
              information on the fundamentals of phase transitions in block                  
              copolymer systems and on their large strain mechanical behavior.               
                                                                                             
              The main investigative techniques are roll casting, mechanical                 
              testing, optical microscopy, small-angle x-ray scattering,                     
              transmission electron microscopy, scanning electron microscopy,                
              digital image analysis, and computer graphics of surfaces.  The                
              goal of the research is to contribute to the basic understanding of            
              processing-structure-property relationships, which can provide a               
              basis for development of polymeric materials with improved                     
              performance.
