Abstract    :
              Research will be conducted on the development and application of               
              computational methods and algorithms in statistical mechanics and              
              related areas in quantum condensed matter physics.  The development            
              of methods predominantly features computation of subdominant                   
              transfer matrix eigenvalues and excited state energies, where the              
              main applications will be (i) universal amplitudes in critical                 
              phemonena and quantum spin chains; (ii) the relaxation time                    
              spectrum of stochastic dynamics; (iii) models for Monte Carlo error            
              analysis; and, (iv) excited state properties of Lennard-Jones boson            
              clusters.  Another topic is the universality with respect to                   
              surface fluctuations (geometric and other) of amplitudes                       
              characterizing wetting layers at bulk criticality.  Lastly, we                 
              propose to develop a systematically improvable approximation scheme            
              for the computation of the finite temperature thermodynamics of                
              quantum chains.                                                                
              %%%                                                                            
              Theoretical and computational research will be done to improve                 
              computational techniques used in dealing with the interactions of              
              large numbers of particles.  A number of different systems will be             
              studied to demonstrate the developed techniques.  The successful               
              completion of this project will provide techniques which are                   
              applicible to a variety of important computationally intensive                 
              problems.
