Abstract    :
                   This award is for the development of a course on modern                   
              processor design that will focus on instruction level parallel                 
              (ILP) processing in single chip processors and will include                    
              techniques for superpipelined and superscalar processor                        
              design, instruction scheduling techniques for ILP type                         
              processor, and instruction-level performance evaluation and                    
              characterization.  A new processor design methodology                          
              involving experimentation and quantitative analysis of the                     
              performance impact of specific design features will be                         
              presented in the course.  Dr. Shen will be writing a textbook                  
              as well as a set of lecture notes for distribution to other                    
              institutions.                                                                  
                                                                                             
              This award is for the development of a senior-level computer                   
              engineering course on modern processor design.  The course                     
              will address contemporary processor design techniques relevant                 
              to the design of current and future generation processors that                 
              exploit instruction level parallelisms.  Examples include                      
              superpipelined, superscalar, supersymmetry and Very Long                       
              Instruction Word (VLIW) processors.  A textbook and a set of                   
              lecture notes will be disseminated as part of this project.
