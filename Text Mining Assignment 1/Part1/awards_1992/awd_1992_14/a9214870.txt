Abstract    :
                   This Industry/University Cooperative Research Fellowship                  
              project funds the University of Washington's Industry/University               
              Cooperative Research Center for Design of Analog-Digital Integrated            
              Circuits to study the design and test of mixed-signal systems at               
              Boeing Company.  The project which is to take from six to nine                 
              months is being cost-shared by Boeing with approximately 25% of the            
              cost being provided by the University of Washington.                           
                   The project is focussing on design-for-test methodologies for             
              analog microcircuits, as the first step towards general analog test            
              and diagnosis problems.  Theoretical and experimental approaches               
              will be applied to analog filters to prove the feasibility of the              
              methodologies.                                                                 
                   The project has been endorsed by the Industry/University                  
              Cooperative Research Center for Design Analog-Digital Integrated               
              Circuits.                                                                      
                   The Program Manager recommends the University of Washington be            
              awarded $25,266 six months for this project.
