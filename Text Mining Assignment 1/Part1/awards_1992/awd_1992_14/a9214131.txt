Abstract    :
              9214131  Holton  This award provides modest support to enable Professor Raymond 
              Holton of the University of Tennessee to collaborate in marine  botany research
              with Professor Wytze T. Stam of the Department of  Marine Biology of the
              University of Groningen, The Netherlands.   Their cooperative research will
              begin at the University of Tennessee  with culturing of several strains of the
              microscopic marine alga,  Phaeocystis, which were collected from different
              geographical  regions.  Dr. Holton will carry out several biochemical analyses
              on  the alga, including pigment and fatty acid composition, and will  observe
              the anatomical features via electron microscopy.  He will  then visit the
              University of Groningen to work for several months  with Dr. Stam and others to
              sequence the ribosomal DNA genes in  order to evaluate the genetic similarity
              among the strains.  The  Dutch group is one of the few in the world that has
              applied these  new molecular biological techniques of ribosomal DNA sequencing
              to  algae, so their experience is invaluable to the joint research.   
              Phaeocystis is a cosmopolitan microscopic flagellated marine  phytoplanktonic
              alga which also has a colonial stage.  It is  important in causing blooms in
              polar seas but also in producing sea  foam which is a nuisance to fishing and
              oil industries and fouls the  beaches of the North Sea.  Various strains or
              species have been  isolated from different parts of the world, but because of
              its  extremely small size and uncertainties about its life cycle, it is  not
              known how closely related these isolates are.  The proposed  collaborative
              research will contribute new knowledge concerning the  genetic relationships
              and basic biochemistry of strains from several  different geographical regions.
               It may also provide a basis for  predicting the ecological "behavior" of the
              various strains and,  ultimately, ameliorating some undesirable local impacts.
