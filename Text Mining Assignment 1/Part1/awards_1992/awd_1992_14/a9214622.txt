Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This award is to support research infrastructure necessary for                 
              multimedia collaborative research.  The project involves the                   
              development of a network of multi-media workstations to be used in             
              collaborative research in education and computer science.  The                 
              research topics explored include protocol design, network interface            
              design, congestion control, advanced user interface design,                    
              applications to education, distributed computing research, and                 
              computer visualization.
