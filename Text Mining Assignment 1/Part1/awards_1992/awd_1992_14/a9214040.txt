Abstract    :
              Studies of diversification at the level of populations of                      
              bacteria in the genus Bacillus are proposed.  These analyses will              
              differentiate among alternative models for population genetic                  
              structure, models of evolution, and the genetic and phenotypic                 
              distinctness of bacterial species in the genus.  The central                   
              focus is on the evolutionary interplay of clonality and genetic                
              recombination via exchange of genes among cells, clones and                    
              species in Bacillus.  The question of how cosmopolitan the                     
              species are, i.e., the same everywhere genetically and                         
              phenotypically, is also a key aspect of the research.  Are the                 
              species truly global?  A great advantage of the proposed research              
              is that direct experimentation with genetic exchange between                   
              populations is possible.  The studies will involve Bacillus from               
              three ecologically divergent geographical areas: Sonoran Desert,               
              high-altitude Rocky Mountains, and tropical lowland rainforest.                
              Such investigations will inform us about the processes and                     
              consequences of evolution in a group of bacteria which have                    
              populated the earth since the surface soils and waters became                  
              oxygenated about 2 billion years ago, and about evolutionary                   
              mechanisms which continue at present among these organisms in                  
              both altered and unaltered environments.
