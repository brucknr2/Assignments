Abstract    :
                   This career advancement award supports the research of                    
              Professor King to study unipotent representations of a given semi-             
              simple Lie group. This will require precise information on the                 
              classification and structure of the nilpotent conjugacy classes in             
              the corresponding Lie algebra.                                                 
                   The theory of Lie groups, named in honor of the Norwegian                 
              mathematician Sophus Lie, has been one of the major themes in                  
              twentieth century mathematics.  As the mathematical vehicle for                
              exploiting the symmetries inherent in a system, the representation             
              theory of Lie groups has had a profound impact upon mathematics                
              itself, particularly in analysis and number theory, and upon                   
              theoretical physics, especially quantum mechanics and elementary               
              particle physics.
