Abstract    :
                   This project will sponsor a mentoring program for women and               
              minority researchers in statistics to help launch them in their                
              research careers.  During each summer, when the Department of                  
              Statistics at Stanford hosts 20 to 40 visitors, many from abroad,              
              three statistical researchers from underrepresented groups will                
              work with mentors to develop their own research.  The mentoring                
              responsibilities of the faculty toward these summer post-doctoral              
              fellows will include collaborative work, advice on research                    
              avenues and on publication, and introduction to the active                     
              research community in the particular subspecialty.  Continuity in              
              the mentoring relationship is expected between the two summers of              
              the post-doctoral fellows residency as well.
