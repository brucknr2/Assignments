Abstract    :
              The objective of the Workshop is to explore how recent                         
              advances in the natural sciences and engineering for                           
              evaluating the vulnerability of constructed facilities                         
              to seismic hazards and the design of remedial actions                          
              may be exploited to develop an effective preservation                          
              methodology for irreplaceable historic construction.                           
              The product of the Workshop will be a research plan                            
              for formulating procedural, analytical, and decision                           
              making strategy for preservation of important historic                         
              construction subjected to seismic hazards, to include                          
              a pilot study to serve as a model for future preservation                      
              projects.
