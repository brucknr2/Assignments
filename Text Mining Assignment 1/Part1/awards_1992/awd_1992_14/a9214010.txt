Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Most Materials to which one is accustomed are infinite in size and             
              three-dimensional in character.  By this it is meant that their                
              special dimensions extend over distances, in all directions, which             
              are much larger than relevant length scales.  An example of this               
              length scale is the interatomic distance.  In many circumstances,              
              however, such as at the point where a system undergoes a phase                 
              transformation, or at low temperatures, other, much larger length              
              scales become important.  Thus a system, which for most purposes               
              might look quite large becomes, under these circumstances, finite              
              and shows dramatic change in behavior.  Quantifying this change in             
              behavior is very important, since it goes to the heart of their                
              understanding of the role of dimensionality both in terms of its               
              technological as well as its scientific implications.  Helium,                 
              because of a number of favorable circumstances, such as its                    
              superfluid properties, is an ideal system to study effects of                  
              confinement and the role of dimensionality.  This project consists             
              of a number of separate experiments, which, when completed, will               
              make a significant contribution to this understanding.
