Abstract    :
                   A new approach to the physics of open quantum systems                     
              emitting photons to the environment is developed using a                       
              quantum trajectories method.  The averages from this ensemble                  
              of trajectories reproduce the results of conventional quantum                  
              mechanics.  The approach has the advantage that it can                         
              simulate real time signals and throws new light on the                         
              problems of quantum measurement.  Another strength of the                      
              trajectory approach is that it is a wavefunction based method,                 
              which avoids the problems of the more traditional density                      
              matrix techniques.  The method will be applied to problems in                  
              cavity quantum electrodynamics and the interaction of atoms                    
              with nonclassical light.  The ultimate hope is a self-                         
              consistent theory of quantum measurements in optics.
