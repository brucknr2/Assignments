Abstract    :
              This proposal is for equipment to                                              
              support research in materials used                                             
              to make roads, bridges and                                                     
              buildings.  The work includes the                                              
              study of materials under varying                                               
              environmental conditions and under                                             
              long-term use.  For example,                                                   
              freeze-thaw conditions applied to                                              
              composite materials and concrete,
