Abstract    :
                   This award to Meharry Medical College, is for                             
              support for renovations in the West Basic Sciences                             
              Building.  This building houses the basic sciences                             
              departments which are involved in conducting                                   
              research including the departments of                                          
              Biochemistry, Physiology, Microbiology,                                        
              Pharmacology, and the Division of Biomedical                                   
              Sciences.  These departments are responsible for                               
              85% of the research grants that are awarded to                                 
              Meharry Medical College as well as 90% of the                                  
              publications.  Together, these departments train                               
              56 Ph.D. graduates, 46 of which are African-                                   
              Americans.                                                                     
                   This award will be used to renovate current                               
              space in the West Basic Science Building.  Funds                               
              will also be used to modernize the Recombinant DNA                             
              Laboratory.  In addition, funds will be used for                               
              addressing the heating and cooling problems within                             
              the building that make it difficult at various                                 
              times during the year to conduct laboratory                                    
              research.  These renovations will result in 6-10                               
              new laboratories which will be available for                                   
              faculty.  The expansion of this facility will                                  
              increase the opportunity to train talented                                     
              minority graduate students in areas where a                                    
              national need exists and for which Meharry Medical                             
              College has an outstanding record.
