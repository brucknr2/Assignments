Abstract    :
              This projects provides instruments to be used in a new, campus-wide            
              Institute for Materials and Advanced Processes (IMAP), to be housed            
              in a new building to be constructed for the College of Mines and               
              Earth Resources (COMER) at the University of Idaho.  Faculty and               
              students conducting research in IMAP will share these instruments              
              with scientists in engineering and the biological sciences.                    
              Research on materials and materials processing has been identified             
              as one of five research areas to receive special attention at the              
              University of Idaho.  COMER has the only Ph.D. granting materials              
              program in the State of Idaho.  Acquisition of these instruments               
              will provide a major improvement in the research infrastructure                
              being undertaken by IMAP and COMER.
