Abstract    :
              This award from the Academic Research Infrastructure Program                   
              will help the Department of Chemistry at the University of                     
              Nevada at Reno acquire a 500 MHz NMR spectrometer which will be                
              used in research investigations in the following areas:                        
              synthetic and mechanistic aspects of artificial enzymes;                       
              sterochemistry and chiral recognition; the bioorganic chemistry                
              of bilirubin; homoaromaticity; thermal rearrangements of                       
              aromatic compounds; the preparation, characterization and                      
              reactivity of carbenes, biradicals, and nitrenes; asymmetric                   
              homogeneous catalysis; pheromone biosynthesis; synthetic and                   
              mechanistic organometallic chemistry.

              Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is the most                      
              powerful tool available to chemists for the elucidation of the                 
              structure of molecules.  It is used to identify unknown                        
              substances, characterize specific arrangements of atoms within                 
              molecules, and to study the dynamics of interations between                    
              molecules in solution.  Access to state-of-the-art NMR                         
              spectrometry is essential to chemists who are carrying out                     
              frontier research.
