Abstract    :
               This  project investigates the design and  implementation  of  algorithms  for
              generating highly optimized code for current  and  future  processors. Of
              particular interest are processors used  in  embedded  applications.    To 
              fully  exploit  the power of this type of processor  requires  compilers   that
               use  sophisticated  algorithms  for  performing  register  allocation,
              instruction scheduling,  global  data  flow  analysis,  data   dependency 
              analysis,  and  processor-specific  optimizations.    This  research
              investigates how these optimizations and others  interact,  and  use this
              knowledge to develop and  implement  new  optimization algorithms that  operate
              seamlessly and cooperate  to  produce very high-quality code.    The  starting 
              point for the research is an existing retargetable  optimizer that has  been
              used to build compilers for a wide  array  of  architectures,  including  both
              general-purpose  architectures  and specialized architectures used in 
              signal-processing and real-time systems.    Its  organization  is particularly 
              well-suited to  exploring  the  implementation   and   evaluation  of 
              cooperative   optimization  algorithms for high-performance processors.
