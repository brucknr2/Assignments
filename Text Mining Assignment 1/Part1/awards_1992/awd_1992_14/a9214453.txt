Abstract    :
                   A modern electronics and instrumentation laboratory will                  
              be developed at the University of Virginia.  This will provide                 
              the support infrastructure for research activities in nuclear                  
              and particle physics, and will develop detectors and targets                   
              to be used at CEBAF and CERN.
