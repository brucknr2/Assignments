              foster a strong research environment.  UPRRP is                                
              therefore committed to the improvement of the                                  
              institution's academic scientific infrastructure.                              
              In response to this commitment, the College of                                 
              Natural Sciences will undertake a project of                                   
              renovation of research facilities at the Facundo

              of the Biology Museum, support facilities and                                  
              three systematics laboratories, now housed at an                               
              older building.  This award will support the total
