Abstract    :
                   This award provides one-half the funding necessary to support             
              a major equipment upgrade to an existing tandem accelerator system             
              at Purdue University. Purdue University is committed to providing              
              the remaining funds needed for the project.                                    
                   The Purdue accelerator facility is dedicated to the                       
              application of the Accelerator Mass Spectrometry (AMS) technique               
              in the geosciences. This equipment upgrade will allow the facility             
              to analyze for rare, long-lived, cosmogenic isotopes such as                   
              chlorine-36, aluminum-26, iodine-129 and others with sufficient                
              accuracy for dating and tracer applications in a variety of fields             
              including ocean science, archaeology, solid earth sciences,                    
              atmospheric chemistry, biological sciences, planetary sciences, and            
              ecology.
