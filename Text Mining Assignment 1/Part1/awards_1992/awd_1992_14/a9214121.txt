Abstract    :
              9214121  Sturmfels    This award will support a joint U.S.-Italian  workshop on
              the theoretical and computational  aspects of Hilbert functions, organized by
              Bernd  Sturmfels, Cornell University, and Lorenzo Robbiano,  University of
              Genoa, Italy.  The objective of this  binational workshop will be to advance
              this subject  area through discussion and comparison of the  different aspects
              of Hilbert functions by a small  number of selected participants.    There will
              be 25 workshop participants, ten of which  will be Italians, as well as ten
              graduate students  and postdoctorate fellows from Cornell and other  U.S.
              institutions.  Important open problems in the  theory of Hilbert functions will
              be addressed,  including the structure of zero-dimensional schemes,  algorithms
              for computing Hilbert functions and  finite free resolutions, Hilbert functions
              of  algebras with special structural properties, and  combinatorial methods and
              polyhedral invariants of  projective varieties.  The participants' papers will 
              be published in a well-established monograph series.   ***
