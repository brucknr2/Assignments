Abstract    :
                   This award is for the development of educational                          
              materials for early introduction into the computer science                     
              curriculum of formal methods and object-oriented programming.                  
              Material on operational, denotational, and logical semantics                   
              will be developed, as well as laboratory exercises and related                 
              materials for teaching object-oriented programming and design.                 
              Colgate University plans to develop a network of computer                      
              science educators from a wide variety of institutions who will                 
              contribute to this project.  Curriculum materials will be                      
              disseminated through Internet, and presented at workshops, and                 
              at other educational and professional meetings.                                
                                                                                             
              Colgate University plans to develop materials in object-                       
              oriented programming and in formal methods for introduction                    
              into intermediate-level computer science courses.  Work on                     
              object-oriented programming and design will focus on the                       
              development of laboratory materials for several hardware                       
              platforms; work on formal methods will focus on two major                      
              areas: program verification and operations, denotational and                   
              logical semantic.  The results of the curriculum and materials                 
              development will be disseminated through Internet, and will be                 
              presented at workshops, and educational and professional                       
              meetings.
