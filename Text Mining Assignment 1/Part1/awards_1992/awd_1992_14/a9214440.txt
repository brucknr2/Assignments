Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  The University of Massachusetts seeks support for its academic            
              research infrastructure in the Department of Electrical and                    
              Computer Engineering.  This support will be used to develop a                  
              remote sensing radiometer (22 GHz) designed to measure the vertical            
              distribution of water vapor in the atmosphere.  The Department's               
              Microwave Remote Sensing Laboratory will construct the radiometer              
              and actively cooperate with meteorologists at Penn State, the                  
              Universities of Wyoming, Wisconsin, NOAA and the National Center               
              for Atmospheric Research.                                                      
                                                                                             
                   Graduate students in electrical and computer engineering will             
              benefit greatly from the interdisciplinary research that will be               
              supported by the acquisition of this equipment.
