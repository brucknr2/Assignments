Abstract    :
              9214096  Wilkens  This award supports Professor Roy H. Wilkens and a graduate 
              student from the University of Hawaii for international  collaboration with Dr.
              Jurgen Mienert and others of GEOMAR, a  marine geological institute in Kiel,
              Germany.   These two  groups share an interest in the measurement and
              interpretation  of acoustic properties and the acoustic stratigraphy of the 
              seafloor under the deep ocean.  They plan to investigate in  great detail the
              variations in several physical properties in  the upper zone of these seafloor
              sediments.  The German  research group has been developing geophysical
              instrumentation  complementary to some being developed at the University of 
              Hawaii.  Professor Wilkens and his student have been invited  to join in the
              planning for and accompany the Germans on at  least one cruise aboard a German
              research vessel.  Both U. S.  and German scientific programs will benefit
              greatly from the  proposed combination of measuring techniques and
              oceanographic  expertise.    The upper ten meters of the seafloor contain the
              largest  gradients in physical and acoustic proerties in the sediment- 
              seawater system.  Within this zone, porosity may change by 20-  30% and density
              may vary by as much as 50%  Modern geophysical  instrumentation such as that
              being developed by the  participating research groups is making it possible to
              locate  precisely and sample the discontinuities where sediment  composition or
              microstructure changes.  Examining such samples  reveals the nature of the
              changes in the sediment and can  provide evidence of changes in
              paleo-environmental conditions.   Such data are extremely valuable in studies
              of local and  global climate change.  ***
