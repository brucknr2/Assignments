Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                                                                                            
              High resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) is a                  
              technique critical to the characterization of solid-state materials,           
              including ceramics, inorganic membranes, nano-composites,                      
              semiconductors, heterogeneous catalysts, geologic and extra-terrestrial        
              materials.  Research programs utilizing HRTEM at the University of New         
              Mexico involve assessment of radiation effects in ceramic materials,           
              volcanic and cosmic dust studies, high pressure phase transformation,          
              synthesis of ceramic fibers and ceramic thin films and coatings, the           
              processing of micron-or submicron-sized particles, design of strained-         
              layer optoelectronic devices, studies of surfaces and interfaces and           
              leaching studies of nuclear waste glasses.  This 200 keV, 0.2 nm point-        
              to-point resolution HRTEM will become part of the existing Electron            
              Microbeam Analysis Facility.
