Abstract    :
                   This grant will cover a portion of the cost of a laser                    
              system and electronic instrumentation, and the necessary                       
              renovation of laboratory spaces.  This new research unit will                  
              make possible a new set of experiments in atom interferometry,                 
              including the development of extremely sensitive inertial                      
              sensors.  This requires dedicated instruments in a low                         
              vibration environment.  The costs will be shared jointly by                    
              Stanford University.
