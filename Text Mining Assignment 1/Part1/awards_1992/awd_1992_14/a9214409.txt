Abstract    :
              The Organelle Molecular Biology Group at the University of                     
              Southern Mississippi is composed of seven energetic young                      
              investigators with common research interests and goals.                        
              The Group's ultimate research goal is to understand                            
              communication between subcellular compartments at the                          
              molecular level.  This goal encompasses three essential                        
              biochemical processes in organelles-- DNA replication,                         
              transcription, and translation.  We are particularly                           
              interested in the regulatory controls exerted by the nucleus                   
              on the organelle and vice versa.  The two best studied                         
              organelles, chloroplasts and mitochondria, are the chosen                      
              subjects in a variety of eukaryotes.                                           
                                                                                             
              Funds are solicited for (1) expansion of the present                           
              capabilities for centrifugation, radioisotope counting,                        
              autoclaving, and dishwashing, and (2) the acquisition of                       
              research instrumentation that is not currently available                       
              (French pressure cell and fluorescence spectrophotometer).
