Abstract    :
                   This award will provide one-half the funding required for the             
              acquisition of an X-ray powder diffraction system to be installed              
              and operated in the Department of Crop and Soil Environmental                  
              Sciences at the Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State                       
              University. The University is committed to providing the remaining             
              funds needed.                                                                  
                   The modern X-ray diffraction system will be used by the PI,               
              colleagues, and graduate students primarily in the quantitative                
              analysis of clay and other very fine-grained mineral constituents              
              of soils in research projects in environmental science and in                  
              pedology.
