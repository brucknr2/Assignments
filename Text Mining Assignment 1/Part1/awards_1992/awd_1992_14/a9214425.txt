Abstract    :
                   Bowdin College seeks to renovate research                                 
              facilities within the Searles Science Building.                                
              These renovations will modernize and upgrade                                   
              research laboratories and research support spaces                              
              to provide more efficient space utilization and to                             
              meet health and safety standards.                                              
                   The primary renovation projects include:                                  
              removal of asbestos, installation of ventilation                               
              systems, provision of new lighting and expanded                                
              electrical service, and replacement of bench tops                              
              and casework in nine faculty research laboratories                             
              and their associated support facilities.  In                                   
              addition, two rooms will be converted -- one for a                             
              biology equipment support room and a clean room to                             
              support physics device fabrication and house                                   
              equipment.  Their current use as animal holding                                
              spaces will be relocated and consolidated into a                               
              renovated solarium.  The general purpose biology                               
              research space will be significantly modified and                              
              upgraded to accommodate increasing numbers of                                  
              independent and honors research students.  All of                              
              these research spaces, except the third floor                                  
              solarium, will also be made accessible to the                                  
              disabled.                                                                      
                   The renovation addresses a priority capital                               
              need of the College that complements other work                                
              currently underway in the building, the renovation                             
              of other teaching spaces.
