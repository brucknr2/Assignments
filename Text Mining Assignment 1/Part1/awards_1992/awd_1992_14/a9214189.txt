              Program Summary:                                                               
              The Academic Research Infrastructure (ARI) program supports 1)                 
              acquisition or development of major research instrumentation,                  
              and/or 2) repair, renovation, or in exceptional cases, replacement             
              of obsolete science and engineering research facilities. This                  
              proposal from Florida State University (FSU) requests funds to                 
              purchase an isotope ratio mass spectrometer with a Gas-                        
              Chromatograph (GC) interface and a microvolume inlet system.  The              
              instrument will be operated as a shared-use facility to support                
              research efforts of scientists in the FSU Departments of Geology,              
              Oceanography, Biology, Chemistry and Anthropology.  FSU will                   
              provide 50% matching funds for acquisition of this instrument.
