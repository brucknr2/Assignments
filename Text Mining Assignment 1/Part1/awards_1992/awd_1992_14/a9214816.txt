Abstract    :
                   Experimentally accessible problems in "quantum chaos"                     
              such as the role of scarred wavefunctions in the suppression                   
              of chaotic microwave ionization of Rydberg atoms, the                          
              stabilization of atoms in super intense fields, the                            
              interaction of intense fields with both hydrogenic and                         
              nonhydrogenic atoms, the description of non-adiabatic ion-atom                 
              collisions and the dynamics of ballistic electrons in                          
              mesoscopic solid state devices are investigated.  Classical,                   
              semi-classical and quantum theories for strongly perturbed,                    
              nonlinear systems will be developed using analytic and                         
              numerical techniques.
