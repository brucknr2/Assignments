Abstract    :
                   Tennessee Technological University request support from NSF               
              for connection of their campus network to SURAnet.  SURAnet is                 
              the midlevel network located in the southeastern United States.                
              It will provide operations management and information services                 
              and it will give Tennessee Technological University a 56 thousand              
              bits per second connection to the NSFNET, a high speed (1.5 - 45               
              million bits per second) National Backbone network.                            
                   The University needs greater functionality and network speed              
              to be able to access supercomputers, libraries, and make file                  
              transfers along with being able to implement a more reliable mail              
              system. Students and faculty research will benefit from the link.              
              This is also a unique opportunity for the school to explore                    
              innovative educational resources.
