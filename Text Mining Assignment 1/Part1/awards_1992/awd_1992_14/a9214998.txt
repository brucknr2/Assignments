Abstract    :
              9214998  Minehart  This award supports Professors Ralph Minehart and Klaus Ziock
              of   the University of Virginia, plus two of their postdoctoral   associates,
              to collaborate in research with Dr. Reinhart Frosch   of the Particle and
              Nuclear Physics Department  of the Paul   Scherrer Institute (PSI) in Villagen,
              Switzerland.   Using an   experimental method proposed and developed by the
              U.S. group,   these investigators plus five other research groups are engaged  
              in a multinational cooperative effort to study the rate of   charged pion beta
              decay to neutral pion.  Each of the seven   groups, including the two from the
              former Soviet Union,  is   responsible for the detailed design and construction
              (and cost)   of a specific component of a novel and highly specialized Cesium  
              Iodide-based detector to be installed at PSI.  This apparatus   will make it
              possible to obtain measurements of pion beta decay   to an accuracy of .5
              percent by 1995; the previous limit of   accuracy was around 3%.  The
              experiment will determine elements   of the fundamental mixing matrix which
              relates transitions   between different quark generations.    Pion beta decay
              is one of the fundamental semileptonic weak   interaction processes.  It
              provides the theoretically least   ambiguous means to study weak  quark mixing.
               Achieving the   greatly improved accuracy of measurement hoped for in this  
              project will enable the participants  to test quark-lepton   universality.  The
              resulting accurate measurements will have an   impact on weak interaction
              theory and on the standard model of   hadronic structure at a fundamental
              level.  This multinational   experiment is far more than any one or two of the
              participating   groups could accomplish alone.  The combination of the many  
              groups will also make mutually beneficial use of special   resources that can
              be provided by the groups from the former   Soviet Union.  ***
