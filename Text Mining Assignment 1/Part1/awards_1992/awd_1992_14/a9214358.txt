Abstract    :
              9214358  Guzman       The University of Pittsburgh's Department of  Physics and
              Astronomy requests funds to renovate  and upgrade the Nuclear Physics
              Laboratory (NPL)  into a modernized facility that will support high, 
              intermediate, and nuclear energy, and solid state  physics.  The present
              facility, constructed in  1964, houses a three-stage Van de Graaff  accelerator
              that has not been in operation since  1989.  With the termination of the Van de
              Graaff  program, approximately 50% of the facility has been  used by 50% of the
              research faculty.  Though  underutilized and in need of renovation, the 
              Nuclear Physics Laboratory has basic utilities and  special features that make
              it ideal for a  modernized laboratory.       Research programs, currently
              located in Allen  Hall, a substandard and overcrowded building, will  be moved
              to the NPL once renovations are completed.   In addition to refurbishing
              laboratory space,  renovations will include the removal of the Van de  Graaff
              accelerators and two large magnets, chemical  and radioactive decontamination,
              and the  installation of additional chemical handling  facilities.  Clean room
              facilities, necessary for  the development of silicon detectors and for wire 
              chamber development, will be installed.  The  renovations will provide
              functional laboratory  space that will enhance interaction among faculty, 
              quality research training for students, and the  ability to conduct
              experimental projects that are  too large or demanding of existing facilities.
