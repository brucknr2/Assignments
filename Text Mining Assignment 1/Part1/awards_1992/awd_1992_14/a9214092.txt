Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Loras College, Clarke College, and the University of Dubuque                   
              request support from NSF for connection of their campuses to                   
              CICnet as an affiliate member through the University ofIowa.                   
              CICNet is the midlevel network located in this part of the state               
              of Iowa that will provide operations and network information                   
              services.  It will give the colleges a 56 thousand bits per                    
              second connection to the NSFNET, a high speed (1.5 - 45 million                
              bits per second) National Backbone network.                                    
                                                                                             
              The colleges needs greater functionality and network speed to be               
              able to access supercomputers, libraries, and make file transfers              
              along with being able to implement a more reliable mail system.                
              Students and faculty research will benefit from the link.  This                
              is also a unique opportunity for the school to explore innovative              
              educational resources.***//
