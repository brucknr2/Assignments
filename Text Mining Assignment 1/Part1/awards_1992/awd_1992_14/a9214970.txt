Abstract    :
                                          ABSTRACT                                   
              OPP-9214970  SEDINGER  This project seeks to develop a dynamic model to
              describe the  potential impact of climate variation on the tropic structure of 
              a coastal Alaskan ecosystem by assessing the degree to which  climate change
              influences habitat structure and availability with  the population dynamics of
              a colonially nesting bird, the Pacific  brant. The area of study, the
              Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta, has been  traditionally exploited by Yup'ik people and
              geese are a  seasonally important resource. A parallel study of native oral 
              history will be conducted in order to access traditional  knowledge of the
              ecology of this region.
