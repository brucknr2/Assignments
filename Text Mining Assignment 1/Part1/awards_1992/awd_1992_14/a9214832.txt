Abstract    :
                   Plate tectonics provides a conceptual framework for                       
              placing a number of structural features in rather specific                     
              tectonic settings, however the effects of second-order                         
              variations are not well constrained.  This project will                        
              examine the possible effects of aseismic ridge subduction on                   
              an active system of faults in Panama.  Presently, two                          
              hypotheses are viable- the deformation is due to "escape                       
              tectonics" resulting in Cocos Ridge penetration or the                         
              deformation is due simply to the west end of the Panama                        
              microplate, unrelated to the Cocos Ridge.  These models will                   
              be tested by measuring displacements of Quaternary terraces                    
              and volcanic flows, structural studies of faults, and                          
              analysis of focal plane earthquake mechanisms.  Each model                     
              predicts different spatial distributions of faults,                            
              different timing and styles of deformation.  Results will                      
              help understand microplate boundaries and interactions in                      
              the western Caribbean/Central America area and are expected                    
              to apply to microplate tectonics in other areas.
