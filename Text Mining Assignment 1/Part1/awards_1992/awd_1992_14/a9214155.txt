Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  Laboratory experiments are proposed to study the effects of               
              simulated buoyancy reversal, radiative cooling, and latent heat                
              release on transport and mixing by buoyant flows.  Experiments will            
              be performed in water tanks, using regular and fluorescent pH                  
              indicators in conjunction with acid-base reactions to determine                
              optically the location and amount of mixing.  Transport of fluid               
              parcels will be measured using ordinary and fluorescent non-                   
              reacting dyes.
