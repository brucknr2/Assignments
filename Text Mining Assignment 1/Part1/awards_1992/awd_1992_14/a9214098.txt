Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  The Principal Investigator will use existing observational                
              data and a state of the art mesoscale numerical model to                       
              investigate a wide range of convective phenomena such as squall                
              lines, severe storms, convective turbulence, tornadoes and gust                
              fronts.  The objective is to advance fundamental understanding of              
              the dynamics and physics associated with these events with the                 
              ultimate goal of providing guidance which will assist in more                  
              accurate prediction of severe weather events.  Specific objectives             
              include:  (1) determining the dynamics and accompanying environment            
              of long-lived tornadoes; (2) investigating the convective behavior             
              of an observed squall line through the use of a hydrostatic                    
              regional model coupled to a nonhydrostatic convection model; (3)               
              understanding the role of boundary-layer convergence/shear                     
              boundaries in the generation of non-supercell tornadoes; (4)                   
              probing the behavior of individual convection within mid-latitude              
              squall lines simulated in environments with horizontal variability;            
              (5) exploring the dynamics of turbulence under dry, moist, and                 
              precipitating conditions through simulation of the multiple scales             
              involved; and (6) further development of the modeling, analysis,               
              and visualization for studying convection.
