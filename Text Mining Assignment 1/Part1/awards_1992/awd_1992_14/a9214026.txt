Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Whittier College is establishing a connection to NSFNET via a                  
              56,000 bits per second line through the CERFNET mid-level network.             
              The connection enables the school's faculty and students to                    
              communicate and collaborate with the national scientific and                   
              educational community, and to access network resources.  Areas of              
              science and education to be addressed by Whittier over the Internet            
              include geology, image processing, physics, mathematics, political             
              science, economics and history.  The library also will benefit from            
              the connection.  This award funds part of the costs for two                    
              years.***//
