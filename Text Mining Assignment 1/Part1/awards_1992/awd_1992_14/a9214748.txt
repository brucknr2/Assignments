Abstract    :
              This project, supported by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and                     
              Organometallic Chemistry Program, involves studies of                          
              structure-reactivity relationships in heterogeneous electron                   
              transfer reactions of transition metal complexes with                          
              particular emphasis on complexes that undergo large inner                      
              sphere structural changes concommitant with the electron                       
              transfer.  The primary objective of the work is to provide                     
              quantitative tests of current theories of structural and                       
              environmental effects on hetereogeneous electron transfer                      
              rates.  This will involve the measurement of accurate rates of                 
              heterogeneous electron transfer rates and the use of                           
              computational methods (molecular mechanics and both                            
              semiempirical and ab initio quantum mechanistic) to model the                  
              inner sphere barrier to the electron transfer.  A secondary                    
              objective is to develop methods that provide accurate                          
              heterogeneous rate constants.                                                  
              %%%                                                                            
              Electron transfer is one of the most fundamental of chemical                   
              processes about which much is known but where many issues are                  
              unresolved.  This project, which is a collaborative effort                     
              between an experimental electrochemist and a theoretical                       
              physical chemist, is designed to improve our understanding of                  
              how changes in the structures of certain metal complexes that                  
              accompany an electron transfer affect the rate of the overall                  
              process.
