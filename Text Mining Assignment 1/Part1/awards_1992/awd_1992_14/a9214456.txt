Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Saint Edward's University is establishing a connection to NSFNET               
              via a 56,000 bits per second line through the Texas Higher                     
              Education Network (THEnet).  The connection enhances the school's              
              undergraduate science education program by allowing the students to            
              communicate and collaborate with the national scientific and                   
              educational community, and to access network resources.  This award            
              funds part of the costs for two years.***
