Abstract    :
                   This award is for the acquisition of infrastructure to support            
              computational science and engineering at the University of                     
              Michigan.  The infrastructure to be acquired consists of two                   
              parallel computers and a loosely coupled high speed network of high            
              performance workstations.  The areas of research supported by this             
              infrastructure include automotive design, computational fluid                  
              dynamics, space plasma physics, computational particle transport,              
              parallel CAD tools, parallel algorithms and architectures, and a               
              parallel computing environment.                                                
                                                                                             
                   These high performance computers will support both                        
              computational science and engineering (CS&E) and studies into more             
              effective use of parallelism.  CS&E is a third research paradigm               
              complementing experimentation and theory.  The acquisition of this             
              computational facility will allow users to explore the interactions            
              between CS&E and both experiments and theoretical predictions.  The            
              use of computation in conjunction with experimentation allows much             
              more rapid prototyping that in turn results in more useful                     
              endproducts, be they science or manufactured products.
