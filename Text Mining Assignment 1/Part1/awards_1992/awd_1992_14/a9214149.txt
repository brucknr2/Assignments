Abstract    :
              9214149  Dongarra  The research proposed here will provide scientific insight
              into the  use of heterogeneous network computing and tangible tools which  will
              aid both researchers and educators.  The proposed research  also includes many
              novel approaches which will be explored.  The  HeNCE programming model includes
              an interesting method of dealing  with distributed memory.  The methods we will
              develop for parameter  partitioning are neither shared nor local memory.  In
              implementing  HeNCE we will gain practical experience with distributed
              scheduling  algorithms.
