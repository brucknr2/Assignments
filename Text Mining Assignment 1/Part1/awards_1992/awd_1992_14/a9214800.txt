Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  The objective of this research is the investigation of the                
              field of motion in the tropical Pacific using four existing VHF (50            
              MHz) radars located in Peru, Christmas Island, Phonpei, and Biak,              
              Indonesia.  Topics for investigation include measured vertical                 
              motion, the vertical flux of horizontal momentum between the                   
              boundary layer and roughly 20 km.  These measurements will be used             
              in cognate studies of gravity waves, thermal convection and tidal              
              oscillations.  This research is a joint activity between the                   
              University of Colorado and NOAA's Aeronomy Laboratory.
