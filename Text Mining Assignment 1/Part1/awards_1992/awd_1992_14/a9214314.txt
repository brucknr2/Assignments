Abstract    :
              This proposal requests funds to purchase a                                     
              special scanning electron microscope that can                                  
              examine wet, nonconducting or uncoated                                         
              specimens without damage in the electron                                       
              beam.  The microscope can examine                                              
              specimens during a dynamical process in an                                     
              experiment.  The researchers propose to use                                    
              the instrument to study polymeric coatings and                                 
              to observe the transport processes involved in                                 
              wetting a solid surface.  Other projects include                               
              the effect of seawater on composites,                                          
              semiconductor surfaces used in electro-                                        
              photochemistry, and hydration/dehydration                                      
              reactions in clays.
