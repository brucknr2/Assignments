Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  This is a proposal to study changes in household and                      
              families in Latin America during the period 1970-1985.  The                    
              project will first describe the nature of changes in household                 
              and family configuration in 14 countries and examine whether                   
              these changes can be accounted for by changes in fertility,                    
              nuptiality, mortality, and migration, or whether changes in                    
              preferences for living in certain types of households, such as                 
              female headed households, also is a source of change.  The second              
              goal of the project is to compare household changes between                    
              different socio-economic strata and between countries in order to              
              test hypotheses about the effects of social and economic changes               
              as the societal level on changes in household structures.                      
              Finally, the project will project household structure in these                 
              Latin American countries for the period 1995-2050 to assess the                
              changing importance of demographic components.  Particular                     
              attention will be paid to the living arrangements of the elderly               
              and the social demands they entail.  The project will use census               
              data for the early 1970s and for the 1980s.  These data will be                
              analyzed by a combination of methods and techniques including                  
              multivariate models to quantify the contribution of changes in                 
              composition and changes in effects, generalized stable population              
              models to obtain information about intercensal flows, and                      
              modified macro and micro simulation models to assess the                       
              magnitude of he contribution of demographic factors and of non-                
              demographic characteristics.                                                   
                   This study will provide a much needed study of changes in                 
              households and families in Latin America.  The study will provide              
              very valuable descriptive information, but it will also broaden                
              the current theoretical debate about the causes of change in                   
              families and households which has been based largely on research               
              done in North America and Europe.  The study will also contribute              
              to the development of simulation models for the projection of                  
              changes in household structure.
