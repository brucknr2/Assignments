Abstract    :
                   This grant will provide funds for capital equipment to                    
              allow the Notre Dame Nuclear Structure Laboratory to pursue                    
              new initiatives in Radioactive Ion Beams, Nuclear                              
              Astrophysics, and Superdeformation and other High-spin                         
              phenomena.  The new equipment is divided into four categories:                 
              new style accelerating tubes for the Tandem accelerator and                    
              associated vacuum equipment upgrading, electronics equipment                   
              for the detection systems, a data acquistion and handling                      
              system, and Compton-suppressed germanium detectors for the                     
              gamma-ray studies.  These are all areas considered to be of                    
              prime current interest in the field of nuclear physics.  The                   
              Laboratory is used exclusively for academic research and for                   
              the training of Graduate and Undergraduate students.  The                      
              University will demonstrate its support by cost sharing on                     
              this grant.
