Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                                                                                             
                  The objective of this research is the measurement of lightning            
              over the equatorial regions of the western Pacific Ocean; the                  
              experiment will compliment the TOGA COARE program operating in the             
              same region.  The characteristics of lightning to be measured,                 
              using 3 magnetic direction finders, include time, location, number             
              of strokes, and the polarity and peak signal strength of the first             
              return stroke.  Observations from a "slow antenna" will enable an              
              evaluation of the direction finder's ability to discriminate                   
              amongst intra-cloud flashes, the detection efficiency of the                   
              direction finder, and the ratio between ground strokes (i.e. ocean)            
              and intra-cloud lightning.  Finally, for flashes within 100 km of              
              the "slow antenna", the charge lowered in each stroke can be                   
              estimated.
