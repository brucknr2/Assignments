Abstract    :
              This Arctic project will measure a number of trace gases which play            
              an important role in the destruction of stratospheric ozone.  The              
              measured species will include hydrogen chloride, methane, nitrous              
              oxide, nitrogen dioxide, ethane, water vapor, nitric acid, chlorine            
              nitrate, carbon dioxide, the chlorofluorocarbons F11 and F22, ozone            
              and carbon tetrafluoride.  The measurement will be made from the               
              ground by a Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) spectrometer                     
              operating in two modes.  The primary mode will be to view the                  
              rising (or setting) sun at high spectral resolution and to deduce              
              the atmospheric constituents by observing the absorption of solar              
              infrared radiation and simultaneously deduce the altitude                      
              distribution of some of the trace gases.  The secondary mode will              
              be to use the FTIR at low resolution to measure emission from trace            
              gases during the polar night when the sun is unavailable as a                  
              source of radiation.                                                           
                                                                                             
              This project is important for the study of global change,                      
              especially for the effects of man-made chlorine bearing compounds              
              on the ozone layer.
