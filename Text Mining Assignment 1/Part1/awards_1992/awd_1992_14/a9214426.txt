Abstract    :
                   The Center for Biological Timing consists of                              
              20 laboratories, 17 of which are at the University                             
              of Virginia.  This award will renovate laboratory                              
              space for five center investigators as well as core                            
              facility research and research training space for                              
              all investigators.  The renovated laboratory space                             
              will be located in the Department of Biology and in                            
              the multistory building of the Health Science                                  
              Center.  The total amount of renovated space is                                
              approximately 12,000 gross square feet and will be                             
              used for the latest molecular bio-technology                                   
              applied to biological timing.  The improvement of                              
              the laboratory space will greatly enhance the                                  
              research productivity and research training                                    
              opportunities in the Center laboratories.
