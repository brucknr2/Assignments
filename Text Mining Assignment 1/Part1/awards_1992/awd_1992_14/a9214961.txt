Abstract    :
              This award is part of the Arctic System Science (ARCSS) Program,               
              a U.S. Global Change Program.  The research project will focus on              
              integrated research that explores interactions between arctic                  
              terrestrial ecosystems and climate.  Field research will be related            
              to measurements of tundra to determine the environmental and                   
              vegetation correlates of fluxes of water, energy and trace gases               
              especially carbon dioxide and methane. Field studies will measure              
              the movement of carbon dioxide and methane to and from the soil and            
              vegetation in the Arctic.  This project is a component of a larger             
              interdisciplinary program known as the ARCSS FLUX Program.
