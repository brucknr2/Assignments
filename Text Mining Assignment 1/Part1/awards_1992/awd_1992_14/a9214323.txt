Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Research in advanced materials and composites requires processing,             
              machining, and evaluation facilities.  Some modern processing and              
              evaluation equipment have been developed for research in advanced              
              materials at Clemson.  Advanced materials is one of three major                
              research areas in the university's five year plan.  This electrical            
              discharge equipment will provide capability to safely produce                  
              composite parts and test specimens for research projects in the                
              College of Engineering and the School of Textiles.  The equipment              
              will support research projects in metal, polymer, carbon, and                  
              ceramic matrix composites.
