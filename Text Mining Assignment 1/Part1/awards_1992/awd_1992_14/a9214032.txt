Abstract    :
              When environmental regulations are proposed by the EPA or other                
              federal regulatory agencies, both the regulator and regulated,                 
              and sometimes third parties, prepare estimates of the cost of                  
              compliance.  The purpose of this research is to analyze the                    
              differences between the initial cost estimates before compliance               
              and the actual costs of compliance.  The first part of the                     
              project will analyze the use of cost estimates by the various                  
              parties from a theoretical perspective.  The second part, which                
              is the major emphasis of the research, involves a number of case               
              studies of EPA regulations.  In these case studies the estimated               
              compliance cost made by different parties will be systematically               
              compared to the actual compliance costs, and any divergence                    
              between actual and estimated costs will be analyzed.  This                     
              research is important because it should help to shed light on the              
              suspicion that regulated firms frequently overestimate cost                    
              estimates in an effort to effect regulatory outcomes, while                    
              regulatory agencies and third parties tend to underestimate them.
