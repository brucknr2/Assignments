Abstract    :
              Quantitative knowledge of the structure of surfaces and interfaces             
              is fundamental to the resolution of a host of important scientific             
              questions.  Research will be conducted using multiple scattering               
              methods to analyze data from diffraction spectroscopies sensitive              
              to short-range and long-range order in materials.  In particular,              
              development of direct methods for structural determination will be             
              undertaken.  It is a long-standing goal of structural analysis to              
              develop methods to invert diffraction patterns to produce direct               
              structural information.  Direct methods which produce atomic                   
              resolution in real space will be investigated.  Analytical and                 
              numerical studies will be closely coupled to experimental programs.            
              %%%                                                                            
              The goal of this research is to develop sophisticated methods to               
              extract information about the positions of atoms at atomic                     
              resolutions from diffraction data.  This is an extremely important             
              program and is closely coupled to various experimental programs                
              throughout the world.  Before full understanding of surfaces,                  
              interfaces and bulk solids can be obtained, we must know where the             
              atoms are and how they behave under various external stimuli.  One             
              of the techniques used to achieve this is electron holography.
