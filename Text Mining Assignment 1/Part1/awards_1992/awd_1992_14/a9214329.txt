Abstract    :
              This award supports Professor James H. Power of Louisiana State                
              University to collaborate in marine biology research with Professor            
              Henk W. van der Veer of the Netherlands Institute for Sea Research             
              (NIOZ).  The objective of their research is to obtain an innovative            
              and comprehensive set of key measurements on individual fish larvae            
              that will fully characterize the animal's size-specific growth as              
              well as the response of these measures to different food levels.               
              They will obtain the typical values of these measurements in                   
              cultured populations of plaice larvae, and evaluate their observed             
              distributions, variability and the strengths of their relationships            
              to one another.  NIOZ staff has experience and special facilities              
              for culturing plaice larvae for use in their own ongoing research.             
              Dr. Power brings special apparatus and techniques that he has                  
              developed for determining larval mass, body volume, and                        
              morphometrics.  Both groups will be involved in the data analysis              
              and interpretation.                                                            
                                                                                             
              This research addresses one of the very important objectives of                
              marine biological research:  understanding how various biological              
              and environmental factors affect the abundance of a given marine               
              population. The joint research will identify baseline development              
              patterns that are expected to be significant in field studies of               
              population recruitment.  In addition, it may provide indicators for            
              identifying especially healthy or stressed individuals and for                 
              predicting continued survival.
