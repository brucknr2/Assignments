Abstract    :
              Medical research and clinical practice will benefit form real time             
              access to supercomputers, direct interaction with other researchers            
              and clinicians, and the ability to transmit images and other large             
              data files in a real time mode.  This will be made possible by the             
              High Performance Computing and Communications (HPCC) Project and               
              the National Research and Education Network (NREN)>  The                       
              availability and description of these capabilities needs to be made            
              known to the medical informatics community.  The conference theme,             
              together with the published abstracts of the presentations, is                 
              designed to accomplish this objective.  This conference will bring             
              together policy level representatives from the numerous                        
              constituencies which are essential for the design, development,                
              deployment, and operation of a robust, high performance computer               
              network to meet pressing needs for improved research collaboration             
              and productivity in the United States.
