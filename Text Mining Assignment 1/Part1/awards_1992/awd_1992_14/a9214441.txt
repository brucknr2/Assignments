Abstract    :
              9214441  Bennett  This award will provide funding for the renovation of areas in
               existing facilities for undergraduate research and research  training in
              biology, chemistry and geoscience at Hobart and  William Smith Colleges.  The
              existing structures, Lansing and  Eaton Halls, were built in 1952 and 1961 as
              conventional  facilities for undergraduate science instruction and are 
              currently inadequate for the mission of the institution that all  students
              pursuing scientific disciplines be involved in research  training,
              independently and in collaboration with research  faculty.  Laboratories are
              deficient in size, configuration,  technical specifications, safety provisions
              and are not  accessible to handicap students and faculty.  Due to overcrowded 
              conditions in the laboratories, the number of students that can  be
              accommodated is limited.  Research space competes with  instrumentation and
              equipment storage, further eroding the  functionality of the existing space.   
              In addition to refurbishing laboratory space, renovations will  include
              installing new fume hoods, upgrading the electrical and  plumbing systems and
              removing all hazardous materials that make  for an unsafe environment.  The
              modernization and enhancement of  the Colleges' facilities for research and
              research training in  the sciences will therefore contribute directly to the
              pipeline  of college graduates entering the nation's base of scientific 
              personnel, expanding access in the process to women and  individuals of diverse
              ethnic background.  ***
