Abstract    :
                   This research will examine goodness-of-fit tests for                      
              multivariate data modeled using distribution-free or                           
              nonparametric models.  The small sample behavior of test                       
              statistics based on spacings will be investigated using Monte                  
              Carlo methods and will be compared to limiting distribution                    
              theoretical results.  By constructing statistically equivalent                 
              blocks, test statistics can be extended to the multidimensional                
              case.                                                                          
                   When trying to represent an underlying explanatory or                     
              descriptive model for real multivariate data, a crucial                        
              difficulty is to determine when a postulated model is adequate.                
              The fewer the mathematical assumptions made initially, the more                
              difficult in general to be sure that the model does represent the              
              important features, but not any artifacts of a particular sample.              
              Some mathematical theory has been developed for the case of an                 
              arbitrarily large sample; some theory has been developed when the              
              data is assumed to follow a Gaussian (normal) distribution.  This              
              project will examine tests of model adequacy when the samples are              
              not extremely large and at the same time the distribution cannot               
              be assumed to be normal.  The work will concentrate on multi-                  
              variate observations.
