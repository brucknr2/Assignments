Abstract    :
                   This award is for repair and rehabilitation                               
              of the Glassell Building and its contiguous pen.                               
              This seawater facility is utilized by every                                    
              scientific research program on the RSMAS campus                                
              that requires direct access to seawater.  These                                
              programs include investigations in coral ecology,                              
              plankton ecology, pathology, physiology, animal                                
              behavior, bioacoustics, biochemistry and the                                   
              culture of marine organisms.  It also provides                                 
              space and instrumentation for both graduate and                                
              undergraduate students being trained in one or                                 
              more of these disciplines.  This renovation is                                 
              indispensable for continuing and expanding these                               
              and future programs at the School and is essential                             
              if they are to achieve and maintain state-of-the-                              
              art capabilities in experimental marine biology.                               
              Currently, users are handicapped by the difficult                              
              environment of a building that has served as the                               
              School's major seawater facility for 28 years.                                 
              Within the last two years, the School has                                      
              conducted a major renovation of the entire                                     
              exterior of the Glassell Building, including                                   
              various structural repairs, supervised and                                     
              certified by structural engineers.  These have                                 
              assured that the building will be safe and secure                              
              for many years to come.  This award will complete                              
              the renovation of the entire facility.
