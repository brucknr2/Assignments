Abstract    :
              Ralph Roskies and Michael Levine have organized a workshop on Fast             
              Processes in Protein Folding Dynamics.  Understanding how proteins             
              fold is one of the central challenges in biology today.  Only                  
              recently, with the advent of advanced computational methods, has               
              it been possible to simulate the dynamics of protein folding.  To              
              apply theoretical and computational approaches in biology it is                
              essential to link in experimentation; today, technical limitations             
              lie in the way of interlinking theory, simulation, and experiment.             
              The workshop will be structure to develop new approaches to central            
              questions or challenges by bringing together scientists from                   
              different disciplines who would ordinarily not attend the same                 
              meeting, by developing seed questions in advance of the meeting to             
              focus the discussion throughout the course of the meeting, by                  
              setting aside specific panel sessions following each major set of              
              talks to allow open and extensive discussion of possibilities and              
              difficulties.  The meeting will help  set a research agenda for a              
              diverse community of scientist drawn from several disciplines.
