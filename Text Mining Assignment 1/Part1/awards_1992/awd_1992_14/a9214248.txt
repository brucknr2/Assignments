Abstract    :
              Expansive soils damage to                                                      
              residential and light commercial                                               
              occur in many parts of the United                                              
              States and it has been estimated to                                            
              cause annual losses on the order of                                            
              $6-7 million.  The project will                                                
              test laboratory models and full-                                               
              scale prototypes of a device called                                            
              foundation isolation tube which is                                             
              intended to greatly reduce damage                                              
              to structure foundations caused by                                             
              expansive soils.  In both sets of                                              
              tests, the performance of                                                      
              instrumented drilled shafts                                                    
              constructed both, with and without                                             
              foundation isolation tubes will be

              will verify the effectiveness of                                               
              this mitigation technique in

              research will provide an improved
