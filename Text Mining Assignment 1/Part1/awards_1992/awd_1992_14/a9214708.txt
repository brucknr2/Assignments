Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This International Conference on Electrosensory systems will be held           
              in Montreal on August 6-8, l992 in conjunction with the                        
              International Society of Neuroethology and which will include 29               
              invited speakers.  It is the first such conference on electrosensory           
              systems in 20 years, a period which has seen major advances in                 
              understanding this unusual and little-recognized sensory system.               
              All of the speakers are recognized authorities in this area, and the           
              conference provides an important and unique opportunity for the                
              exchange and integration of current knowledge.  The proceedings of             
              the conference will be published by a high-quality journal, The                
              Journal of Comparative Physiology.
