Abstract    :
              This project is to address the issues of accessibility of                      
              computer equipment by persons with visual disabilities.                        
              Concern is expressed that the current trends in visual                         
              interfaces may significantly inhibit access by such                            
              individuals.  Within this project input will be obtained by                    
              potential users, prototype systems will be developed and                       
              tested by users, and based on feedback, appropriate revisions                  
              in the system will be implemented.  Finally, the materials                     
              developed will be distributed to individuals and organizations                 
              who can benefit from it.  The work is an extension of the                      
              previously funded "UnWindows" project.
