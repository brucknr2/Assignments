Abstract    :
                   Kalamazoo College is seeking funding for                                  
              renovation of space in the Olds-Upton building                                 
              (originally built in 1927), previously devoted to                              
              chemistry, biology and physics.  The renovated                                 
              building now will house the Departments of                                     
              Mathematics, Computer Science, and Psychology, in                              
              addition of Physics.  Renovation will include:                                 
              improvement of the building's heating, cooling, and                            
              electrical systems; bringing the building into                                 
              compliance with modern building codes and refitting                            
              for proper ventilation, handicap accessing, and                                
              fire sprinkler systems; removal of fume hoods,                                 
              plumbing, and specialized laboratory benches; and                              
              cleaning and flushing of two organic chemistry                                 
              laboratories in order to meet health codes.                                    
                   These improvements will have a major impact on                            
              approximately two-thirds of the Science Division                               
              graduates who select a senior individualized                                   
              project that involves experimental research and who                            
              go on either to graduate programs or directly into                             
              research and development environments.//
