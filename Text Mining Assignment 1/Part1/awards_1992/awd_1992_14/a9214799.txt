Abstract    :
              This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation Program                 
              and the National Instrumentation and Facilities Program of the                 
              Division of Materials Research will help the Department of                     
              Chemistry and Biochemistry at Arizona State University acquire                 
              a console for a 400 MHz Nuclear Magnetic Resonance spectrometer                
              which will be used in the following research projects:                         
              structural and dynamic studies of silicate glasses and solid                   
              electrolytes, the synthesis and characterization of advanced                   
              ceramic materials, artificial photosynthesis and solar energy                  
              conversion, mechanisms for the repair of photochemically                       
              damaged DNA, the nature of macromolecular organic materials of                 
              extra-terrestrial orgin, the role of NMR in computer-enhanced                  
              structure elucidation, and the synthesis and complete                          
              structural determination of complex natural products and                       
              transition metal complexes.

              Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is the most                      
              powerful tool for the elucidation of the structure of                          
              molecules.  It is used to identify unknown substances,                         
              characterize specific arrangements of atoms within molecules,                  
              and to study the dynamics of interactions between molecules in                 
              solution.  Access to state-of-the-art NMR spectrometry is                      
              essential to chemists who are carrying out frontier research.
