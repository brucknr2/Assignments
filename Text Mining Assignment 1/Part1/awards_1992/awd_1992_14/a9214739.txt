Abstract    :
              Theoretical research will be conducted on materials for which                  
              electron correlations play a fundamental role, focusing on heavy               
              fermion and high-temperature superconductors.  The heavy fermion               
              system will be attacked using both phenomenological techniques and             
              fundamental studies of microscopic origins with an emphasis on the             
              coupling of the superconducting order parameter with the staggered             
              magnetization.  For high-temperature superconductors, analysis will            
              be conducted on the theoretical basis for photoemission                        
              experiments.  Variational Monte Carlo techniques will be used to               
              study the interplay between correlation and disorder in both of                
              these systems.                                                                 
              %%%                                                                            
              Theoretical research will be undertaken on fundamental issues                  
              relating to two very important systems of current interest: high-              
              temperature superconductors and heavy fermion superconductors.                 
              Insight into both of these systems will affect basic concepts of               
              condensed matter and materials physics, yet has the potential to               
              have significant payoff in the commercial arena.
