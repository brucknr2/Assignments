Abstract    :
              The long-term goal of this work is to develop and evaluate                     
              auditory representations of multidimensional data.  For some                   
              forms of data (e.g., time series) auditory displays may be                     
              especially well suited to human perceptual analysis and possibly               
              much more effective than current visual displays.  Auditory data               
              representation is fundamentally a mapping from a data variable to              
              a property of a sonic event.  Where the variable is                            
              multidimensional, the measure on each dimension of the data                    
              sample determines the value of the corresponding sound property                
              of the event, and the values of all the measures together                      
              determine the overall character of the event.  For example, if                 
              the event is a simple tone, one data dimension could be mapped to              
              pitch, another to loudness, and a third to duration.  A variety                
              of auditory displays can be created depending on the kind of data              
              and the kind of analysis to be conducted.  Research in auditory                
              data representation has been severely hampered by the lack of an               
              appropriate computing environment.  The Principal Investigators                
              are building a prototype computing environment for research in                 
              auditory data representation and, using this environment, to                   
              develop several different auditory data representations and to                 
              conduct preliminary evaluations of these auditory data                         
              representations with both real and synthetic data.
