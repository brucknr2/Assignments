Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This project involves the dissertation research of an                          
              anthropology student from NYU studying the tension between local               
              and national cultural identities in France.  The student will do               
              an intensive case study of a regional volunteer theater group,                 
              which attempts to present artistic works representing national                 
              "culture" while interpreting them in a way to support the local                
              (regional) culture.  The study will focus on the tension between               
              the group's representation of national and local culture.                      
                                                                                             
              This research is important because the nature of national                      
              cultural integration in modern nation states is not well                       
              understood.  The recent destruction of states like Yugoslavia                  
              show that local and regional cultural interests can remain vital               
              and alive over many years.  This sort of cultural study will show              
              how such ideas and values are instituted in a local culture in                 
              contradiction to the influences from the national center.
