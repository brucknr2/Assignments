Abstract    :
                   The proposal focuses on the measurement of absolute electron              
              impact cross sections in gases needed to model industrial                      
              plasmas.  Processes studied include dissociative attachment,                   
              ionization and neutral dissociation.  In addition, some ion-                   
              molecule reactions will be studied to shed light on the                        
              mechanisms involved in Coulomb explosion reactions.  These                     
              processes may play a role in understanding the use of high energy              
              radiation to decompose toxic wastes.
