Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The primary objective of this research is to clarify a number of               
              aspects of the peopling of the New World.  It has been known for               
              decades that Native Americans are derived from an Asian ancestor.              
              However, many questions remain, including a number relating to the             
              population size and structure of the first Americans.  The                     
              investigators propose to gather a sizable body of data on variation            
              in nuclear genes in samples of Native Americans representative of              
              both North and South American Amerindians.  These data will be used            
              to assess hypotheses based upon alternative population histories.              
              Similar reconstructions have been analyzed based upon mitochondrial            
              DNA data.  As mtDNA is inherited in a very different manner than               
              nuclear DNA, comparisons between the two data sets will be                     
              instructive.
