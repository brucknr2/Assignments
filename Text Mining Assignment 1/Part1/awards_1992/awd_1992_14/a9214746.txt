Abstract    :
              The goal of this project is to understand how initiation of DNA                
              replication is coupled to growth rate.  To understand how the                  
              frequency of the initiation event is determined, the mechanisms                
              that regulate the expression of the DnaA protein must be                       
              understood.  Both genetics and biochemistry are being used to                  
              elucidate the regulatory circuits controlling expression of the                
              dnaA operon promoters.  The growth rate regulator and alarmone,                
              guanosine tetraphosphate (ppGpp), inhibits transcription from the              
              dnaA P2 promoter.  The molecular basis of this inhibition is being             
              characterized in vitro. Mutants defective in the inhibitory                    
              response to ppGpp will be examined for growth rate regulation and              
              precise timing of initiation of DNA replication in the cell cycle.             
              We will determine whether the dnaA gene is still under growth rate             
              control in cells that lack ppGpp - is there a growth rate                      
              regulation mechanism other than ppGpp that controls the expression             
              of DnaA protein?  We will investigate DnaA protein-DNA interactions            
              by isolation and characterization of DnaA mutant proteins with                 
              altered DNA-binding specificities.  We will construct a chromosomal            
              mutation with genes on either side of oriC deleted, and the                    
              resulting mutant will be examined for loss of precise timing in the            
              cell cycle.

              This research studies the control of a key step in cell divison and            
              should provide significant insights into a basic question in                   
              biology, as well as abberant conditions suchs as uncontrolled cell             
              mutiplication.
