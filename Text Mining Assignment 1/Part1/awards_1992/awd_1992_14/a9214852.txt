Abstract    :
                   The long term goal of this research is to achieve a better                
              understanding of microstructure formation during solidification.               
              Experimental studies are conducted on mushy zone solidification to             
              create improved models of the process.  The emphasis is on mushy               
              zone evolution, particularly in the early phases of the mushy zone             
              formation, and how this structure couples with the large-scale                 
              transport processes associated with alloy solidification.                      
              Nucleation and grain fragmentation is observed under various flow              
              conditions.  Effects of forced convection, solute concentration,               
              and undercooling on the fragmentation process is determined.                   
              Experiments are planned to determine how the final solid phase                 
              formation interacts with the mushy zone.                                       
              %%%                                                                            
                   Success in this approach would permit development of a                    
              predictive theory for real casting and solidification processes                
              down to the mesoscopic (0.1 - 100 micron) scale.
