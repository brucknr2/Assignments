Abstract    :
              This research project, supported by the Analytical and Surface                 
              Chemistry Program, explores the dynamics of adsorbate                          
              photofragmentation and photoreaction on platinum single crystal                
              surfaces.  Both UHV surface science techniques as well as laser                
              spectroscopic methods will be used to provide detailed                         
              information about the process of photoinduced reactions on                     
              solid surfaces.  The restricted geometry and energy range                      
              probed in these surface aligned photoreactions may provide a                   
              general understanding of chemical reaction dynamics, and will                  
              challenge our present understanding of reaction processes at                   
              solid surfaces.                                                                
              %%%                                                                            
              The reaction between adsorbed molecules initiated by the                       
              absorption of light will be used as a general probe of the                     
              dynamics of chemical reactions.  The insight gained from these                 
              studies will increase our understanding of surface reactions in                
              particular, and molecular reaction chemistry in general.  In                   
              addition, there may be benefits to the understanding of                        
              important surface catalyzed reaction processes.
