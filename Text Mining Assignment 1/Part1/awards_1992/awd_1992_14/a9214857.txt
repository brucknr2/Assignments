Abstract    :
              This research will evaluate recent variations of surface air                   
              temperature over the Arctic and subarctic through consolidation                
              and comparison of existing data on Arctic surface air temperature              
              from high-latitude land stations, Arctic Ocean ice stations and                
              from sub-arctic sea surface temperatures. These data will be                   
              examined for evidence of changes consistent with model                         
              projections of greenhouse warming, which has been shown to be                  
              amplified in polar regions during the non-summer months.  The                  
              dataset will span the past several decades, 1950 to present, and               
              will cover the region pole-ward of 45 degrees north latitude.                  
              The study will also assess the magnitude of the urbanization                   
              effect at northern land stations.  This research is collaborative              
              with DPP 9214793.
