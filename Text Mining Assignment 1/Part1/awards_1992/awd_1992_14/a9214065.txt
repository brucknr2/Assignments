Abstract    :
                   The PI will direct his doctoral student, J. J. Cao in a                   
              project involving asymptotic series analysis in solid mechanics                
              and an analysis of the von Karman plate equations.  Furthermore,               
              the techniques will be adapted to study problems in fluid                      
              mechanics and compressible fluid flow.                                         
                   Some of the more intricate algebraic manipulations will be                
              performed on computers using symbolic computer algebra software.
