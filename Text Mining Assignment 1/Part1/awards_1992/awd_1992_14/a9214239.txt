Abstract    :
              This award supports Professor Mark W. Meisel of the                            
              Microkelvin Research Laboratory at the University of Florida                   
              to collaborate in low temperature physics and cryogenic                        
              engineering research with Professor Georgio Frossati and                       
              others of the Ultralow Temperature Group at the Kamerlingh                     
              Onnes Laboratorium of the University of Leiden, Netherlands.                   
              The proposed research in physics will focus on several                         
              difficult problems associated with the study of phase                          
              boundaries and polarization in superfluid Helium-3 and                         
              highly polarized forms of normal liquid and superfluid                         
              helium-3.  Their efforts in cryogenic engineering will                         
              address the problems of achieving ultralow temperature in                      
              continuous and pulsed ultra-high magnetic fields and on the                    
              design of heat exchangers which are tuned to cool pure                         
              Helium-3/Helium-4 mixtures to heretofore unattainable low                      
              temperatures.                                                                  
                                                                                             
              The field of experimental ultralow temperature physics, by                     
              its nature, requires careful attention and innovative                          
              thought in both physics and cryogenic engineering.                             
              The proposed international collaboration links two leading                     
              ultra-low temperature research groups which are interested                     
              in pursuing both the science and the technology necessary to                   
              attack fundamental problems in this field.  Together, they                     
              will be in an even stronger position to design new                             
              approaches to questions that require novel techniques to                       
              advance the state-of-the-art.
