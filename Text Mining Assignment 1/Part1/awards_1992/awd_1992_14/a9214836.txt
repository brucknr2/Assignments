Abstract    :
              The National Snow and Ice Data Center is undertaking a two-year                
              project for management of data produced by the                                 
              Land/Atmosphere/Ice Interactions (LAII) element of the Arctic                  
              Systems Science (ARCSS) program, and data required for modeling                
              and process studies by ARCSS scientists. The goal of the project               
              is to provide a central access point for the archiving and                     
              distribution of data. A central focus will be the development of               
              strategies for improved data access and data interfaces with                   
              other national centers, and programs within other Federal                      
              agencies.
