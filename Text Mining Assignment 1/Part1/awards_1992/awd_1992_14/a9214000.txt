Abstract    :
                   Alfven waves are ubiquitous in space plasmas and their                    
              signatures have been observed by many spacecraft under a variety of            
              conditions.  A large amount of theoretical work and computer                   
              simulations deal with them directly or indirectly although there               
              have been a disproportionately small amount of laboratory                      
              experiments in this area.  The reason for this is the lack of                  
              laboratory plasma sources in which clean, and detailed studies of              
              these waves can be performed.  Recently, a machine has been                    
              constructed at UCLA which features a 10m long, 50 cm diameter                  
              plasma column.  The machine can be operated in a regime of moderate            
              density, highly ionized (99%) He or H plasmas in a uniform axial               
              field of up to 2.5 kG.  We propose a series of experiments to                  
              verify that we can launch and detect Alfven waves, and then                    
              diagnose them with a sate-of-the-art data collection and                       
              visualization system.
