Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This project involves the dissertation research of an                          
              anthropological linguist studying how Japanese people born                     
              between 1926 and 1935 talk about modern history, specifically                  
              world war II and the aftermath.  The project will use standard                 
              methods of discourse analysis, including the recurrent emotive                 
              lexicon, the use of intensifiers, and the analysis of other forms              
              of speech, to examine how people incorporate emotional overtones               
              into their stories.  Twenty males and 20 females will be audio-                
              taped in extensive interviews on their recollections.                          
                                                                                             
              This research is important because Japan is a major world trading              
              partner, and increases in our understanding of Japanese cultural               
              models of recent modern history can help us deal with Japanese                 
              reactions to current events.
