Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The Cassegrain infrared array camera currently in use on the                   
              Palomar 200-inch telescope is to be upgraded by purchasing and                 
              installing a new, state-of-the-art, infrared array.                            
                                                                                             
              The current camera has been in service as a major instrument of the            
              200-inch telescope since 1988, and has been used approximately 90              
              nights/year during that time on a variety of scientific topics.                
              The existing camera array is, however, becoming obsolete in                    
              comparison with arrays now commercially available.  For this reason            
              the camera is to be fitted with a new InSb detector array.                     
                                                                                             
              The new array can be incorporated into the existing camera with a              
              small amount of physical modification to the existing camera, new              
              read-out electronics, and new software to read the array.  The vast            
              majority of the investment in hardware and software that has gone              
              into the current infrared camera system will be usable with the                
              modified camera.                                                               
                                                                                             
              The new infrared sensor will increase the number of picture                    
              elements (pixels) by more than a factor of 16, will increase the               
              solid angle of the camera by a factor of 3, and will improve the               
              noise performance of each pixel by a factor of 7.  Th gains in the             
              scientific return from the Palomar camera will come in the                     
              following areas:  increased field of view, increased sensitivity,              
              improved cosmetics, and increased sampling of images and spectra.              
              With these gains the science return from the camera, in studies                
              ranging from searches for protogalaxies to diffraction limited                 
              imaging of stars in the process of forming will be vastly                      
              increased.  The upgrading of the camera will enable entire new                 
              classes of problems to be undertaken, and will preserve the 200                
              inch telescope as a premier facility for research in infrared                  
              astronomy.
