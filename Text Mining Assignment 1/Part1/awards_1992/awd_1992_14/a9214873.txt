Abstract    :
                   This project is concerned with learning algorithms and                    
              architectures for artificial neural networks.  The overall goal is             
              improve the learning speed, scalability, generalization power,                 
              robustness, and ease of use of these learning algorithms, and to               
              extend them to cover new kinds of learning tasks.  This work builds            
              upon the PI's earlier work in this area, which has produced the                
              Quickprop, Cascade-Correlation, and Recurrent Cascade-Correlation              
              algorithms.  Cascade-Correlation builds its own network                        
              topology in the course of learning and is much faster than standard            
              back-propagation.  The current project aims to extend these                    
              algorithms to cover a number of new situations: ``online'' learning            
              from a non-repeating stream of training examples, recognition of               
              unclocked, time-continuous signals, and a new form of unsupervised             
              learning.
