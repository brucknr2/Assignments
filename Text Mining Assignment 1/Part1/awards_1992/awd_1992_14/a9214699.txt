              Description:  This proposal requests partial                                   
              support for the 1993 School on Instrumentation                                 
              in Elementary Particle Physics, sponsored by                                   
              the International Committee for Future                                         
              Accelerators (ICFA) and the Tata Institute of                                  
              Fundamental Research (TIFR), Bombay where the                                  
              school will be hosted.  The program includes a                                 
              series of lectures covering many topics in                                     
              particles physics instrumentation that will be                                 
              augmented by "hands-on" participation in six                                   
              laboratory experiments designed to demonstrate                                 
              the material presented.  The opportunity to                                    
              participate in the experiments sets this school                                
              apart from others aimed at the same audience of                                
              graduate students and young Post Docs from                                     
              developing countries.  The 1993 IFCA School is                                 
              the first held in Asia, and it is expected that                                
              most of the 70-80 students will come from the                                  
              Pan-Asian region.  Its goal is to encourage                                    
              young physicists from developing countries in                                  
              elementary particle physics experiments and                                    
              provide them with the knowledge and skills that                                
              will enable them to undertake detector                                         
              development for these experiments.                                             
                                                                                             
              Scope:  The purpose of the school is foster                                    
              initiatives in detector development at the                                     
              participants' home institutions and to initiate                                
              collaborative efforts that involve physicists                                  
              from both technically advanced and developing                                  
              countries.  The goal of increased foreign                                      
              collaboration is timely considering two factor:                                
              1) the ambitious program of detector develop-                                  
              ment in the US during the next decade that is                                  
              linked to the commissioning of the Super-                                      
              conducting Supercollider and 2) the shortage of                                
              trained scientific manpower in the US in the                                   
              field of experimental elementary particle                                      
              physics.
