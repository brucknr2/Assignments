Abstract    :
              This award from the Academic Research Infrastructure Program                   
              will help the Department of Chemistry at the University of                     
              Houston  acquire a new departmental computer system.  The areas                
              of chemical research that the acquisition will impact are the                  
              following:                                                                     
                                                                                             
              1.  Theoretical/computational approach to problems in peptide                  
                  mimetic design and antiviral nucleic acid oligomers.                       
                                                                                             
              2.  Development and application of powerful new methods for                    
                  time-evolving wavepackets describing multiparticle systems.                
                                                                                             
              3.  The refinement of crystallographically determined                          
                  structures using XPLOR and studies of protein dynamics on                  
                  aspartate transcarbamylase.                                                
                                                                                             
              4.  Reaction dynamics in organometallic, solid-state and                       
                  biological areas of chemistry.                                             
                                                                                             
              5.  Exploration of several problems in the areas of molecular                  
                  recognition, binding and reactivity.                                       
                                                                                             
              %%%                                                                            
              The use of mini-supercomputers provides theoreticians with                     
              computing performance equal to that of large mainframe                         
              computers.  Theoretical chemistry computations give a                          
              quantitative description of the energetics and rates of                        
              elementary chemical reactions and also provide a qualitative                   
              understanding of the fundamental factors governing chemical                    
              changes.  Most of these studies would not have been possible                   
              before the acquisition of the mini-supercomputer because the                   
              cost of mainframe computers or the computer time required would                
              have been prohibitive.
