Abstract    :
                   Funds are requested to renovate laboratories                              
              in cell and molecular biology and biochemistry in                              
              the Department of Biological Sciences.  These                                  
              laboratories serve as training and central                                     
              facilities for researchers, students, and                                      
              collaborators.  This modernization will enhance                                
              training programs at all levels.  On the                                       
              undergraduate level, Lehman college is striving to                             
              establish first rate training programs for bright                              
              minority students through active participation in                              
              federally funded programs designed to propel them                              
              into scientific research careers.  The improved                                
              facilities should enable the Department to attract                             
              more such students and, especially, to keep                                    
              minority students in the pipeline leading to                                   
              advanced degrees.                                                              
                   On the graduate level, Master's and Doctoral                              
              programs in biology, particularly the plant                                    
              sciences program, will benefit from up-to-date                                 
              facilities.  With a dwindling group of botanically                             
              oriented departments nationwide, CUNY's plant                                  
              sciences doctoral program, in collaboration with                               
              the New York Botanical Garden will have the                                    
              capacity to engage in more sophisticated                                       
              experimental research.
