Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The objective of this dissertation improvement application is to               
              analyze and compare two areas of the primate prefrontal cortex                 
              (dorsolateral area 10 and orbitofrontal area 13) in a series from              
              all extant hominoid species and two species of monkey brains, with             
              recently developed computerized imaging techniques and advanced                
              statistical sampling methods, along with new staining methods.                 
                                                                                             
              These techniques should provide accurate and reproduceable                     
              information on the architectonics of these parts of the primate                
              brain, including the numbers of neurons in these cortical areas,               
              volume, and vertical structuring.  The working hypothesis is that              
              area 10, associated with many cognitive functions, will show                   
              substantial distinctions, quantitatively and structurally, while               
              area 13, associated with emotional states and responses to social              
              environments, will be more conservative.  Reconstructions of                   
              earlier states will naturally follow if the findings, especially               
              for the more conservative areas, fall into the expected                        
              relationships.                                                                 
                                                                                             
              The work requires travel and collection of additional brain samples            
              (a number are already collected, including some rare specimens),               
              along with subseqent analysis time.  It is a most feasible and                 
              promising project.
