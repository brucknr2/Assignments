Abstract    :
                   The award is to renovate research and                                     
              research training facilities in three structures                               
              at the Nova University Oceanographic Center: the                               
              Schure, Forman, and Mellon Buildings.  Renovations                             
              include installation of fixtures and furnishings                               
              for 8 biological laboratories.                                                 
                   The Oceanographic Center forms a department                               
              level division of Nova University.  Its mission is                             
              to perform quality scientific research and to                                  
              deliver high caliber scientific education.                                     
              Academic responsibilities have increased                                       
              considerably in the past two years: the                                        
              Oceanographic Center faculty is now responsible                                
              for all undergraduate science offerings as well as                             
              graduate programs in Oceanography.  Community                                  
              outreach is also a priority.  New Center faculty                               
              have been added and more are planned to meet the                               
              Center's growing research and education mission.                               
              Most current biological facilities required for                                
              this mission are either inadequate or non-                                     
              existent.                                                                      
                   Renovations will promote faculty and student                              
              research activities.  Improved laboratories will                               
              enhance research efficiency and will allow                                     
              students to become directly involved in active                                 
              research projects.  It is anticipated that                                     
              renovations will attract more and higher quality                               
              undergraduate and graduate students into Nova's                                
              programs in marine and biological sciences.
