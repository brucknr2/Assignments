Abstract    :
                   Infinite Horizon Optimization is the study of infinite stage              
              stochastic and deterministic mathematical programs.  This subsumes             
              a rich and important class of applications including production and            
              inventory control, equipment replacement, optimal search and                   
              capacity expansion.                                                            
                   Within the framework of an infinite dimensional linear space,             
              this project will:  (1) employ best approximations from finite                 
              horizon optimal solutions to force convergence to an infinite                  
              horizon optimum, and (2) construct a theory of duality for the                 
              doubly infinite case to establish necessary and sufficient                     
              conditions for infinite horizon optimality and finite horizon                  
              optimal convergence.
