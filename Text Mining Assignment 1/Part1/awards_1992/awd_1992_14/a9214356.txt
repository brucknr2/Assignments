Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Two modern X-ray diffraction units will replace the present                    
              obsolete (40 years old) X-ray diffractometers in the                           
              Materials Science and Engineering Department at Stevens                        
              Institute of Technology.  These diffractometers will be                        
              housed in the newly renovated Stevens Materials                                
              Characterization Facility, along with state-of-the-art                         
              field emission TEMs and SEMs, and made available to the New                    
              Jersey Technological Community.  One of the diffractometers                    
              will be a limited resolution unit with automatic sample                        
              exchange that will be used for undergraduate instruction in                    
              Steven's computer-oriented courses and for graduate student                    
              training.  The second diffractometer will have a grazing                       
              angle thin film attachment for crystallographic texture and                    
              stress analysis of thin film materials and will be                             
              dedicated for research on the crystallization of thin film,                    
              electrochemically deposited coatings, tribochemical                            
              reactions in ceramics, and the chemical vapor deposition of                    
              ceramic coatings and superconducting materials.  The                           
              availablity of the new X-ray diffraction equipment will                        
              improve data acquisition and enable improved quantitative                      
              analysis.  Finally, the proposed new equipment will have                       
              the most modern safety equipment, thereby insuring the                         
              safety of students using the Material Characterization                         
              equipment.
