Abstract    :
              A high resolution field emission scanning electron                             
              microscope equipped with a cryotransfer/state system and a x-                  
              ray microanalyzer is needed for investigators in biological                    
              and related sciences at Cornell University.  The                               
              instrumentation will be used in a wide range of projects in                    
              agriculture, biology and related sciences, and will be                         
              located in the Bradfield Hall Electron Microscopy facility                     
              under the responsibility of the Principal Investigator who                     
              is also the director of  the facility.  The 15 year old                        
              conventional scanning electron microscope AMRAY 1000,                          
              currently in the facility, cannot meet the specifications                      
              needed for use in the proposed projects.  While the                            
              instrumentation is necessary for the proposed projects, it                     
              should also benefit other research projects in the campus                      
              that may need high resolution SEM imaging of  biological                       
              specimens or the capability to examine frozen-hydrated                         
              specimens.  The training/teaching program that is currently                    
              i n place at the Bradfield Hall facility should make the                       
              state-of-the-art equipment readily available to a wide body                    
              of researchers including the faculty members, postdoctoral                     
              associates, graduate students, undergraduates and                              
              technicians.
