Abstract    :
                   Carleton College proposes to renovate research                            
              space in Mudd Hall for the Departments of Chemistry                            
              and Geology. The remodeling of the chemistry                                   
              facilities will provide new labs devoted to                                    
              research in physical, organic, inorganic and                                   
              analytic chemistry, and biochemistry.  In addition,                            
              instrument rooms and  hazardous waste storage will                             
              be reconfigured.  The result will be a logical and                             
              efficient arrangement of research space which will                             
              noticeably enhance the department's research                                   
              program.  All seven chemistry faculty members                                  
              maintain active research programs and work together                            
              with about two dozen students per year.  Each year                             
              Carleton graduates about 25 to 30 students with                                
              chemistry majors.                                                              
                   The renovation of the geology research                                    
              facilities will result in a room dedicated to                                  
              computers, a modernized geochemistry lab with                                  
              proper ventilation and storage, a dedicated rock                               
              preparation room, and a properly ventilated area                               
              for x-ray machines.  The renovation will have a                                
              significant impact on the research of 3 faculty and                            
              the 20 plus geology seniors who conduct independent                            
              research projects each year.
