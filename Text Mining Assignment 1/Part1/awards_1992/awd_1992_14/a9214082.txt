Abstract    :
              The MicroElectroMechanical Systems                                             
              (MEMS) or Micro System Technologies                                            
              field is one of the most exciting                                              
              technologies to be developed since                                             
              the integrated circuit.  Already                                               
              identified as a critical technology                                            
              of national importance, the MEMS                                               
              area is attracting the interest of                                             
              engineers and scientists in this                                               
              country.  Research in industry (very                                           
              little at present), government

              universities is starting to grow as                                            
              evidenced by the ongoing work at the                                           
              University of California - Berkeley,

              Georgia Tech, and Cornell.  This                                               
              effort coupled with newly formed                                               
              research centers such as the Center                                            
              for Advanced Microstructures and                                               
              Devices (CAMD) at Louisiana State                                              
              University - Baton Rouge, and the                                              
              Institute for Micromanufacturing

              objective of this proposal is to                                               
              enhance the development of the MEMS
