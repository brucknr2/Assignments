Abstract    :
                   Effective use of quantitative information from manufacturing              
              processes of integrated-circuits (IC) is crucial in monitoring                 
              process potentials, identifying optimal settings, and improving the            
              quality in general.  Although process yield is the primary concern             
              in the IC manufacturing industry, spatial dependence among chips               
              on a wafer provides an opportunity to learn more about the process.            
              Design of experiments has been proven to be effective for examining            
              numerous factors simultaneously in industrial processes.  The major            
              objective of this project is to investigate the impact of factorial            
              experiments on both yield and spatial dependence, especially when              
              the outcome of each chip is coded as either good or bad in routine             
              testing.                                                                       
                   This project will begin by studying log-linear models that are            
              successfully implemented in the social sciences and biomedical                 
              research.  This class of models will be adapted to incorporate both            
              yield effects and spatial effects under factorial experimentation              
              (more recently referred to as Taguchi experiments).  Proper use of             
              this model provides an opportunity to better understand the IC                 
              manufacturing process.  In addition to incorporating design of                 
              experiments for quality improvement in IC manufacturing, the                   
              approach will be compared with some existing techniques in yield               
              modeling.
