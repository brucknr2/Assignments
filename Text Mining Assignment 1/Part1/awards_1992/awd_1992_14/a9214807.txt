Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Washington College request support from NSF for connection of                  
              their campus network to SURAnet.  SURAnet is the midlevel network              
              located in the southeastern United States.  It will provide                    
              operations management and information services and it will give                
              Washington College a 56 thousand bits per second connection to                 
              the NSFNET, a high speed (1.5 - 45 million bits per second)                    
              National Backbone network.                                                     
                                                                                             
              The University needs greater functionality and network speed to                
              be able to access supercomputers, libraries, and make file                     
              transfers along with being able to implement a more reliable mail              
              system. Students and faculty research will benefit from the link.              
              This is also a unique opportunity for the school to explore                    
              innovative educational resources.***//
