Abstract    :
                   The Committee on biopsychology at the                                     
              University of Chicago spans the Division of Social                             
              and biological Sciences and has provided national                              
              leadership for the discipline since its inception.                             
              The Committee studies behavior and its bi-                                     
              directional interaction with neural and endocrine                              
              mechanisms and its ecological and evolutionary                                 
              context.  The strength of the committee derives                                
              from bringing all three levels of analysis together                            
              as an integrated system, including mental processes                            
              and integrative physiological systems other than                               
              the brain.                                                                     
                   This degree granting Committee is unique in                               
              the nation because it combines the biopsychology of                            
              humans with the biopsychology of animals.  The                                 
              University of Chicago is the only university to                                
              provide both graduate and undergraduate training in                            
              behavioral neuroscience and endocrinology and this                             
              award enables them to renovate their research and                              
              research training space in this important research                             
              area.
