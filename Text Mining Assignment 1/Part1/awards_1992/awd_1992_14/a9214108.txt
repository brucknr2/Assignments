Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This two-year award supports U.S.-Sweden cooperative research                  
              in computer and computation theory between Andrzej                             
              Proskurowski of the University of Oregon and Stefan Arnborg of                 
              the Royal Institute of Technology, Stockholm, Sweden.  The                     
              principal objective of this project is the development of efficient            
              algorithms for hard optimization problems restricted to partial k-             
              trees.  The class of partial k-trees includes most of the important            
              families of graphs with an underlying tree structure. This research            
              focuses on the practical aspects of recognizing partial k-trees and            
              finding tree representations.                                                  
                                                                                             
              Dr. Proskurowski brings to this collaboration his expertise in                 
              algorithmic graph theory.  This is complemented by Dr.                         
              Arnborg's background in logic. They propose to address                         
              deficiencies in current graph theory through their work on a                   
              graph reduction system, including implementation of related                    
              algorithms, and by establishing algorithms for obstruction sets.               
              They will also investigate the streamlining of algorithms in                   
              solving distance-related discrete optimization problems.  Their                
              combined and complementary expertise and efforts could lead to                 
              new, fast, practical algorithms for difficult optimization problems.
