Abstract    :
                 This proposal is to study the interaction of mRNA and an                    
              associated protein, com.  The mRNA and the protein will first be               
              purified and characterized individually by a series of                         
              biophysical techniques, including chemical and enzymatic                       
              susceptibility, 2-dimensional NMR and fluorescence.  The                       
              interactions between the mom RNA and the com protein will then be              
              investigated.  These interactions allow the mRNA to be                         
              translated, and will add to understanding of RNA-protein                       
              structure-function relationships.

              Before mRNA is translated, it bind to a protein called com.  This              
              interaction changes the structure of the RNA to allow access to                
              the site where initiation of translation occurs.  The RNA and                  
              protein will be studied independently by a variety of techniques,              
              then combined and re-examined as a complex.
