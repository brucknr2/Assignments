Abstract    :
              This is a proposal to purchase a 300 MHz nuclear magnetic                      
              resonance spectrometer.  This is proposed as a part of a                       
              comprehensive upgrade of NMR instrumentation at the College                    
              of Staten Island - City University of New York.  The 300 MHz                   
              widebore instrument will be used primarily for static and                      
              magic-angle spinning solid-state experiments. The equipment                    
              will be operated and maintained by CSI staff for the benefit                   
              of researchers at CSI, Hunter college, and other CUNY                          
              campuses.
