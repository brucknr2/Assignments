Abstract    :
              This is a proposal to purchase a 500 MHz nuclear magnetic                      
              resonance spectrometer.  The spectrometer will be used to                      
              study fundamental questions in protein folding and                             
              structure.  Excellent water suppression, as obtained with                      
              modern pulse shaping capabilities, and very good resolution,                   
              are necessities.  The projects include investigations of the                   
              structure of protease inhibitor-protease complexes, the                        
              interaction of nucleic acids, and the relationship between                     
              protein motions and the rate constants of biological                           
              electron transfer.
