Abstract    :
                   The proposed renovation of the science                                    
              laboratory will provide a modern, safe and                                     
              attractive facility for research and research                                  
              training for undergraduate women science majors                                
              and science faculty.  The renovated area (1660 sq.                             
              ft.) will provide more laboratory tables and                                   
              sinks, a greater number of hoods, ample space for                              
              laboratory instruments, a safety center, updated                               
              chemical storage and waste collection areas, and                               
              good overall ventilation - all of which are                                    
              critical to an undergraduate research laboratory.                              
              Further, renovation of the tissue culture and                                  
              microbial culture areas will greatly reduce                                    
              contamination and stimulate biochemical research.                              
              The renovated laboratory meets the research needs                              
              of the five full-time and three part-time science                              
              faculty in Biology and Chemistry.  Projects                                    
              include inorganic synthesis, electrochemistry,                                 
              catalysis, enzyme structure and function, data                                 
              acquisition protocol and microcomputer                                         
              applications for chemical analysis, molecular                                  
              biology of senescence, control of carotenoid                                   
              synthesis in citrus fruit, microencapsulation of                               
              chemicals for controlled release systems,                                      
              nutritional studies of microbes, and development                               
              of pesticide resistant plants.                                                 
                   This project will create an exciting and                                  
              stimulating environment where young women,                                     
              especially minority young women, can develop their                             
              confidence and potential as scientists and                                     
              encourage them to consider science and engineering                             
              careers.
