Abstract    :
                   This project, submitted under the Academic Research                       
              Infrastructure Program, will support research instrumentation for              
              the School of Mathematics at the Institute for Advanced Study in               
              Princeton, New Jersey.  As shaped by the developing interests of               
              its faculty over the years, the School of Mathematics has been                 
              primarily concerned with five broad areas: topology; analysis and              
              global analysis; Lie groups, algebraic groups, automorphic                     
              functions and number theory; algebraic geometry; and logic.  In                
              recent years, there has also been growing emphasis on                          
              mathematical physics, dynamical systems, and nonlinear analysis;               
              in 1991-92, there was a special focus on computational fluid                   
              dynamics.  These emerging interests have increased needs for                   
              access to advanced computing facilities.  The project will                     
              support the acquisition of advanced computing resources.
