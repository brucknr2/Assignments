Abstract    :
                   This project will carry out basic research in                             
              mathematical physics on topics in the area of statistical                      
              mechanics and quantum mechanics with emphasis on the effects                   
              of quenched disorder and critical phenomena.  The topics to be                 
              studied include:  spectral properties of operators with                        
              extensive disorder with the aim of providing a non-                            
              perturbative derivation of localization in higher-than-one                     
              dimensional systems; properties of quantum spin systems using                  
              random-walk techniques from classical spin models in the path                  
              integral representation of the quantum propagators; proofs of                  
              universality in the critical behavior for a variety of models.
