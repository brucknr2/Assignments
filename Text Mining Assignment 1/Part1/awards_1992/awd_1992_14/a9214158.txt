Abstract    :
                   Research in photo-nuclear and in fundamental particle                     
              physics will be carried out at the Bates and Saskatchewan cw                   
              electron facilities, at the CERN low energy anti-proton                        
              accumulator ring, and at the BNL AGS facility.  Photonuclear                   
              reactions will concentrate on the role of the nucleon delta                    
              resonance in intermediate energy reactions.  The particle                      
              physics experiments will focus on two areas: (1) sub-ppm                       
              measurement of the muon anomalous magnetic moment at the AGS                   
              as a test of the renormalizability of electro-weak theory,                     
              with interest in the effects of virtual production of very                     
              high mass scale particles including the W and Z bosons; and                    
              (2), measurement of CP violating decay modes of kaons produced                 
              at CERN in proton-antiproton annihilations, with interest in,                  
              among other phenomena, observation of direct CP violating                      
              amplitudes in two-pion decay of the neutral kaon, and                          
              measurement of, or limits on, CP violation in the three-pion                   
              decay channel.
