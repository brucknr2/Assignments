Abstract    :
                   This is the first-year funding of a three-year continuing                 
              award IRI-9214141.  Both rule-based and neural-network approaches              
              have been useful for the development of intelligent systems.  The              
              main objective of this research is to develop a robust machine                 
              learning and inference system by combining these two approaches.               
              A novel prototype system toward this objective has been implemented            
              and tested successfully in a number of practical domains.  The                 
              research project comprises of three parts centering around rule-               
              based connectionist networks.  The first is to investigate an                  
              inductive learning method which combines neural learning and                   
              symbolic artificial intelligence techniques.  The second is to                 
              investigate the knowledge-based neural network approach for                    
              revising existing knowledge and learning new knowledge.  The third             
              is to investigate an incremental rule-based connectionist model for            
              machine learning.//
