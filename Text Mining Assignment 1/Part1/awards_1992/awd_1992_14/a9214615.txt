Abstract    :
              Replacement instrumentation is proposed for campus-wide                        
              research and student training on the St. Paul campus of the                    
              University of Minnesota.  The TEM replacement sought is an                     
              analytically configured TEM with microprocessor controls,                      
              electronic image capture and analysis capabilities, and a                      
              light element detector and analyzer.                                           
                                                                                             
              On-going student training and research capabilities would be                   
              greatly enhanced by state-of-the-art instrumentation.                          
              Current research efforts, with state and national                              
              priorities, benefiting immediately from the proposal are:                      
              a) Soil chemistry and physics related to atmospheric acid                      
              deposition and pesticide residues; b) Wood decomposition and                   
              bioprocessing of lignin removal for paper product; c)                          
              Nitrogen fixation by plants to reduce fertilizer needs; d)                     
              Forest water quality and applied ecology; e) Development and                   
              disease resistance in plants; and, e) Food quality and                         
              structure research.
