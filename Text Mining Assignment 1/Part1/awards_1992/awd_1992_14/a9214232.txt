Abstract    :
              This dissertation study focuses on the character of production                 
              strategies in 10th to 14th Century Iceland in the context of                   
              foreign exchange, ecological succession and climatic change. Field             
              ethnography and other Icelandic research on agriculture will be                
              used to carry out a problem-oriented analysis of Medieval documents            
              on livestock production. This research will provide a valuable                 
              critical analysis of historical data relating to the effects of                
              climate change and socioeconomic transformations over time.
