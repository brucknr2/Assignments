Abstract    :
                   The Department of Chemistry at the University of North                    
              Carolina at Chapel Hill is requesting funds for the purchase of                
              picosecond laser equipment and ancillary electronic and optical                
              devices.  These acquisitions will supplememt present research                  
              capabilities for a multiplicity of programs requiring picosecond               
              time resolution, for example, transient absorption, dynamics of                
              photo-driven events and characterization of nonlinear optical                  
              properties of materials.                                                       
                                                                                             
                  Included in the research proposed with this equipment are:                 
                                                                                             
              1) Light induced electron and energy transfer in transition metal              
              complexes.                                                                     
              2) Directed electron and energy transfer in peptide assemblies.                
              3) Electron transfer rates in polymeric solvents: slow solvent                 
              dipoles.                                                                       
              4) Glasses of polymeric layered ultra-structure for optimum                    
              nonlinear optical responses.                                                   
              5)  Characterization of  short-lived unsaturated organometallic                
              complexes using transient absorption spectroscopy.                             
              6) Multiphoton ionizationn via short lived Rydberg states and real             
              time dynamics in weakly bound complexes.                                       
                   The system will be available to all members of the UNC                    
              scientific community.  The instruments requested will all be                   
              conjoined with picosecond equipment assembled in the Department's              
              Laser Laboratory, a multiuser facility operating since 1975.                   
              %%%                                                                            
                   Picosecond laser spectroscopy is a method for studying the                
              very rapid ( 1/1,000,000,000,000 of a second) molecular processes              
              that occur in chemical reactions and chemical dynamics.  Such                  
              studies give one accurate information about the step-by-step                   
              details of how a chemical reaction proceeds and often give                     
              information about how a chemical process can be altered in order to            
              give different products or make a given process more efficient.
