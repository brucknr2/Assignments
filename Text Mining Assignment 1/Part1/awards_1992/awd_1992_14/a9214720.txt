Abstract    :
              Investigators from Morris Brown College, an undergraduate                      
              institution, propose to purchase a liquid scintillation                        
              counter for biological research, particularly in areas of                      
              microbiology and cell biology.  The instrumentation will be                    
              used in studies of  Tetrahymena and cultured eukaryotic                        
              cells, among other topics.  The instrumentation will also                      
              contribute extensively to the training of students in                          
              biological and environmental research and technology.
