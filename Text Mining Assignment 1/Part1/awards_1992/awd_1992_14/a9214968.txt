Abstract    :
              9214986  Carpita  This award supports Professors Nicholas Carpita and  Robert
              Dunkle of Purdue University, and students in their  research groups, to
              collaborate in cellular biology  research with  Professor Hans Hohl and Dr.
              Robert Dudler  of the Institute of Plant Biology of the University of  Zurich,
              Switzerland.  They are studying some fundamental  microscopic aspects of plant
              cell structure that change  as the cells respond to unfavorable environmental
              stress.   The combined talents of the U.S. participants in protein 
              biochemistry and plant pathology and the German  scientists' expertise in
              cytology and genetics create an  unusually strong team to work on understanding
              the  intracellular processes in stressed plants.    Plant cells have membranes
              inside them adjacent but not  connected to the cell walls that react to some
              types of  stress by adhering to the cell walls.  These  investigators are
              attempting to understand the mechanisms  for that adhesion by examining the
              individual protein  constituents of the membrane-wall adhesion complex.  By 
              characterizing the components, they will obtain  information necessary for
              understanding the adhesion  process, and perhaps controlling it in useful ways
              to  improve plants' reaction to saline stress and pathogen  attack.  ***
