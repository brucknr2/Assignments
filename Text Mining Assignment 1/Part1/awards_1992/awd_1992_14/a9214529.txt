Abstract    :
                   This Award will renovate the space of a                                   
              materials processing laboratory to meet with                                   
              standards of an Advanced Electronic Packaging                                  
              Facility for the fabrication and characterization                              
              of electronic and optoelectronic packages and                                  
              materials.  Electronic packaging is considered to                              
              be a critical area where a significant increase in                             
              research and research training output is needed to                             
              maintain the strength of the U.S. in the 1900's                                
              and beyond.  The proposed facility will be an                                  
              integral part of the Industry-Cornell University                               
              Alliance for Electronic Packaging, a unique                                    
              alliance between Cornell University and a diverse                              
              set of companies including IBM, Digital Equipment,                             
              Carbonundum, and AMP.   Its mission is to perform                              
              both basic and pre-competitive direct research to                              
              achieve world-wide leadership in electronic                                    
              packaging.  Electronic packaging research at                                   
              Cornell is also supported by the Semiconductor                                 
              Research Corporation which is a consortium of U.S.                             
              companies organized to sponsor research in the                                 
              universities to enhance the competitiveness of the                             
              U.S.  The research activities supported by the                                 
              Alliance and the SRC are currently growing in five                             
              key areas: architecture and design, interconnects,                             
              materials and thin films, optoelectronics, and                                 
              thermal management.
