Abstract    :
              The objective of this research is to delineate and quantify the                
              physical interactions or linkages between atmospheric,                         
              terrestrial and aquatic systems in the Arctic. Hydrologic and                  
              meterologic data from the North Slope of Alaska will be                        
              synthesized and incorporated into a numerical model that                       
              describes pathways of mass and energy between systems. This                    
              modeling work will be augmented with field data on stream flow,                
              nutrient movement and energy fluxes at system interfaces. The                  
              proposed models will offer new insights into land-surface                      
              feedback processes within the Arctic system.
