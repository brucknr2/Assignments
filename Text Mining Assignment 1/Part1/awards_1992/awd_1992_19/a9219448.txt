Abstract    :
                   This project will support an Algebraic Geometry Program for               
              Women Students, to be held at the Mathematical Sciences Research               
              Institute (MSRI) in Berkeley, CA from May 17-28, 1993.  A group                
              of fifteen women who are graduate or advanced undergraduate                    
              students will be invited to participate.  Participants in the                  
              Special Year in Algebraic Geometry at the MSRI will give lectures              
              about the subject and their own work.  In addition, a mentoring                
              activity will take place with the purpose of providing further                 
              encouragement to the participants.
