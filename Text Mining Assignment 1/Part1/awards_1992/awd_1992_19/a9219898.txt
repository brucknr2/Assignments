Abstract    :
              This grant will continue to support the construction, and                      
              eventually the operation and analysis of data, of a powerful multi-            
              channel lidar (light radar) at South Pole Station.  The main                   
              observational capabilities are:                                                
                                                                                             
              1.   Complete characterization of polar stratospheric clouds                   
                   (PSC's) throughout the Antarctic winter and spring.  This is              
                   of great importance in understanding the stratospheric ozone              
                   hole.                                                                     
                                                                                             
              2.   Measure the temperature profile from 2 to 70 km using Raman               
                   and Rayleigh techniques.                                                  
                                                                                             
              3.   Observation of polar mesospheric clouds during the Antarctic              
                   summer.                                                                   
                                                                                             
              4.   Measurement of the structure and dynamics of the sodium layer             
                   near the mesopause region. (about 90 km altitude)                         
                                                                                             
              The system will be a flexible, general purpose lidar system which              
              will be able to address a number of important and pressing                     
              scientific issues related to global change.
