Abstract    :
              The goal of this proposal is to obtain a picture of a protein and              
              its solvent at atomic resolution and to test how well the average              
              position and mobility of atoms in the structure are modeled by                 
              molecular dynamics calculations.  This can be accomplished                     
              experimentally by determining the protein's vibration and                      
              equilibrium structure using diffraction methods and theoretically              
              by using empirical force fields.                                               
              Crambin is a hydrophobic, plant protein (MW = 4720) that is unique             
              because it diffracts beyond 0.83 A and has 99% of its diffraction              
              data observed at this resolution limit.  This means its structure              
              can be determined free of the usual restraints of protein                      
              refinement.  Although crambin's function is not yet known, it has              
              activity as a local anesthetic.                                                
              The above goal will be addressed using crambin by the following                
              specific means: unrestrained refinement of the crambin model                   
              against the 0.83 A, 130 K and the 0.945 A, 300 K X-ray data;                   
              corefinement of neutron and X-ray data at 300 K; refinement of                 
              crambin X-ray data at multiple temperatures; full-crystal molecular            
              dynamics simulations and comparison with the X-ray structure; and              
              analysis of the methods to predict protein water structure.                    
              %%%                                                                            
              This project provides a unique opportunity to obtain an                        
              experimental picture of a protein molecule, its surrounding                    
              solvent, and its dynamic movement in extremely sharp detail using              
              single crystal X-ray diffraction.  The fine features that are                  
              revealed can be tested against theories that are currently being               
              used to predict and refine the architecture of proteins.  The fact             
              that crystals of crambin are extremely well ordered make possible              
              the determination and testing of these details.
