Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Many cyanobacteria (blue-green algae) produce a yellowish pigment              
              in the sheaths surrounding their cells. We have shown that the                 
              pigment (scytonemin) is an effective sunscreen, shielding the                  
              organism from the damaging effects of ultra-violet (UV) radiation.             
              It is that this protective system evolved during the early periods             
              of life on earth (i.e. the Precambrian) when UV radiation was                  
              higher.                                                                        
                                                                                             
              Over the next three years we will continue to try understand the               
              chemical nature of this pigment, the biochemical steps in its                  
              production, how its quantity is regulated, and to what extent it               
              may work in harmony with other UV-absorbing substances within the              
              cells (i.e. mycosporines). We will experimentally determine the                
              importance of these mycosporine-like compounds with those that do              
              not, and in fact try to determine what other means are used to                 
              survive under high UV radiation by those species lacking                       
              sunscreens.                                                                    
                                                                                             
              This research is particularly relevant now when stratospheric ozone            
              depletion is threatening to increase damaging levels of UV at the              
              earth's surface.
