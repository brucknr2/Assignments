Abstract    :
                   Recent research in the Mojave Desert of California has                    
              defined the Mojave Extensional Belt, a regional zone of                        
              early Miocene-age continental extension, helped understand                     
              the tectonic development of the eastern California shear                       
              zone and its role in accommodating Pacific- North American                     
              plate motion and recognized several Mesozoic                                   
              tectonometamorphic events.  This renewal will attempt to                       
              constrain the initial dip of detachment faulting and several                   
              metamorphic and structural features associated with a fossil                   
              brittle-ductile transition along the detachment.                               
              Additionally, paleomagnetic work will help document the                        
              timing and magnitude of major early Miocene vertical axis                      
              rotations.  Results will address several fundamental issues                    
              in extensional tectonics that involve how deep-seated rocks                    
              reach the surface.
