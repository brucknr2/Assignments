Abstract    :
              This award is to make the very large data sets collected by the                
              antarctic Automatic Geophysical Observatories (AGO's) available in             
              convenient and standardized format to the international team of AGO            
              investigators, including the principal investigators (PI's) of this            
              grant.  The data will also be archived and data summary plots and              
              data sets of key parameters will be provided to the international              
              AGO Data Analysis Facility (ADAF) in Frascati, Italy.                          
                                                                                             
              The research is on ionospheric and magnetospheric phenomena at very            
              high magnetic latitudes, within the polar cap.  One of the PI's                
              will be doing research using the data to study the magnetosphere,              
              particularly solar-wind/magnetosphere interactions, while the other            
              PI will be involving undergraduate students in developing new                  
              techniques and protocols for the archiving, storage and                        
              transferring of very large data sets.                                          
                                                                                             
              This award supports research at Augsburg College, an Undergraduate             
              institution.
