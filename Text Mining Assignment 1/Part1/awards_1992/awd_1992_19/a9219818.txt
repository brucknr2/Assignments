Abstract    :
              This award is for support for a project to develop a data base from            
              which regional metamorphic, deformation, and age relations of high-            
              grade basement metamorphic rocks in the Transantarctic Mountains of            
              Antarctica can be better understood.  The rocks to be examined come            
              from the Nimrod Group in the central Transantarctic Mountains and              
              the Lanterman Metamorphic Complex in northern Victoria Land.                   
              Improved documentation of their petrogenesis, age, and tectonic                
              evolution are important for a thorough understanding of how the                
              paelo-Antarctc craton evolved and how the supercontinent Gondwana              
              formed.  This study will involve detailed field geologic mapping               
              and sampling, structural, microstructural, kinematic and fabric                
              analysis, metamorphic petrology and quantitative geothermobaro-                
              metry, and Uranium-Lead geochronometry.
