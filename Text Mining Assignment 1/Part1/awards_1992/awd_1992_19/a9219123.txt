Abstract    :
              R1 and R2 are sequence-specific retrotransposable elements found               
              inserted in a fraction of the 28S ribosomal RNA genes of most                  
              arthropods.  The objective of this proposal is to determine whether            
              the remarkable success of these elements is due to their freedom to            
              move from species to species or their ability to remain active in              
              a species lineage over long evolutionary periods.  Most experiments            
              will focus on the sequence relationships of R1 and R2 isolated from            
              species of the dipteran genus Drosophila.  The 3' half of the                  
              elements will be cloned after the polymerase chain reaction                    
              amplification and their nucleotide sequences determined.  This                 
              sequence analysis will be complemented with studies of the                     
              distribution of R1 and R2 within different geographical strains of             
              several species using genomic DNA blotting procedures.  Experiments            
              will also be conducted with three species of parasitic wasp (genus             
              Nasonia) which contain multiple families of highly divergent R1                
              elements.

              The proposed experiments will provide information that is                      
              fundamental to an understanding of the stability of mobile elements            
              within genomes, their ability to transfer between species, and                 
              their ability to regulate their own abundance.
