Abstract    :
              The goal of the proposed research is to elucidate the origin                   
              of high-Mg tonalitic magmas hosted in juvenile crust in                        
              margin-related magmatic arcs.   Understanding processes                        
              leading to the formation of juvenile tonalite is a first-                      
              order problem relevant to the magmatic construction of crust                   
              within orogenic belts.  The proposed study will involve                        
              collection of mineral chemical and whole-rock and isotopic                     
              geochemical data for the Cretaceous Mount Stuart Batholith                     
              of the Washington Cascades.   The project should clarify the                   
              variable roles of high-level magmatic processes (e.g.,                         
              fractionation, assimilation)  so as to better constrain the                    
              variable impact of deeper level processes operative during                     
              melt formation and initial ascent.
