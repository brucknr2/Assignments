Abstract    :
                   North America has the largest archaeomagnetic directional data            
              set in the world, about 5,000 results, but the exact number is                 
              difficult to estimate because the data have been published in a                
              wide variety of (sometimes obscure) publications.  In this project,            
              the North American archaeomagnetic directional and paleointensity              
              data will be collated, and incorporated into a modern,                         
              microcomputer-based, relational data base management system.  This             
              database will be made available to investigators in paleomagnetism,            
              archaeomagnetism, geomagnetism, and archaeology.
