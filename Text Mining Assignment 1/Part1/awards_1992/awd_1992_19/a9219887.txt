Abstract    :
              This project is to determine the origin of magnetite                           
              deposits at El Laco, Chile through a detailed field and                        
              isotopic study.  The results will be used to develop a                         
              genetic and exploration model for the origin of REE-enriched                   
              iron oxide deposits worldwide.  The apparent contrast in                       
              size and tectonic setting of Proterozoic and Phanerozoic                       
              deposits of this class raises the larger issue of tectonic                     
              setting and crustal evolution in the formation of large-                       
              scale mineralizing systems, and relates this project to the                    
              fundamental question of what it is that makes a world-class                    
              ore deposit.
