Abstract    :
              9219043  Frank       The understanding of biological function requires a multi- 
              level approach to the study of structure and a mapping of the  enormous
              complexity in an accessible way.  To this end, tools  must be developed, along
              with an appropriate computational  infrastructure, that are able to visualized,
              match, an d combine  three-dimensional data from different sources (x-ray,
              electron  microscopy (EM) and light microscopy (LM)).  Current  computational
              tools are unable to realized opportunities clearly  opened up by current
              computer technology.  This award will  support the multidisciplinary group of
              investigators to upgrade  the computational environment in such a way that (i)
              it is  suitable for the interpretation of 3D data from various  experimental
              sources; (ii) it facilitates correlative 3D studies;  and (ii) it becomes
              accessible to the biologist.  Among the  systems studies are the ribosome and
              its interaction with RNA;  the mechanism of mitosis; the mechanism of
              excitation-contraction  coupling in the muscle cell  and the interactions
              between  hippocampal pyramidal cells.  The award will support the purchase  of
              a parallel computer, a system of workstations, and the  development of
              corresponding software.  The award is being  supported by the Computational
              Biology Activities and the  Instrumentation and Instrument Development
              programs.  ***
