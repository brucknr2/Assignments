Abstract    :
              9219906  AHRENS, Thomas J.       New shock wave temperature measurements are
              proposed for  olivine compositions in the shock-induced high pressure phase 
              regime.  The PI will measure the melting point of this important  mantle
              constituent.  New techniques are to be developed to conduct  shock temperature
              measurements of sample films of FeO when shocked  into the high-pressure
              metallic phase in order to gain knowledge  of its thermodynamic properties. 
              This component has been proposed  to be a major constituent of the Earth's
              liquid core.
