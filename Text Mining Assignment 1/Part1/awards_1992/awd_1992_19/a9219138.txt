Abstract    :
                   PI will study the timing, magnitude and selectivity of                    
              extinction and origination events associated with a major turnover             
              episode in Caribbean reef coral fauna.  Project will entail:  1)               
              making extensive collections in late Miocene to Pleistocene                    
              sections, Costa Rica, Jamaica, Curacao; 2) dating the sections                 
              using microfossils, paleomagnetics and Sr isotopes; 3) identifying             
              specimens by morphometrics.  Differential taxonomic and ecologic               
              components will be compared to evaulate differential susceptibility            
              to extinction and identify possible causes.  Results will have                 
              important implications for extinction studies and for conservation             
              strategies for modern tropical reef biotas.
