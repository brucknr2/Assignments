Abstract    :
              This award supports an airphoto reconnaissance investigation                   
              of raised beaches in Victoria Land, Antarctica.  The work will                 
              result in a catalog of raised marine features that could                       
              potentially be studied to determine the history of sea level                   
              change since the last glacial maximum.  The history of sea                     
              level change is in Victoria Land is a key element to                           
              understanding the geographic distribution of ice during the                    
              last glacial maximum and to understanding the global water                     
              inventory since this time.
