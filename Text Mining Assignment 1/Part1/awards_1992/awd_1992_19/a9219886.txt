Abstract    :
                   Fluids are involved in nearly all geologic processes,                     
              and are ubiquitous in the continental crust to depths of at                    
              least 10 to 15 km.  As heat is advected by fluid movement,                     
              it may lead to distinctive patterns of thermal anomalies                       
              which can be interpreted to gain insight into fluid pathways                   
              and mechanisms.  Field studies of past and present                             
              temperatures in the Ouachita  Mountains- Arkoma basin area                     
              re proposed to gain insight into the mechanisms by which                       
              fluid flow occurs in the continental crust and the nature of                   
              possible relationships between fluid migrations and                            
              orogenesis.  The Arkoma basin and Ouachita mountains are of                    
              interest because they have been implicated as a source of                      
              the hot brines which apparently flooded North America in                       
              Late Pennsylvanian-Early Permian time (about 300 +25 Ma),                      
              leading to widespread potassic alteration, formation of                        
              Mississippi Valley-type (MVT) lead-zinc deposits, and                          
              possible resetting of paleomagnetic poles.  Mathematical                       
              models will also be used to evaluate various hypotheses                        
              concerning the mechanisms by which fluid flow takes place in                   
              the continental crust.  Modeling will include a study of (1)                   
              temporal focusing of compaction- or metamorphic-derived                        
              fluids, (2) catastrophic release of heat in the crust from                     
              free convection an the interaction of free- and forced-                        
              convective flow regimes, and  (3) the conditions under which                   
              free convection is important in tilted geologic media such                     
              as may occur in sedimentary basins.  Results of the                            
              mathematical modeling will be used in conjunction with data                    
              collected in field studies to evaluate hypotheses concerning                   
              fluid flow in the continental crust, particularly in                           
              reference to tectonically-driven fluid migrations.
