Abstract    :
              This research project addresses several physiological problems                 
              that have emerged from recent studies of diving behavior in king               
              and emperor penguins. Foremost is the seemingly consistent                     
              pattern of both species to make frequent, exceptionally long and               
              deep dives. The emperor penguin is the most suitable species for               
              measuring physiological variables related to breath-hold limits                
              and oxygen management, while diving voluntarily. Some of these                 
              variables are muscle and blood oxygen levels and blood chemistry.              
              The king penguin is most suitable for studies of the effects of                
              compression on gas exchange. Some measurements will be blood                   
              oxygen and nitrogen contents during the course of simulated dives              
              to 200 m. Other experiments will determine the energetic output                
              of diving, the morphological and behavioral development of diving              
              of incipient fledglings and specific measures of foraging                      
              success. The results of this work will be relevant not only to                 
              diving physiology, but will also comprise an essential element in              
              understanding energetics and trophic relationships in the polar                
              ecosystem.
