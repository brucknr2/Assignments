Abstract    :
                This research will investigate the 3-D seismic strain and stress             
              as a function of distance along the San Andreas fault system.  A               
              moving average of the tensoral seismic strain field and state of               
              stress will be computed using the existing seismic network data.               
              Results will be related to detailed fault geometry, rates of creep,            
              temporal and spatial proximity to earlier large earthquakes, and               
              will be compared to numerical models of the fault.  Preliminary                
              results indicate that the principal compression is approximately               
              normal to the fault where rates of creep are high, but oblique to              
              the fault as creep falls off toward the north.  Variation of                   
              tensoral strain components along the fault length appear related               
              to fault ends, but also systematically change as a function of                 
              creep rate.  This research is a component of the National                      
              Earthquake Hazard Reduction Program.
