Abstract    :
                   Topographic uplift is a common feature of collisional                     
              tectonic zone, however the timing of uplift, rates and                         
              changes in rates of uplift are not well known and their                        
              causes poorly understood.  This project will use relatively                    
              newly developed tectonic geomorphology tools to determine                      
              uplift patterns in the Southern Alps of New Zealand, which                     
              are forming from active oblique collision between the                          
              Australian and Pacific plates.  The tectonic interaction                       
              produces  right-lateral and reverse slip across the Alpine                     
              fault, accompanied by spectacular uplift.  The project would                   
              investigate uplift by  mountain front pattern-discrimination                   
              approaches, examine faulted river terraces and moraines to                     
              constrain the rate of slip in the late Quaternary, and study                   
              longitudinal profiles of river terraces and channels within                    
              the western Southern Alps to seek evidence of systematic                       
              knickpoint development and terrace divergence from the                         
              modern channel.  Results should provide a firmer neotectonic                   
              framework for testing geodynamics of orogenesis.
