Abstract    :
              To provide insight into the substrate specificity, catalytic                   
              mechanism and structure of a proteolytic enzyme, mutant trypsins               
              will be generated using current methods of protein engineering.                
              Two general approaches are used to alter the enzyme: 1) targeted               
              substitutions followed by analysis of the variant enzyme 2) region             
              specific substitutions coupled with a genetic selection\screen.  In            
              each case, mutants of trypsin are generated according to structural            
              and/or functional principles to 1) understand the specificity and              
              catalytic power of the enzyme and 2) use our understanding to alter            
              the activity of the enzyme in a predictable fashion.  Variant                  
              enzymes are designed, isolated and purified, and their kinetic                 
              parameters compared with the native enzyme.  Selected mutants are              
              then chosen for more detailed kinetic, theoretical and 3-D                     
              structure analysis.  Results from the initial modifications will               
              provide a basis for introducing future amino acid changes into the             
              enzyme.  Initial experiments have been successful in addressing the            
              role of specific amino acids in substrate recognition and catalytic            
              mechanism of the enzyme and in using that information to alter the             
              enzyme activity using designed metal binding sites.  Proposed                  
              experiments involve amino acid replacements of active site residues            
              for studies involving the catalytic mechanism and substrate                    
              recognition.  Variant trypsins are designed by computer modeling               
              based on our current understanding of trypsin and/or its structural            
              and functional relationship to related enzymes such.  Methods are              
              also being                                                                     
              developed to screen large libraries of variant trypsins using                  
              genetic selections and bacteriophage display technologies.                     
              %%%                                                                            
              These studies will contribute to our understanding of                          
              structure/function relationships in the enzyme trypsin and related             
              serine proteases.  In addition, these studies will help provide a              
              framework for the de novo design of enzymes. //
