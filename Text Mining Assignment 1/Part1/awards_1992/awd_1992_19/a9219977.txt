Abstract    :
                 The role of myosin heads in the process of myosin and sarcomere             
              assembly will be investigated.  Work in progress indicates that                
              expression of myosin heads lacking rod sequence disrupts sarcomere             
              organization in the nematode, Caenorhabditis elegans.  Experiments             
              are proposed to define regions of the myosin head responsible for              
              the muscle-disruptive effect and to determine the gate of truncated            
              myosin molecules.  Transgenic nematodes expressing full-length                 
              myosin or myosin head fragments will be produced.  The motility and            
              muscle ultrastructural defects of control and experimental                     
              transgenic worms will be compared.  The smallest myosin fragment               
              which disrupts muscle organization will be characterized.                      
              %%%                                                                            
              The contractile mechanism of muscle tissue consists of two major               
              proteins, myosin and actin, which are arranged (along with other               
              auxiliary proteins) in densely packed, highly ordered arrays termed            
              sarcomeres, such that linear arrays of myosin molecules (the                   
              "motor" for contractile movement, which transduces chemical energy             
              into mechanical energy) move along actin filaments (which serve as             
              the "track"), resulting in shortening of the sarcomere (and hence              
              of the muscle itself).  This project is concerned with the role of             
              the myosin molecules in the assembly of the contractile apparatus.             
              The power of genetic manipulations will be employed to engineer                
              nematodes with myosin molecules bearing mutations at specific                  
              sites, to determine the functional consequence of these specific               
              mutations.  An understanding of the structural requirements for                
              contractile machinery assembly is a necessary prerequisite to                  
              biotechnological applications of biomolecular motors.  Given the               
              high degree of conservation among myosins throughout the animal                
              kingdom, it is expected that the results obtained with the nematode            
              model system will be generally applicable to other animals.
