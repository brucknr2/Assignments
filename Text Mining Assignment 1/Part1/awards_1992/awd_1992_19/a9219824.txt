Abstract    :
              9219824  Rubin         Field observations indicate that zones of inelastic 
              deformation produced at the tips of propagating dikes can be much  larger than
              those produced at crack  tips in laboratory rock  fracture experiments.  This
              is in direct conflict with the concept  that "fracture toughness" is a rock
              property, independent of scale   and loading configuration.  Even at shallow
              depths, rock fracture   in the Earth takes place at sufficiently high confining
              pressure  that standard concepts of engineering fracture mechanics do not 
              apply.  These results have been applied primarily  to interpreting 
              outcrop-scale observations of inelastic deformation produced by  dikes and
              their geologic implications.  This work will extend this  analysis and approach
              to larger scales of deformation, and in  particular to the interpretation of
              earthquakes associated with  magma transport in volcanic regions.  ***
