Abstract    :
              Insect fossils are reliable, sensitive indicators of Quaternary                
              environments, and are especially valuable for delineating intervals            
              of rapid climate change.  In North America, many studies have                  
              focused on the Wisconsin-Holocene transition at ice-proximal sites.            
              The aim of this research is to synthesize and quantify fossil                  
              beetle paleoclimate reconstructions for North America, using the               
              Mutual Climate Range (MCR) method.  This is a quantitative method              
              of analyzing the insect fossil data by establishing the modern                 
              climate range for each species in a fossil assemblage.  MCR                    
              analyses will be applied to all published ice-proximal late                    
              Wisconsin insect records in North America, and will be used to                 
              calibrate the existing data to provide temperature isobar maps for             
              major regions.  The MCR results will be compared with those                    
              established for European faunas and with North American                        
              reconstructions based on palynology.
