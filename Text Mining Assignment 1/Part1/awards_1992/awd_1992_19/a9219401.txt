Abstract    :
              According to the central dogma of molecular biology, the                       
              information contained in the hereditary material, DNA, is passed to            
              proteins via an intermediate molecule called RAN.  Proteins direct             
              the control of most cell functions.  While the overall process of              
              gene expression is understood, the details of the mechanisms                   
              involved in gene expression need clarification.  For example,                  
              intervening sequences (or introns) are extra pieces of information             
              inside genes that are not used to produce the final gene product.              
              The significance of introns inside genes remains to be determined.             
              This project is looking at requirements for splicing , in the                  
              bacterial virus T4, a process that removes introns from RNA during             
              gene expression.  RNA splicing mechanisms are varied, but in all               
              cases, the sequence of nucleotides (chemical subunits of RNA and               
              DNA) is important to the splicing process.                                     
              %%%                                                                            
              In this project, changes in the nucleotide sequence of the introns             
              will be generated by chemical mutagenesis and the effect of these              
              changes on splicing and gene expression will be evaluated.  The                
              overall goal of this study is to use chemically induced changes in             
              the nucleotide sequences of introns to identify particular                     
              nucleotides in the introns important to splicing.  This information            
              will be used to enhance models for splicing mechanisms.
