Abstract    :
                It has been long recognized that the crust upon which the                    
              Cenozoic Andes Mountains are founded have had a complex                        
              tectonothermal history that dates back to the Precambrian.                     
              Testing of the applicability of recent regional theories to                    
              the Chilenia area have been hampered because of  the lack of                   
              a sufficient, up-to-date, structural-petrologic database.                      
              This field project is a pioneering effort that will gather                     
              critical new structural, timing, and petrologic data in this                   
              important area.  Results will have important implications                      
              for the geologic development of South America and for the                      
              reconstruction of Gondwanaland.
