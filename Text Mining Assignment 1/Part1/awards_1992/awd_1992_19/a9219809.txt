Abstract    :
                   The emplacement of large thrust sheets remains as one                     
              the most poorly understood phenomena of tectonics.  The                        
              proposed study will examine the Willard thrust at                              
              spectacular exposures near Logan, Utah, where one is offered                   
              the rare opportunity to view the three dimensional character                   
              of an intact thrust sheet.  Studies will include detailed                      
              mapping, laboratory strain measurement, computer modeling                      
              and microstructural analysis.  Results of this study will                      
              provide important constraints with which to test the                           
              kinematic and mechanical aspects of thrust sheet                               
              emplacement.
