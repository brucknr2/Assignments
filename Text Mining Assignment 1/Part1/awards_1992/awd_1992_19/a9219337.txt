Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This project continues the investigation of the feasibility of a               
              set of country-level indicators of international competitiveness               
              in high technology industries.  This project advances this                     
              investigation by proceeding in two complementary directions.                   
                                                                                             
              -Development of the recommended indicators for approximately 28                
              countries over a four-year period, resulting in two cycles of                  
              indicators suitable for publication in Science & Engineering                   
              Indicators.                                                                    
                                                                                             
              -Pursue improvements of the indicators by exploring alternative                
              formulations, identifying new data sources and determining the                 
              together.
