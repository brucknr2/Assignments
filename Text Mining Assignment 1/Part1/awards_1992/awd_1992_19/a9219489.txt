Abstract    :
                   PI will establish the first systematic analysis of                        
              northern Gondwana (North Africa-Morocco) Devonian nautiloid                    
              cephalopods within the existing conodont and ammonoid                          
              biostratigraphic framework.  These data will provide the                       
              necessary foundation 1) to establish correlation between                       
              four of the major marine groups of the Devonian (nautiloid                     
              and ammonoid cephalopods, trilobites, and conodonts), 2) to                    
              help elucidate the temporal tie to coeval fish (members of                     
              the Placodermi, Chondrichtyes and Osteichthyes) and thus                       
              provide a better understanding of pelagic marine dynamics,                     
              3) to understand more clearly evolutionary perturbations of                    
              Devonian "events" by providing a detailed analysis of a                        
              third group of augment conodont and ammonoid data, and 4) to                   
              allow, for the first time, a definitive comparison to be                       
              made between faunas of that portion of Gondwana juxtaposed                     
              to the southern margin of Euramerica (Baltica + Laurentia)                     
              and those of western Australia and China, the only other                       
              regions of Gondwana with low latitude basins containing                        
              abundant nautiloid cephalopods.  This last aspect is                           
              especially important in the continuing assessment of                           
              paleogeographic reconstructions on the basis of                                
              biostratigraphic and biogeographic data.  This work will be                    
              done in conjunction with ongoing ammonoid projects of                          
              Michael House (Univ. Southhampton, UK) and Thomas Becker                       
              (Free University, Berlin) in North Africa and Australia and                    
              an existing mapping project in the Meseta, Anti-Atlas and                      
              Tindouf regions of Morocco under the direction of the Royal                    
              Maroc Division de la Geologie Generale (Ministere de                           
              L'Energie et des Mines).
