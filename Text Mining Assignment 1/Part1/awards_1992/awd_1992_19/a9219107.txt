Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The fine-scale structure of currents and internal wave field will              
              be measured in the upper 200 m of the Pacific Ocean along a North-             
              South transect (Line P-13) as part of the World Ocean Circulation              
              Experiment (WOCE). The measurements will be made with a newly                  
              developed coherent Doppler current profiler and a very accurate                
              navigation system. This study will provide an exciting snapshot of             
              the upper 300 m showing the importance of wind-driven currents,                
              mesoscale eddies, internal and inertial waves relative to the mean             
              circulation. This novel approach could change the way we view                  
              variability in the upper ocean on a basin-wide scale.
