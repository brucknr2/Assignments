Abstract    :
                   Studies have demonstrated that 238U-206Pb isochrons                       
              derived from carbonate rocks yield dates consistent with                       
              depositional ages despite evidence of diagenesis in the host                   
              carbonates.  The spread of observed isotope ratios in                          
              carbonates is sufficient to give a potential age resolution                    
              of +  1 Ma for the Paleozoic; however, studies to date have                    
              achieved 2o error limits of no better than roughly + 10 Ma                     
              due to scatter about the isochron ('errorchron') beyond what                   
              is attributable to analytical error.  The aim of this study                    
              is to gain an understanding of the causes of this scatter by                   
              studying U-Pb systematics in pristine and near-pristine low-                   
              Mg calcite fossils from the Lower Jurassic and in a number                     
              of well-preserved marine and diagenetic carbonate phases                       
              from the Permian Reef Complex.  The importance of diagenesis                   
              and possible trace phases (Fe oxides, phosphate minerals,                      
              organic matter) will be assessed through the use of                            
              microsampling methods, partial leaching and, as applicable,                    
              the monitoring of a variety of isotopic and chemical                           
              tracers.  A better understanding of the processes that                         
              control l the initial variability of carbonate 238U/204Pb                      
              ratios and that subsequently alter U-Pb isotopic systems                       
              will lead to more reliable and precise carbonate 238U-206Pb                    
              and 207Pb-206Pb isochrons.  The direct dating of carbonates                    
              has immediate application to a number of problems in the                       
              earth sciences, including the calibration of the Phanerozoic                   
              time scale, the dating and correlation of Precambrian                          
              sediments, and the dating of diagenesis.
