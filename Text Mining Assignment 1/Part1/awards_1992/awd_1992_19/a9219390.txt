Abstract    :
                   A unifying theory has recently been developed that                        
              offers a way to determine the relative contributions of pure                   
              and simple shear to the total strain in the rock even when                     
              traditional strain markers are absent.  It can explain micro-                  
              and meso-scale structures, including shear bands, forward                      
              and back-rotated boudins, and other features that were                         
              previously thought to be contradictory.  This project will                     
              extend the theory by calculating the trajectories for                          
              deformable ellipsoidal porphyroclasts of varying viscosity                     
              contrast to their matrix.  The theory will be tested using a                   
              suite of samples from shear zones in well-established                          
              tectonic settings.  The establishment of the proposed                          
              methodology as a standard technique for structural analysis                    
              should have wide application.
