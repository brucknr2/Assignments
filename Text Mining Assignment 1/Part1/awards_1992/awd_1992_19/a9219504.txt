Abstract    :
              The proposed research is designed to study the atomic level                    
              structures and dynamic properties of liquids and glasses in                    
              the system CaO-MgO-Al2O3-SiO2, using a combination of NMR                      
              and vibrational (IR and Raman) spectroscopies, and molecular                   
              dynamics simulations.  The main objective of this work is to                   
              characterize the variation in number and type of atomic                        
              configurations, especially the Si and Al coordinations, and                    
              to examine next-nearest neighbor environments present in the                   
              liquids as a function of composition and temperature.  This                    
              study should increase understanding of the temperature- and                    
              composition-dependent behavior of natural magmas during                        
              igneous processes.
