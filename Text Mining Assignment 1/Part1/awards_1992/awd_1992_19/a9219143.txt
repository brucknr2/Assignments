Abstract    :
              This award supports a study of carbon isotopic compositions of                 
              benthic foraminifera from Eocene to Oligocene sediments from Ocean             
              Drilling Program sites 689 and 690 on the Maud Rise of the Southern            
              Ocean.  The analysis of paired species (epifaunal-infaunal) will be            
              used to establish a record of paleoproductivity and will be                    
              corroborated with organic carbon, biogenic silica, total benthic               
              foraminiferal number and total sediment accumulation rates.  The               
              paleoproductivity data from these high-latitude sequences will be              
              compared with existing planktonic foraminiferal isotope data to                
              determine how productivity changes are related to the evolution of             
              Southern Ocean paleoclimate conditions.  This information will be              
              useful for evaluating the role of productivity changes on climatic             
              conditions over long periods of geologic time.
