Abstract    :
              9219777  Schultz       This award provides 62% of the funds required for the 
              acquisition of a portable ground-penetrating radar (GPR) system  that will be
              operated in field research and teaching projects by  members of the Department
              of Geological Sciences at Brown  University. Brown University is committed to
              providing the  remaining funds necessary for the purchase of the equipment.    
                The GPR system is capable of producing images of the shallow  subsurface
              (down to depths of several tens of meters) with image  resolution of several
              tens of centimeters in the vertical and  horizontal direction. The GPR system
              will be used initially by the  Principal Investigator to image the stratigraphy
              under the Rio  Cuarto crater field in Argentina which was produced by the low- 
              angle "grazing" impact of a meteorite. The GPR system will also be  used in the
              Department's courses in geophysics.  ***
