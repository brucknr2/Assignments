Abstract    :
              This award is for support of a study of cosmogenic in-situ produced            
              carbon-14 in polar ice.  Carbon-14  produced in-situ has a                     
              signature which is distinct from the trapped atmospheric carbon-14,            
              and can be used as a tracer for ice accumulation/ablation processes            
              and rates.  Work carried out under a previous grant established                
              that an appreciable amount of in-situ carbon-14 is retained in                 
              firn, and therefore conventional carbon-14 compaction ages can be              
              considerable underestimates since they do not consider the in-situ             
              component.  This study will examine samples from several ice cores             
              from the Antarctic, including Vostok, the Dominion Range, McMurdo,             
              South Pole, Allan Hills and the Adelie Coast.
