Abstract    :
                   Thermodynamic and Kinematic aspects of the formation and                  
              transport of silicate liquids in the Earth's deep interior are                 
              critically dependent on the equations of state of both the liquid              
              and solid components.  The range of liquid silicate compositions               
              that have been studied at significantly high pressures is currently            
              too narrow to allow quantitative evaluation of petrologic theories             
              without also including many rather speculative assumptions.                    
              Additionally, the thermal part of the liquid equations of state is             
              almost completely unconstrained by existing experimental data.                 
              The PI will conduct new molten silicate compression studies using              
              the new 80 mm shock wave facility at the University of Chicago.                
              New target designs and instrumentation strategies will be developed            
              to achieve an order of magnitude improvement in precision.  These              
              changes will eliminate subjective aspects of the data analysis, and            
              will greatly facilitate the determination of the thermal part of               
              the Hugoniot equation of state.
