Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The rapid retrograde degeneration of neurons in the lateral                    
              geniculate nucleus (LGN) following damage to the visual cortex in              
              adult mammals precludes subsequent axonal regeneration and                     
              restoration of function.  In young animals of many species, LGN                
              neurons also degenerate after damage to the visual cortex but, in              
              contrast to adults, some neurons are spared and are able to                    
              establish new pathways resulting in remarkable behavioral                      
              compensation.  Recent evidence suggests that basic fibroblast                  
              growth factor (bFGF) may prevent neuronal death.  However, the                 
              lack of a suitable delivery system for administering trophic                   
              factors or their genes to non-dividing neurons has been a major                
              obstacle in determining their efficacy in vivo.  This Small Grant              
              for Exploratory Research will permit the development of a Herpes               
              simplex viral vector carrying the bFGF gene.  This vector will be              
              used to determine whether the production of bFGF in LGN neurons                
              will prevent their degeneration after damage to the visual cortex              
              in adult rat.  These studies have the potential for improving the              
              technology for gene therapy not only for treating damaged neurons              
              in the visual system, but also neurons affected by damage, disease             
              or genetic abnormality in any system in the mammalian brain or                 
              peripheral nervous system.
