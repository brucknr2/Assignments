Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The project will investigate the cores of galaxies, with the aim               
              of searching for supermassive black holes in the nuclei of                     
              galaxies by looking for large central gradients in rotation                    
              velocities and velocity dispersions.  In another area, an atlas                
              of photographs of dust distributions in early-type galaxies will               
              be published.  There will also be a study of scalling laws for                 
              dark matter halos of galaxies.                                                 
                                                                                             
              The Principal Investigator is an expert in this research area.
