Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The proposed research is directed toward 1) identifying patterns               
              of landscape properties including soil texture; vegetation and                 
              micro- and macro-topography and 2) determining the way in which                
              these patterns influence hydrologic behavior of a semi-arid                    
              catchment in eastern Washington state.  Because variations in these            
              landscape properties occur at various scales, observations of the              
              distributions will be made at scales ranging from field mapping to             
              low-and high-altitude aerial photography.  Spatial analysis                    
              techniques will be applied to mathematically characterize patterns             
              in the distributions of the hydrology-affecting properties.                    
              Patterns at successive scales will then be superimposed in an                  
              effort to determine how the interacting processes and their scale              
              dependencies reflect the basin hydrologic response.  The                       
              distributions of the hydrology-affecting properties on the                     
              landscape will be correlated to measured  hydrologic performance,              
              emphasizing infiltration and soil moisture because runoff is rare              
              in the region.  It is expected that these combinations of patterns             
              at various scales will be reflected in the dynamics of the                     
              hydrologic processes; including infiltration, evapotranspiration,              
              runoff, and recharge.  Description of landscape patterns and their             
              properties at different scales, along with their relationship to               
              hydrologic processes, should provide insight into the mechanisms               
              by which landscape features and hydrologic processes interact.
