Abstract    :
                   Deformational modeling of the south American plate will test              
              the roles of dominantly non-slab processes acting on the plate.                
              The modeling consists of a finite element analysis of deformation              
              within the plate using grids with 1o-5o node spacing, variable plate           
              rheology, and is the first to explicitly include lateral density               
              contrasts in the south American plate.  The study is expected to               
              substantially improve understanding of non-slab forces acting on               
              the South American plate and allow comparisons with the North                  
              American plate and will benefit from recent work on the dynamics               
              of the North American plate.
