Abstract    :
                   The Pacific Northwest and Alaska consists of accreted                     
              terranes, many of which are far-traveled relative to the                       
              North American craton.  Geological relationships and                           
              paleomagnetic constraints on the origin translation,                           
              collision and subsequent movement along the orogen margin                      
              have been worked out for many of the terranes.  The Pacific                    
              margin of the Eurasian plate likely had a similar history,                     
              but little is known about the terranes in the Koryak and                       
              Kamchatka regions of northeastern Russia.  This project is                     
              to analyze paleomagnetic samples previously collected in                       
              conjunction with Russian scientists, and to integrate these                    
              data with literature on the geology of these areas.  Results                   
              will be of interest to Pacific northwest and tectonics.
