Abstract    :
                   This research will develop a new global three-dimensional S-              
              wave velocity model for the upper mantle with lateral resolution               
              of on the order of 1000 km or less.  The new aspect of this project            
              is that it will depart fundamentally from the approach of using                
              little or no a priori information which underlies all recent                   
              seismological tomographic studies.  To better account for the                  
              overwhelming influence of shallow lithospheric velocity                        
              heterogeneity, a regionalized initial model, including topographic,            
              crustal and lithosphere variations will be used in some of the                 
              inversion.  The inversions will include simultaneous determination             
              of source locations and structure using Love and Rayleigh wave                 
              spectral data.  This project will promote multi-disciplinary                   
              advances in the study of plate tectonics, mantle dynamics and the              
              geoid, and petrology and geochemistry of the lithosphere.
