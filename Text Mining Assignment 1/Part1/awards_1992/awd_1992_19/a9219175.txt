Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This research will measure and quantify the hydraulics of flow in              
              soil macropores and the interactions between macropores and the                
              surrounding porous media.  A non-destructive gamma ray tomography              
              unit will be used to obtain water content distributions in                     
              laboratory columns to a resolution of 5 mm during flow events and              
              2 mm after redistribution.  A variety of pore types will be tested             
              which will differ in size and method of formation.  These direct               
              measurements of the temporal and spatially varying soil water                  
              content will allow the calculation of flow hydraulics.  Those                  
              results will in turn, be compared to existing deterministic                    
              theories of macropore flow.  Specific assumptions which will be                
              evaluated are;  1) poiseuille flow within the macropore,  2)                   
              hydraulic equilibrium between the pore and the surrounding porous              
              media, 3) the suitability of modeling the radial sorption of water             
              from the pore as normal horizontal sorption, and 4) the effects of             
              surface seals on the entrance of water into the pore.
