Abstract    :
                This research will analyze earthquake models to explain how                  
              extreme ground accelerations can be expected under certain                     
              circumstances.  Earthquake strong ground motion data recorded over             
              the past two decades have unequivocally shown that ground                      
              acceleration can exceed 1.0 g (one g is the acceleration of gravity            
              at the surface of the earth) and in some cases 2.0 g.  These                   
              accelerations are truly spectacular given that many analyses place             
              smaller limiting values on peak acceleration.  These extreme                   
              accelerations are unusual in that nearby accelerometers do not                 
              simultaneously record similar peak amplitudes.  The extreme                    
              accelerations will be analyzed using a kinematic model of the                  
              earthquake rupture history that incorporates both the distribution             
              of slip and the time dependence of the propagating rupture front.              
              After determining the critical parameters based on the kinematic               
              description of the earthquake, the analysis will be extended to                
              incorporate the dynamics of an earthquake to ensure that the                   
              kinematic models are physically realizable.
