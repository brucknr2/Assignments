Abstract    :
                   Pleistocene caldera-forming silicic volcanism active resurgent            
              domes, extremely high heat flow large earthquakes and unprecedented            
              crustal uplift of 1 m between 1923 and 1975 followed by a reversal             
              to rapid subsidence are properties which reflect the kinematics and            
              dynamics of the Yellowstone volcanic field--now the active element             
              of the Yellowstone hotshot.  From GPS and gravity observations in              
              Yellowstone in 1987, 1989 and 1991, a large area (100 km x 50 km)              
              of the Yellowstone caldera has experienced more than 70 mm of                  
              caldera-wide subsidence which reflects magmatic or hydrothermal                
              fluid migration.  This project will verify this unprecedented                  
              deformation and turn attention to the larger-scale picture of the              
              Yellowstone hotshot within a global framework.
