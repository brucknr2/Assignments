Abstract    :
                   Brittlely deforming material is commonly modeled as a                     
              homogeneous continuum.  In fact, however, the material has a                   
              substructure, characterized by rigid blocks bounded by shear                   
              planes, and the effect of this substructure are not                            
              accounted for by classical continuum theory.  This project                     
              will test and apply a new hypothesis that takes into account                   
              rigid block rotations on slickenline orientations and on                       
              seismic focal mechanism solutions.  The work will compare                      
              the micropolar interpretation of seismic focal mechanism                       
              data from California against existing paleomagnetic and                        
              geodetic data and will also study slickenline patterns in                      
              other areas such as in sheared serpentines on the fault                        
              system in the northern California coast ranges.  Results                       
              should permit a significant test of the theory, which has                      
              the potential of improving current understanding of brittle                    
              deformation.
