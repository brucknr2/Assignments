Abstract    :
                   The Llano uplift and of central Texas records a complex                   
              history of Grenville and Pre-Grenville tectonism that has                      
              not been overprinted by later orogenic events.  This study                     
              will focus on two of the more significant questions                            
              regarding the evolution of this mid-Proterozoic crust:  the                    
              extent of pre-Grenville crust and its orogenic history, and                    
              the timing of Grenville-age regional metamorphism and                          
              deformation.  Results are expected to generate additional                      
              understanding of the nature, extent, and timing of mid-                        
              Proterozoic tectonism along the southern margin of North
