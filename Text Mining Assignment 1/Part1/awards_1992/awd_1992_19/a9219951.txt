Abstract    :
                   Maintaining genetic diversity within an endangered species                
              is an important goal of conservation biology.  However, the                    
              threat of disease to endangered plants has been neglected in past              
                                                                                             
              studies.  Disease may cause plant numbers to decline and\or the                
              disease may reduce the genetic diversity within a population.  An              
                                                                                             
              example is a white rust disease of the Menzies' wallflower,                    
              Erysimum menziesii, an endangered plant restricted to vanishing                
              native dune communities along the northern California coast.                   
              Some populations of the plant suffer from the disease and,                     
              although the wallflower has been the object of extensive                       
              research, the destructive effect of the disease has not been                   
              investigated.  Both ecological and genetic studies are required.               
                                                                                             
              This research will closely examine the relationship between the                
              wallflower and its disease to assess if disease has caused the                 
              plant to become endangered or is keeping the plant from                        
              recovering.  In addition, the genetic diversity within both the                
              plant and pathogen populations will be measured for three years                
              and this will provide an indication if diversity is being                      
              maintained during conservation or if there is any change in the                
              genetic structure.                                                             
              Many aspects of this research are unique.  It is a collaborative               
                                                                                             
              effort between The California Nature Conservancy, a conservation               
                                                                                             
              management organization, and Michigan State University, a                      
              traditional basic research institution.  This partnership will                 
              provide needed cooperative effort between basic science and                    
              applied conservation.  By combining genetic studies with                       
              population monitoring, management options specifically for                     
              Menzies'wallflower will be addressed.  In addition, this approach              
                                                                                             
              will introduce a generalized strategy to assess the impact of                  
              disease on other endangered plants.  The results will provide the              
                                                                                             
              basis for future predictive mathematical models which can be used              
                                                                                             
              to evaluate how specific conservation activities would affect                  
              recovery.  From this, conservationists will be able to choose                  
              between management options.  Included with these applied aspects               
                                                                                             
              is the basic study of plant disease in natural populations.  This              
                                                                                             
              project will expand the discipline by introducing a new type of                
              model system, one with different attributes than those currently               
                                                                                             
              under study.
