Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Five sites in the Palouse Loess of the Columbia Plateau, that each             
              span the last 75,000 yr (the last glacial cycle through the current            
              interglacial), will be mapped in exposures, described, and sampled.            
              The sequence of sites will form a bioclimatic transect from about              
              200 mm to 700 mm precipitation, warm  to cool temperature, and                 
              shrub-steppe to forest.  Tephrochronology, soil stratigraphy, and              
              thermoluminescence dating will provide chronological control and               
              correlation among sites.  The stable isotope geochemistry and                  
              abundances of opal phytoliths and the stable isotope geochemistry              
              of soil-formed calcium carbonates will yield information about                 
              fluctuations in plant cover, plant community type, and temperature             
              through time.  Site stratigraphy and the micromorphology (soil                 
              microscopy), physical, and chemical properties of paleosols will               
              yield interpretations of loess aggradation and erosion cycles, of              
              soil development, and of relationships of changing vegetation and              
              climate to soil-forming processes and landscape evolution.                     
              Measurement of magnetic susceptibility of paleosols and loess will             
              serve as a critical test of the climate proxy model developed from             
              Chinese loess.  The sub projects above will be synthesized into a              
              quantitative descriptive model of change in 5,000 to 10,000 year               
              time slices through the last 75,000 yr.  Two longer stratigraphic              
              sections that date back to 175,000 yr B.P. then will be sampled and            
              analyzed using the same techniques to reconstruct the record of the            
              penultimate glacial-interglacial cycle                                         
              Project goals are to provide direct information on changes in                  
              climate and vegetation, to quantify region-wide responses of the               
              pedologic, sedimentologic, and hillslope-geomorphic systems to                 
              those changes, to further document a losess-based proxy record of              
              activity of the Cordilleran Ice Sheet, and to test several climate             
              proxy records.
