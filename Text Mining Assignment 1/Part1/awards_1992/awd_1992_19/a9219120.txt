Abstract    :
              The purpose of this project is to                                              
              study and document the progression                                             
              and fire behavior, from inception                                              
              to containment, of the now called                                              
              "Tunnel" Fire that occurred in the                                             
              Oakland Hills in late 1991.  It                                                
              will involve basic combustion and                                              
              heat transfer fundamentals,                                                    
              vegetational and structural                                                    
              analysis, and a concise overview                                               
              incorporating all existing records.                                            
              The issues to be addressed are                                                 
              concerned with:  a) the response of                                            
              domestic and wildland vegetation to                                            
              weather and climate such as drought                                            
              and wind, b) the heat transfer                                                 
              processes occurring during the                                                 
              fire, and c) the interaction of                                                
              structural and vegetational fuels                                              
              in fire.  The results of the                                                   
              research will be useful in                                                     
              evaluating the hazards in the                                                  
              urban/wildland interface, the                                                  
              effects on these areas, vis a vis                                              
              the fire risk, of extreme climatic                                             
              and weather events, and the                                                    
              potential effectiveness of                                                     
              mitigation measures being proposed.
