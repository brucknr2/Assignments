Abstract    :
              Alkaline, saline brines in a late Cenozoic rift basin near                     
              Socorro, New Mexico, caused pervasive potassium metasomatism                   
              of volcanic rocks beneath the basin floor as well as of the                    
              synrift sediments.  The objectives of this project are:  1)                    
              to determine the mobility of potential ore-forming elements                    
              during K-metasomatism; 2) to determine where elements                          
              enriched in the altered rocks occur in the alteration                          
              assemblage of adularia, hematite, -_ quartz, _ clay;  3) to                    
              determine the temperature and composition of the fluids by                     
              analysis of fluid inclusions; 4) to determine the stable                       
              isotope composition of the metasomatic fluid; and 5) to                        
              determine the age and duration of the metasomatic event by                     
              40Ar/39Ar dating of secondary K-feldspar. Preliminary                          
              analyses indicate that arsenic may be a mobile element in                      
              the oxidizing hydrologic systems of rift basins and may be a                   
              more common problem than is realized.
