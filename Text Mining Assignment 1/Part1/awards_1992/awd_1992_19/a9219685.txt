Abstract    :
                   The CONCERT Network (Communications for North Carolina                    
              Education, Research, and Technology) is a mid-level network that               
              serves the State of North Carolina.  CONCERT is connected directly             
              to the NSFNET Backbone Network.  It is the intention of CONCERT to             
              offer NSFNET connections to all higher education institutions in               
              North Carolina.                                                                
                   This proposal requests support to establish six new                       
              connections with a special emphasis on community colleges in the               
              state for:  Cape Fear CC, Carteret CC, Central Piedmont CC, Forsyth            
              Technical CC, Guilford Technical CC, and Wake Technical CC.                    
                   A primary goal of CONCERT is to facilitate collaborative                  
              projects and sharing of resources between institution, including               
              those outside the state.  CONCERT will provide operations                      
              management and information services as well as provide appropriate             
              dedicated connections to the six institutions.                                 
                   The universities need greater functionality and network speed             
              to be able to access supercomputers, libraries, and make file                  
              transfers along with being able to implement a more reliable mail              
              system.  Students and faculty research will benefit from the link.             
              This is also a unique opportunity for the schools to explore                   
              innovative educational resources.
