Abstract    :
                   This research is to apply high resolution seismic analysis                
              procedures to resolve possible slow coseismic slip in the rupture              
              of several recent large earthquakes, emphasizing events along the              
              Pacific Coast of North and South America.  The objective will be               
              to understand the nature of deep fault properties, and the role of             
              quasi-static strain changes and creep or viscous flow in causing               
              slow cosseismic slip and aseismic slip before and after large                  
              earthquakes.  Techniques used for study have been developed under              
              previous grants for simultaneous analysis of the broadband spectrum            
              of seismic radiation.  This research is a component of the National            
              Earthquake Hazard Reduction Program.
