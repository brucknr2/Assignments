Abstract    :
                   This award provides funds for the acquisition of an unlimited             
              cpu license to the source code of the GEOTOOLS computer program                
              which integrates state of the art software for interpreting                    
              magnetotelluric (MT) data, a relational data base in standard,                 
              internationally accepted format, and utilities for converting MT               
              data to standard format. The GEOTOOLS program has been adopted as              
              standard by the geophysics research community working in the MT                
              area and is already accessible to workers in Canada and Mexico. The            
              PI will obtain the license at a very substantial educational                   
              discount and will provide it to all interested educational                     
              organizations in the U.S.                                                      
                   The MT community uses natural electromagnetic energy to image             
              internal Earth structure in terms of properties such as electrical             
              conductivity. Analysis of MT data is very computer intensive and               
              progress in the field has been inhibited by diverse data formats               
              that complicate data sharing, by difficulties of visualizing the               
              3-D data, and by the problem of interfacing data with incompatible             
              analysis software programs developed by different groups. Access               
              to the GEOTOOLS program will result in a uniform, flexible MT data             
              analysis environment for all of North America.
