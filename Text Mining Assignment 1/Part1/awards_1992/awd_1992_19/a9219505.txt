Abstract    :
                   PIs will analyze Neogene climatic and depositional evolution              
              of the eastern Basin and Range (US) by integrating paleoecologic,              
              stratigraphic and seismic data from the Great Salt Lake.  Source               
              of material is Amoco and includes cores, cuttings, samples, and                
              seismic lines.  ?PIs have funding from TEctonics program for basin             
              analysis aspects of project.!  Primary objective is to test                    
              hypotheses of climate change recently proposed for Neogene of                  
              western North America by 1) documenting onset and development of               
              cool, dry climate in Neogene, 2) developing chronology through                 
              radiometric dates on tephras and basalts, 3) producing detailed                
              climate record from a single region, for a time now known only from            
              overlapping segments from diverse deposits.  They will also a)                 
              develop a chronology for Neogene evolution of vegetation in the                
              Great Basin, b) produce Neogene paleolimnologic study of GSL, c)               
              study onset and evolution of glacial/interglacial climatic cycles.
