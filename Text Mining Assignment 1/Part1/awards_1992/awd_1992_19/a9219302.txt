Abstract    :
                This research deals with the investigation of relative strengths             
              of oceanic crust at ridges and transforms relative to the remaining            
              oceanic lithosphere by means of seismologically-determined stress              
              drops from earthquakes.  Preliminary results show several                      
              interesting differences in the relative body and surface wave                  
              magnitudes, seismic moments, and source time functions.  These data            
              suggest that with respect to intraplate events, ridge earthquakes              
              are generally "fast" (releasing energy preferentially at short                 
              periods) whereas transform earthquakes are generally "slow"                    
              (releasing energy preferentially at long periods).  Using seismic              
              source models, the investigators have found that these differences             
              are consistent with ridge events having higher stress drops than               
              transform events, which implies a higher strength of the relatively            
              thin crust at ridges.  This research seeks to expand the data set,             
              continue and refine the seismological analysis, and explore the                
              tectonic implications.
