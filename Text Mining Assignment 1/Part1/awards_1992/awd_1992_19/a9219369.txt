Abstract    :
                   The PI will continue quantitative deformation experiments on              
              carefully chosen structural analogues of deep mantle phases and to             
              perform parallel qualitative deformation experiments on silicates              
              of mantle composition.  The analogue experiments will be performed             
              in Griggs-type apparatus at relatively low pressures.  The mantle              
              silicate experiments will be performed at pressures of 14-25 GPa               
              in a multianvil apparatus.  Comparison of the deformation                      
              mechanisms activated in the silicates with those activated in the              
              analogues will provide constraints on the reliability of                       
              extrapolation to mantle conditions of measurements made on the                 
              analogues.
