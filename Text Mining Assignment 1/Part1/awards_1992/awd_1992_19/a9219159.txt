Abstract    :
              This ongoing research has a long-term objective of                             
              developing a systematic body of liquidus phase equilibrium                     
              data on model chemical systems relevant to the origin and                      
              crystallization of the presumed early magma ocean and on the                   
              generation of magmas from the Earth's mantle.   The proposed                   
              projects will utilize piston cylinder and multianvil                           
              techniques to determine the phase relationships that control                   
              the melting behavior of model amphibolite-kyanite-quartz                       
              eclogite at 3 GPa and the melting and crystallization                          
              behavior of  model peridotite at pressures from 7 - 16 GPa.                    
              Results of these studies will directly address aspects of                      
              magma generation at subduction zones and will place                            
              additional constraints on the formation and crystallization                    
              of a presumed early magma ocean.
