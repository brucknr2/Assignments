Abstract    :
                   A broad program of research in theoretical physics will                   
              include work on the quantum mechanics of black holes, the                      
              implications of inflation for the global structure of the                      
              universe, particle physics in the early universe, superstring                  
              theory, supersymmetric phenomenology of unified theories, and                  
              high precision phenomenology of the theory of the weak and                     
              electromagnetic forces. Black hole physics, superstring                        
              theory, inflationary theory of the early universe, and                         
              supersymmetric grand unified theories are at the center of                     
              efforts to push physics to new frontiers at or near the Planck                 
              scale, an extremely high energy where the standard notions of                  
              classical space-time are no longer applicable.  At the same                    
              time, the validity of the standard model of the weak and                       
              electromagnetic interactions and its extensions such as                        
              supersymmetric theories and technicolor must be checked                        
              through high precision analysis of current and future                          
              experimental data.
