Abstract    :
              The proposed research seeks to establish pressure effects on enzyme            
              kinetics as a diagnostic of enzyme mechanism of the same sort as               
              initial rate kinetic studies at constant pressure have been for the            
              last 40 years or so.  Pressure effect studies on formate                       
              dehydrogenase will be correlated with isotope effect studies.  The             
              pressure effect kinetic expressions will be developed and compared             
              with the results obtained with a series of enzymes whose catalytic             
              mechanisms are presumed to be known.                                           
              %%%                                                                            
              Studies of the time-dependence of enzyme-catalyzed reactions as a              
              function of enzyme, substrate, and inhibitor concentration have                
              developed into a paradigm for characterizing catalytic mechanism               
              (ie. the timing of bond-making and bond-breaking events during the             
              converstion of substrate into products).  Understanding of enzyme              
              mechanism is important for developemnt of better substrates or                 
              inhibitors, etc.  Mechanism information is useful for understanding            
              how metabolism works and for the design of drugs and enzyme assays.            
              The study of pressure effects on enzyme catalysis has the potential            
              of developing into another powerful diagnostic of mechanism which              
              is both independent of and complementary to concentration-                     
              dependence studies.  The proposed work could provide revolutionary             
              new insights into enzyme function studies.
