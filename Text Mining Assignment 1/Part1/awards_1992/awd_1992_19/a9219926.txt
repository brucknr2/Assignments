Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Dr. Trant wants to conduct a comparative study of the production of            
              androgen, a male hormone, in the testis of two different species of            
              elasmobranch. Elasmobranchs are vertebrate animals that represent              
              an evolutionary important taxon of fish. Here he will develop                  
              molecular probes as one of the requisite molecular biology                     
              techniques to analyze the enzymes involved. The results of these               
              studies will greatly enhance our understanding in the area of                  
              reproductive endocrinology.
