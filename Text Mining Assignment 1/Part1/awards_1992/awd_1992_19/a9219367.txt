Abstract    :
                This research is to continue study of the long-period seismic                
              response of several idealized isotropic and anisotropic earth                  
              models to determine the observable aspects of anisotropy in the                
              earth's upper mantle.  The initial  calculations suggest that                  
              upper-mantle azimuthal anisotropy of a few percent, spatially                  
              coherent over the length scale of a typical ocean basin, is                    
              sufficient to generate significant waveform anomalies in long-                 
              period surface waves.  In this research the theory will be extended            
              and tests will be done for different types of anisotropy in the                
              upper mantle.
