Abstract    :
              Employing peptide aldehyde inhibitors, model substrates, and the               
              oxidized B chain of insulin the roles of three identified                      
              proteolytic acitve sites in the 20s and 26s proteosomes will be                
              determined.  Heterotropic and homotropic interactions between                  
              various types of catalytic sites will be examined.  The sequence               
              and tertiary structure dependence of the active sites will be                  
              examined.  Isotope labeling studies will be employed to assess the             
              role of processive processing in protein degradation by the                    
              proteasome will be explored.                                                   
              %%%                                                                            
              The controlled degradation of proteins is just as important as                 
              their synthesis in the overall economy of the cell.  Large and                 
              complex structures, the proteasomes, exist to degrade proteins and             
              peptides.  Such degradation plays roles in the immune system as                
              well as in metabolism.  The proposed research is designed to                   
              understand the mechanics of the protein degradation process and how            
              it is controlled.  The shear size of the proteasome and the                    
              complexity of its organization make this a problem of great                    
              difficulty, requiring the use of specific inhibitors to probe the              
              various degradation active sites and the use of carefully designed             
              protein and peptide substrates to examine the catalytic process.//
