Abstract    :
              This project uses an infrared (IR) interferometer to monitor some              
              of the trace constituents of the atmosphere above South Pole and               
              McMurdo, Antarctica.  The measurements will be made in two modes:              
                                                                                             
                   An absorption mode, using the sun as an infrared source of IR             
                   radiation shining through the atmosphere.  This technique will            
                   allow very sensitive measurements of a number of trace                    
                   constituents, especially during the local springtime, when the            
                   antarctic ozone hole is forming.                                          
                                                                                             
                   An emission mode, using radiation emitted by the atmospheric              
                   gases themselves.  This technique is much less sensitive than             
                   the absorption mode, but does allow critical measurements                 
                   during the long, dark polar night, when the chemistry which               
                   sets the stage for the springtime ozone depletion is taking               
                   place.                                                                    
                                                                                             
              The compounds which will be measured include: hydrogen chloride,               
              nitric acid, chlorofluorocarbon 11 and 12, nitrous oxide, methane,             
              ozone and chlorine nitrate.  These gases all play a role in the                
              ozone hole and several of them are also important greenhouse gases.            
                                                                                             
              This project is a precursor to the establishment of an antarctic               
              Network for the Detection of Stratospheric Change (NDSC) station.              
              When the NDSC station is established, presumably at Dome C, then               
              Murcray will begin to make similar measurements there.                         
                                                                                             
              This project is jointly funded by NSF's Office of Polar Programs               
              and Division of Atmospheric Sciences and also by NASA's Office of              
              Earth Sciences and Applications.
