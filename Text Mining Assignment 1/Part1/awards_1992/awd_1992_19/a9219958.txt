Abstract    :
              This renewal proposal will apply the Sr, Nd, Pb, and Os                        
              radiogenic tracer systems to mantle-derived mafic and                          
              ultramafic rocks to further delimit the character of mantle                    
              reservoirs, their location in the mantle and their mode of                     
              origin and evolution.  The P.I.s propose extensive Os                          
              isotope studies of oceanic basalts from localities where the                   
              end-member mantle reservoirs DMM, EMI, EM 2 and HIMU are                       
              most strongly evident.  Ultramafic xenoliths from EM 2 and                     
              HIMU islands will be analyzed to compare with the associated                   
              basalts.  The recognition of a new mantle reservoir,                           
              proposed to be lower mantle, will be explored by Os isotope                    
              tracer studies of basalts from the islands of Ascension and                    
              the Cameroon Line.  The early stages of mantle evolution                       
              (2.5 - 3.7 b.y.)  will be studied by Sr, Nd, Pb and Os                         
              studies of primary magmatic minerals from Archean mafic                        
              rocks.  An to utilize the inherent strengths of the Re/Os                      
              system in studying both early mantle processes (accretion                      
              and core formation)  and present-day processes (derivation                     
              of plumes from ancient oceanic crust stored in the lower                       
              mantle), the P.I.s propose to study the parameters which                       
              control the geochemical behavior of Re and Os.  This will                      
              involve both natural studies of the Re and Os partitioning                     
              between magma and mantle minerals (silicate, sulfide, oxide                    
              and metal), and experimental studies of Re - Os solubility                     
              and partitioning between metal, silicate melt and sulfide                      
              liquid.
