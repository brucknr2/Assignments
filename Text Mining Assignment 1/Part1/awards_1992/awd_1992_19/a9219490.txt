Abstract    :
                   This award provides one-half the funding required for the                 
              purchase of computer equipment to serve the seismology research                
              group in the Department of Earth & Planetary Sciences at Harvard               
              University. Harvard is committed to providing the remaining                    
              necessary funds.                                                               
                   The equipment includes upgrades of two fileservers to                     
              multiprocessor machines, workstation upgrades, acquisition of a                
              color graphics workstation, and the acquisition of a tape archive              
              unit. The seismology research group at Harvard investigates a broad            
              range of problems in seismology including the analysis of very                 
              large data sets for the study of earthquake source parameters and              
              the determination of earth structure.
