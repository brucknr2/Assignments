Abstract    :
              The structural and functional properties of cytochrome P450                    
              proteins and their regulation will be examined for a number of                 
              Antarctic fish species. These proteins are critical in the                     
              metabolism and biological action of many hormones, as well as                  
              pollutants and carcinogens. Some of these proteins are induced by              
              pollutant chemicals and are ideal markers for exposure. The genes              
              for several P450 proteins, and the gene products will be studied.              
              The P450 that is induced by hydrocarbons or polychlorinated                    
              biphenyls and the receptors involved in the regulation of the gene             
              will be characterized. The objectives are to identify structural               
              and functional adaptions of membrane bound enzymes, their gene                 
              regulation and receptor mechanisms in stenothermal cold-adapted                
              animals. Additional objectives are to provide a molecular and                  
              mechanistic basis for evaluating the degree to which foreign                   
              chemicals may be acting in Antarctic fish. These studies should                
              provide a definitive baseline and archival samples of numerous                 
              species, against which results of future samples and analyses can              
              be compared. The results will have implications for detecting and              
              following the present and future effects of chemicals in the                   
              Southern Ocean and may distinguish between chemicals with global               
              and/or local Antarctic sources.
