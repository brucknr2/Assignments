Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The International Union of Physiological Sciences (IUPS) will hold             
              its General Assembly and the XXXII International Congress of                   
              Physiological Sciences in Glasgow, Scotland, August 1-6, 1993.  It             
              is proposed that the American Physiological Society administer a               
              travel grant program offering a limited number of travel awards to             
              qualified scientists who are permanent residents of North America              
              and who may require such assistance.  Special emphasis will be                 
              given to female and underrepresented minority scientists.  The U.S.            
              National Committee for the IUPS will serve as a screening and                  
              selection committee, and the American Physiological Society will               
              act as fiscal agent and award the travel grants.
