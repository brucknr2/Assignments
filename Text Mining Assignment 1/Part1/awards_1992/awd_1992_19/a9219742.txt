Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  To be adaptive, an animal's behavior must change depending                
              on the organism's physiological or developmental state.  Dr.                   
              Truman's research is directed towards understanding both external              
              (e.g. circadian rhythms) factors and internal (e.g. steroid and                
              peptide hormones) factors that influence the central nervous                   
              system to regulate behavior.  Using a relatively simple                        
              invertebrate model system, he is unraveling the mechanisms by                  
              which ecdysteroids, a class of steroid hormones, affect the                    
              release of eclosion hormone, a neuropeptide, to orchestrate                    
              changes in behavior.  Dr. Truman has identified four neurons that              
              are responsible for all of the eclosion hormone found in the                   
              central nervous system.  He will now focus on the cellular                     
              properties of these neurons.  Using state of the art                           
              electrophysiological and anatomical techniques, Dr Truman will                 
              define the mechanisms that control the release of this peptide,                
              and then determine how it acts on the central nervous system to                
              evoke the stereotyped behavior changes.  In addition, he will                  
              employ a different invertebrate model system to examine the                    
              importance of circadian control in controlling behavior.  The                  
              results from this research will provide novel insights into the                
              relationship between the neuroendocrine system and behavior.                   
              These data serve as the foundation for the development and                     
              application of practical procedures in controlling agricultural                
              and medical insect pests.
