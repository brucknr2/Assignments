Abstract    :
                   This project will support the participation of mathematical               
              scientists from the United States at a conference on the                       
              Mathematics of Computation to be held August 9-13, 1993 in                     
              Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada.  Survey and state-of-the-art              
              lectures will be given in plenary sessions, as well as contributed             
              paper sessions on such topics as the numerical solution of partial             
              differential equations, numerical solution of ordinary differential            
              equations, numerical solution of integral equations, numerical                 
              quadrature and cubature, special functions, numerical linear                   
              algebra, numerical solution of nonlinear equations and                         
              optimization, and computational number theory.  This conference is             
              being held in conjunction with the Joint Summer Meetings of the                
              American Mathematical Society, Mathematical Association of America,            
              and Canadian Mathematical Society.
