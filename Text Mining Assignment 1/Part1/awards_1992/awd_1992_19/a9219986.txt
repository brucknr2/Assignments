Abstract    :
                The mechanics of emplacement of huge thrust sheets to                        
              form mountain belts has remained one of the most poorly                        
              understood aspects of tectonics.  It has been long                             
              recognized that fluids have played a critical role in the                      
              emplacement process through the reduction of the tectonic                      
              stress but the exact explanation of how this happens remains                   
              unsolved.   Attempts at physical modeling of this phenomena                    
              have been insightful but have lacked a realistic                               
              consideration of hydrologic and thermal conditions. This                       
              project will construct models that address the above issues                    
              that will predict fluid pressures along fault zones and                        
              within fault bounded blocks.  Results will have important                      
              implications for the development of most mountain belt                         
              systems of the world.
