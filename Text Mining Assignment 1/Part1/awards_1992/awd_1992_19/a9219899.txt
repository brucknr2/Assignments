Abstract    :
              This ongoing project is designed to examine the behavior of                    
              water and carbon dioxide (the most abundant volatile                           
              components in terrestrial igneous rocks) in model and                          
              natural igneous systems.   These components have significant                   
              effects on the behavior of silicate melts, and a knowledge                     
              of these effects is fundamental to understanding magma                         
              origin and evolution.   The proposed work involves                             
              application of experimental petrology and analytical                           
              techniques to measure the bulk concentrations of H2O and CO2                   
              and the concentrations of individual H- and C- bearing                         
              species in synthetic and natural glasses.  The specific                        
              problems to be addressed include: mixed volatiles in                           
              silicate melts and glasses at elevated pressures; 13C/12C                      
              fractionation between vapor and silicate melts; measurement                    
              of the H2O and CO2 concentrations of natural volcanic                          
              glasses; measurement of H2O/CO2 ratios of individual bubbles                   
              in volcanic glasses; and experimental investigation of the                     
              effect of water on the degree of partial melting of mantle                     
              peridotite.
