Abstract    :
                This research is to install and operate for one year a five-                 
              station portable broadband array of REFTEK/STS-2 seismic systems               
              in northeastern Venezuela and Trinidad.  The goal is to image                  
              crustal and upper mantle structures of the eastern Caribbean-South             
              America plate boundary.  The project is a collaborative effort                 
              between the seismology group at INTEVEP, S.A. (Venezuela),                     
              scientists at the Seismic Research Unit, Trinidad, and Carnegie                
              Institution.  The purpose of the seismic experiment is to answer               
              outstanding and controversial questions regarding the nature of                
              the seismogenic plate boundary.  Seismic analysis will focus on two            
              broad areas:  1) the presence or absence of seismic evidence for               
              a relict slab beneath Venezuela and 2) determination of crustal and            
              upper mantle structure by analysis of boundary interaction phases,             
              surface wave inversion, and measurement of delay times and travel-             
              times.  This research is a component of the National Earthquake                
              Hazard Reduction Program.
