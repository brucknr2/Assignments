Abstract    :
              9219589  Wong         Fluid exerts significant mechanical and chemical effects
              on  virtually all crustal processes.  Recent observations suggest that 
              elevated pore pressures may exist in a range of crustal  environments,
              including mature fault zones and accretionary  complexes.  Quantitative
              modeling of the generation and maintenance  of overpressure in most of these
              problems requires a fundamental  understanding of the relation among
              permeability, porosity and  stress.  This is an experimental program to
              determine permeability  and porosity reduction in porous aggregates under
              triaxial  compression conditions.  Microstructural observations, acoustic 
              emission measurements, micromechanical and percolation modeling  will be
              integrated in the study so as to gain a fundamental  physical understanding of
              mechanical compaction, permeability  reduction, cataclastic flow and hydraulic
              transport in the crust.  ***
