Abstract    :
                   PI will perform U-Pb (uranium-lead) dating of single-crystals             
              and small multigrain fractions of phenocrystic zircon from well-               
              characterized K-bentonites (ancient volcanic ash beds) in the                  
              Ordovician and Silurian stratotypes of Sweden, Britain and the                 
              central United States for the purpose of precise time-scale                    
              calibration and biostratigraphic correlation.   The proposed                   
              research will produce an internally consistent and accurate                    
              absolute chronology of the Middle Ordovician through Upper Silurian            
              stratotypes of Britain,and permit direct comparison of coeval but              
              different fauna in North America, Scandinavia and the United                   
              Kingdom.
