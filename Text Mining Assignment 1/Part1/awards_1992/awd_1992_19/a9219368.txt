Abstract    :
                   This award provides funding for the acquisition of instrument             
              components that will serve to upgrade the analytical capabilities              
              (improved sensitivity and decreased mass interferences from oxides)            
              of an inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometer (ICP-MS) system             
              installed in the Department of Geological Sciences at Cornell                  
              University. The PI and research group will also develop the use of             
              a laser ablation source for the ICP-MS. The great promise of laser             
              ablation sampling is its capability for in situ analysis with                  
              spatial resolution, but the application still requires much                    
              development as it applies to complex geological sample targets. The            
              project will develop specific analytical techniques for                        
              microanalysis of trace elements in crustal and mantle minerals.
