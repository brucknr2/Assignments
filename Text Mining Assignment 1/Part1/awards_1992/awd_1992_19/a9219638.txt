Abstract    :
                   A major goal of this project is to develop a better                       
              understanding of the roles macro- and microstress play in affecting            
              domain structures and various remanent magnetizations.  In                     
              addition, the PI will investigate the use of renormalization group             
              theory to explain the large range of local energy minima states                
              that individual grains access.  Particular attention will be placed            
              on  investigating theory that could have important payoffs in                  
              paleomagnetism.  For example, preliminary results of the theory                
              suggest there are important techniques available by which one can              
              distinguish secondary magnetizations rom a primary thermal remanent            
              magnetization.
