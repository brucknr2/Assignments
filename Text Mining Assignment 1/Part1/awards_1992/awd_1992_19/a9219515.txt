Abstract    :
              This grant provides for the continuation of the very productive                
              solar oscillations studies which have been done off and on for many            
              years at South Pole.  The telescope will make high resolution (4               
              arcsecond) images of the full solar disk at two Fraunhofer                     
              wavelengths, Hydrogen-alpha and Calcium II K, which come from                  
              different heights in the solar atmosphere.  The hydrogen line will             
              be analyzed for intensity variations as well as Doppler velocity               
              while the calcium line will be used for intensity variations only.             
              These data will be used to study the interior of the sun by                    
              observing the various modes of the exterior vibrations.  In                    
              particular, studies will focus on the variations of the acoustic               
              oscillations with solar cycle activity, sub-surface structures of              
              magnetic features such as sun spots, the wave properties of the                
              solar atmosphere and the physics of acoustic oscillations with                 
              frequencies above 4 mHz.                                                       
                                                                                             
              The South Pole is a unique observatory for solar astronomy because             
              only there can one observe the sun for extended periods, such as               
              weeks and months, without diurnal interruptions or variations.
