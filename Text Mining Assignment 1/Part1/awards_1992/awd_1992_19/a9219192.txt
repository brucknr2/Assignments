Abstract    :
                   This award will provide partial funding for a systems manager             
              to support the computer system of the geophysics research group in             
              the Department of Geological & Planetary Sciences at Harvard                   
              University. The computer facility presently serves 15-20 faculty,              
              postdoctoral research associates, graduate and undergraduate                   
              students working in computer-intensive areas of research such as               
              seismic tomography, earthquake seismology, geomagnetics, and other             
              studies of the Earth's deep interior.
