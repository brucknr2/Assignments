Abstract    :
                   PIs plus US and Russian collaborators will conduct field and              
              laboratory research on Upper Carboniferous to Lower Permian                    
              paleontology (ammonites, fusulinids, conodonts), stratigraphy and              
              sedimentolgy of strata in the southern Urals, which are among                  
              candidates for stratotypes.  This study will contribute                        
              significantly to global correlation and to understanding events                
              associated with the construction and nature of the supercontinent              
              of Pangaea.
