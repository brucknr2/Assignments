Abstract    :
              9219621  Wannamaker         The PIs will study the magnetic and thermochemical
              properties  of synthetic single crystals of titanomagnetites emphasizing their 
              dependences upon long-range cation ordering.  The effects of high-  temperature
              nonstoichiometry on the magnetic behavior in the  titanomagnetite solid
              solution series are poorly understood.   Although nonstoichiometry and SRO have
               been suggested as possible  explanations for the disparate magnetic results
              obtained in this  mineral system, there has yet to be a definitive experimental
               confirmation of this hypothesis.  Further progress in understanding  the
              crystal chemistry and magnetism of titanomagnetites is now  possible with an
              integrated approach combining thermoelectric  measurements, Mossbauer
              spectroscopy, and magnetic measurements for  a suite of titanomagnetite single
              crystals spanning the range from  magnetite to ulvosponel.  ***
