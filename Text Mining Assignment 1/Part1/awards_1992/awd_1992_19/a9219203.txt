Abstract    :
                   Vicillin (or 7S) seed storage protein genes are expressed                 
              specifically in the apical and central regions (cotyledons, shoot              
              apical meristem and hypocotyl) of dicot plant embryos after the                
              periods of cell division and morphogenesis.  THey are good markers             
              for the late stage of cotyledon maturation.  Necessary and                     
              sufficient information for apical expression in transgenic tobacco             
              embryos is contained within a fragment of DNA (UAS1, -295 to -109)             
              from a bean 7S gene (B-phaseolin).  We have used electrophoretic               
              mobility shift assays and methylation interference to identify UAS1            
              nucleotide motifs which are directly contacted by bean nuclear                 
              protein(s) in vitro.  In order to understand how the UAS2 element              
              regulates gene activation during development we are cloning cDNA               
              sequences that code for UAS1 binding proteins.  We will complete               
              cloning of cDNA sequences coding for bean nuclear protein(s) that              
              bind to the Vb1 and Vb2 segments of the seed-specific enhancer.  We            
              will also study the interactions between individual protein factors            
              and their target sites on the DNA and how they affect spatial                  
              regulation of gene transcription in tobacco plants.                            
              %%%                                                                            
              The rational design of improved agricultural crops regquires                   
              targeting novel gene activities to specific plant tissues and                  
              organs.  In order to accomplish that economically important goal,              
              a thorough understanding of the factors that regulate plant                    
              development must be achieved.  These studies on the interaction                
              between specific DNA sequences and nuclear regulatory proteins                 
              leading to developmentally controlled and tissue specific gene                 
              expression will enhance our understanding of those mechanisms.
