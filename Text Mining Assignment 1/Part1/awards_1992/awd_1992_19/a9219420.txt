Abstract    :
                   The ultimate goal of this research is to understand the                   
              molecular mechanisms that account for the switch from human fetal              
              gamma to adult beta-like globin gene expression, a paradigm for the            
              study of developmental control involving both gene activation and              
              repression.  The specific objectives of this proposal are to                   
              identify regulatory sequences involved in human gamma- to beta-                
              globin gene switching using transgenic mice, and to isolate the                
              transcription factor gammaPE.  The gamma-globin gene promoter plays            
              an important role in down-regulating the beta-globin gene in the               
              embryo.  Using transgenic mice, the element responsible for this               
              silencing mechanism will be identified.  GammaPE is a negative                 
              regulator of gamma-globin gene expression, and may therefore be                
              important in down-regulating the gene in the adult.  The role of               
              gammaPE will be tested in transgenic mice by deleting and inserting            
              gammaPE binding sites near the gamma-globin gene.  A cDNA for                  
              gammaPE will be obtained by screening erythroid and brain                      
              expression libraries using gammaPE binding sites as a probe, or                
              gammaPE will be purified from nuclear extracts and subsequently                
              cloned.  Isolation of a gammaPE clone will allow for more detailed             
              examination of the functional role of gammaPE in future studies.

              Elucidation of this regulated switch in gene expression can act as             
              a paradigm for developmental control of gene expression.
