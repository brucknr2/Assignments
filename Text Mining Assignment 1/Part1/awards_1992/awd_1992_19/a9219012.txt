Abstract    :
              This award supports an isotopic study of the Dufek layered                     
              ultramafic intrusion.  The objectives of the research are a                    
              better understanding of igneous processes in large mafic magma                 
              chambers, an accurate determination of the age of the Dufek                    
              intrusion, and an assessment of the origin of sulfide and                      
              chromite mineralization in the intrusion.  The Dufek intrusion is              
              part of the Karoo-Ferrar tholeiitic province, one of the largest               
              such provinces known on Earth.  This research will involve high                
              precision mass spectrometric analysis of neodymium, strontium,                 
              lead, and osmium isotopes from ultrapure fractions of minerals                 
              separated from rock samples.  These analyses will be used to                   
              trace compositional changes of both the liquid and cumulus                     
              (solid) phases during crystallization and crystal segregation                  
              processes.  Lead and osmium isotopes will be used to tracers to                
              ascertain whether sulfide mineralization resulted from increased               
              silica activity associated with crustal contamination or  whether              
              sulfide mineralization was caused only by changes of temperature               
              and oxygen fugacity.  This research will help to elucidate                     
              processes of magma differentiation and mineralization associated               
              with large ultramafic intrusions in general.  Such intrusions are              
              important sources of platinum group elements.
