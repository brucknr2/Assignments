Abstract    :
              9219541  Meyer       Portable arrays of digital seismometers recording passive 
              sources (earthquakes) or active sources (explosions) are capable  of imaging
              buried structure in the crust and mantle. This award  will support the
              development of a new type of portable digital  seismograph for field deployment
              in seismic array experiments of  long duration in remote areas where
              maintenance is difficult and  expensive. Some of the desired design features to
              be incorporated  include low power consumption, waterproof, temperature 
              insensitivity, improved timing, and capable of burial against the  threat of
              vandalism.   ***
