Abstract    :
                   PIs will examine evolution of co-occurring lineages of benthic            
              marine invertebrates from the well-studied Middle Devonian Hamilton            
              and Tully groups, to determine how ecology influences rate and                 
              style of evolution.  Morphometrics of selected fauna will establish            
              degree of change of lineages within constrained biofacies through              
              several transgressive/regressive cycles.  Community structure will             
              be examined to test the degree of community stability.  The origin,            
              stability and demise of the Hamilton-Tully fauna will be examined              
              as a case study of apparently coordinated or community-level                   
              stasis, leading to a general model for the dynamics of ancient                 
              marine benthic communities.  PIs will also produce a photo atlas.
