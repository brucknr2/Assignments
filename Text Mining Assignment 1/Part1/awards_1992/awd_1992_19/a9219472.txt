Abstract    :
                   Isostatic uplift of denuded footwall rocks beneath a                      
              shallowly-dipping detachment fault is thought to cause upwards                 
              arching of the detachment and may cause the shallow past of the                
              fault to be abandoned.  This theory predicts that as fault slip                
              continues, the hinge zone between steep, active and shallow,                   
              inactive parts of the fault will migrate through the footwall.                 
              Alternative models predict different strain paths will be recorded             
              in the footwall rocks.  This study will test the hypothesis of a               
              migrating hinge zone by examining the strain state in footwall                 
              rocks beneath three detachment faults from different tectonic                  
              settings:  Beaver Dam Mountains, Utah; Whipple Mountains,                      
              California; and Brenner Line, eastern Alps.  The results will allow            
              assessment of the migrating hinge models and will have broad                   
              applicability to extensional zones in a variety of tectonic                    
              environments.
