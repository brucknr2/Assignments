Abstract    :
                   One of the remaining fundamental questions in                             
              extensional tectonics is the role of intrusive rocks which                     
              commonly are emplaced during extension.  The Miocene                           
              intrusive complex of the Eldorado Mountains of southern                        
              Nevada was emplaced broadly synchronously with extreme                         
              crustal extension.   It provides a unique opportunity to                       
              investigate the nature and genesis of granitic and more                        
              mafic magmas in extensional settings and the interplay                         
              between tectonism and igneous processes.  This project will                    
              employ field, geochronologic, petrographic and barometric                      
              data to assess the role of the plutonic rocks in the                           
              tectonic and volcanic history of this region.  Results                         
              should apply to the general questions of the relationship                      
              between pluton emplacement and extensional deformation, the                    
              chemical and mechanical effects of plutonism on the upper                      
              crust and the origin of petrochemical "fingerprints" of                        
              extensional igneous rocks.
