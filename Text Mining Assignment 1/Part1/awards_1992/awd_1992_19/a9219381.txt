Abstract    :
              This award supports a fission-track study of basement rocks                    
              of central and west Spitsbergen.  The study will test ideas                    
              about the uplift history of Spitsbergen with respect to                        
              three tectonic provinces identified in the central and western                 
              part of the island complex.  The goal of this research is to                   
              understand the uplift and exhumation history of Spitsbergen                    
              in terms of regional plate kinematics in the North Atlantic                    
              region.
