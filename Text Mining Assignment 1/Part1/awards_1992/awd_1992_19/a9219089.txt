Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This research combines experimental and theoretical approaches to              
              investigate mechanisms of slip transmission across coherent                    
              interphase boundaries in intermetallic compounds.  Single crystal              
              titanium aluminides, TiAl and Ti3Al, are grown, mechanically                   
              tested, and the results compared to theoretical predictions of                 
              dislocation core structures and the interaction of dislocations                
              with interphase boundaries.  Computer modeling of the interface                
              between the aluminide phases is carried out in parallel with the               
              dislocation calculations.  The microstructures of the alloys are               
              varied by combinations of diffusion bonding and/or diffusive                   
              infiltration. The fracture mechanisms in these intermetallic                   
              materials are assessed.  Compression testing, transmission electron            
              microscopy, and atomic force microscopy are employed.

              This research advances the frontiers of atomistic modeling for                 
              simulating interfaces and understanding of mechanical behavior in              
              high temperature intermetallic alloys of technological importance.
