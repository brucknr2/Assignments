Abstract    :
                This research will investigate upper mantle stratification in the            
              vicinity of subducting slabs by means of stacked seismograms that              
              reveal underside reflections from discontinuities.  A systematic               
              analysis will be made of earthquake records for deep and                       
              intermediate depth events in the circum-Pacific subduction zones               
              using broadband digital data as well as WWSSN and LRSM analog data.            
              This will provide constraints on the character of mantle                       
              discontinuities in the thermally perturbed mantle near subducting              
              slabs and back-arc basins.  Variations in depth and impedance                  
              contrasts for P and S wave reflectors will then be interpreted in              
              terms of thermal and petrological models for upper mantle layering             
              near subduction zones.
