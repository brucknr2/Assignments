Abstract    :
                   Vertical axis rotations (with respect to original or                      
              regional orientations) of blocks of rock have been defined                     
              adjacent to major strike-slip faults.  Kinematic models for                    
              these rotations have been proposed, and they require                           
              knowledge of the size of the blocks that behave rigidly and                    
              the spatial and temporal distributions of rotations.                           
              However available data do not allow testing between the                        
              various models.  This project will examine paleomagnetically                   
              determined rotations adjacent to the Las Vegas Valley Shear                    
              Zone and the Lake Mead Fault System.  The rocks yield stable                   
              primary directions and show large rotations.  Dense sampling                   
              will constrain the size of blocks and their distribution                       
              with respect to the faults.  Results should help resolve                       
              competing kinematic models for vertical axis rotations and                     
              permit the development of physical models describing                           
              fundamental processes during crustal deformation.
