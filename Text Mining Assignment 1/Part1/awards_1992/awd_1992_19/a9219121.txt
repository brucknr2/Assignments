Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Geochemical evidence from high-sulfur impact glass spherules at the            
              Cretaceous/Tertiary (K/T) boundary indicates that a bolide impact              
              occurred on evaporite sediment terrane, resulting in major emission            
              to the atmosphere.  PIs will study the consequences of bolide                  
              impact on such terrane, the resulting degassing of sulfurous gases             
              to the atmosphere, formation of sulfuric acid aerosol, and effects             
              on the atmosphere and land.  Sulfuric acid aerosol and possibly                
              acid rain may have been key factors in the global extinction at the            
              K/T boundary.  The severity of the extinctions may thus be largely             
              a function of the unusual geology of the target terrane.  During               
              the first year PIs will determine experimentally the processes of              
              degassing of anhydrite and gypsum sediments and the speciation of              
              sulfur gases emitted.  In the second year PIs will model the                   
              environmental effects of an impact-induced sulfuric acid aerosol.              
              These effects may include:  (a) alkalinity crisis due to the                   
              fallout of CaO derived from dissociation of anhydrite, (b) global              
              cooling due to stratospheric sulfate aerosol, and (c) acid rain                
              from fallout of sulfate aerosol.
