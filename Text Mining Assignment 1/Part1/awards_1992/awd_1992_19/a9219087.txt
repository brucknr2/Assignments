Abstract    :
              9219087  Malin  This award supports a project to quantify physical and chemical 
              weathering rates in the Dry Valleys region of the Transantarctic  Mountains. 
              The ultimate goal of this long term project is to use  information about
              weathering rates to help elucidate past  environmental conditions in this area.
               The specific work  proposed here is to collect abrasion targets, which have
              been  exposed for 10 years at 10 sites in the Dry Valleys and one site  at the
              Allen Hills, and collect other information about site  conditions.  This will
              result in 10 year average weathering rates  for several different  standard 
              materials as a function of  environmental conditions at each site.  Weathering
              rates  determined from this study will be an important parameter to  consider
              in interpretation of exposure age dates that are used to  estimate the history
              of ice and snow cover.  ***
