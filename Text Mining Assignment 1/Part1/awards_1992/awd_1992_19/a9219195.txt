Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The Department of Botany and Plant Sciences, University of                     
              California, Riverside (UCR) has held a symposium each of the past              
              15 years on timely topics in plant physiology.  The 16th Annual                
              Symposium, entitled "Plant Response to Cellular Dehydration During             
              Environmental Stress," will be held January 28-30, 1993, and will              
              be organized by Professors Timothy J. Close and Elizabeth A. Bray.             
                                                                                             
              The objective of the 1993 Symposium is to bring together scientists            
              working in the area of environmental stress, with the intention                
              that discussion and presentations will lead to a greater                       
              understanding of cellular, physiological, and genetic aspects of               
              stress adaptation.  Speakers, especially young investigators, from             
              abroad and other institutions in the U.S. will be invited.  Time               
              for discussion and poster presentation is allotted.  Presented                 
              papers, as well as poster abstracts, will be published rapidly and             
              inexpensively.                                                                 
                                                                                             
              Riverside is an ideal location for this symposium because:  (1)                
              there are a substantial number of faculty here and in Southern                 
              California with research interests in environmental stress; (2)                
              Riverside is easily accessible; (3) UCR has built a reputation for             
              successful symposia; (4) the close proximity to the 1993 Gordon                
              Research Conference on Temperature Stress in Plants which will                 
              follow this conference.
