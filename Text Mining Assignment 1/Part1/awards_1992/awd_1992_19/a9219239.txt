Abstract    :
                This research deals with increasing the resolution of global                 
              earth models by extending the inversion theory to account for non-             
              great circle paths taken by surface waves as a result of the                   
              earth's lateral inhomogeneity.  The basic theory has been developed            
              by the Principal Investigator and the current work will begin its              
              application and investigate the theory's assumption of non-                    
              coupling between modes with models of anisotropy, earth rotation,              
              and lateral heterogeneity.  Improved velocity models of the upper              
              mantle are expected to result.
