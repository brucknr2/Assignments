Abstract    :
                   Eggs, embryos, and ontogenetic stages of particular                       
              dinosaur species allow for the determination of life history                   
              strategies.  Characteristics such as egg size, egg clutch                      
              size, hatchling size, maximum size of nestling, growth rates                   
              during life, and size of individuals at sexual maturity can                    
              presently be determined for at least four dinosaur species                     
              from Montana and Alberta.  PI will exploration and                             
              collection of eggs and young of additional taxa from the                       
              Lower Cretaceous Cloverly Formation and Upper Cretaceous                       
              Judith River Foundation, well as other Cretaceous                              
              formations.  Compilation and comparison of these data will                     
              allow hypotheses to be made concerning the evolutionary                        
              dynamics of dinosaurs.  More life history information will                     
              be known for these dinosaurs than for any other extinct                        
              vertebrate.
