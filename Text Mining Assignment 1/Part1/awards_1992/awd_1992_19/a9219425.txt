Abstract    :
                   PI and collaborators will conduct a paleontological study of              
              the mayaroensis/eugubina Interval-Zone of Mexico.  Contrary to                 
              general belief, knowledge of the planktic fauna of this zone is in             
              its infancy.  The sections to be studied contain abundant and well-            
              preserved planktic and benthic foraminifera, as well as calcareous             
              nannoplankton, which will allow an intergration of both fossil                 
              groups into a common biostratigraphic framework.  The Mexican                  
              sections are among the most complete in the Gulf Coastal Plain of              
              North America, and this study will help address the controversy on             
              the nature of faunal change at the terminal Cretaceous.  It will               
              also provide the basis for further chronostratigraphic correlations            
              within the region and globally.  Furthermore, quantitative                     
              morphometrics of foraminiferal taxa will be performed in order to              
              circumscribe the ambiguous definition of the taxa included in the              
              "small globigerinas" group, resulting in a better understanding of             
              their phylogenetic relationships.
