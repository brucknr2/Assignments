Abstract    :
                   We will continue studies of the experimental                              
              determination of the dissolution and precipitation kinetics                    
              of silicates and aluminosilicates as functions of pH,                          
              temperature, ionic strength, and the Gibbs Free energy of                      
              reaction (delta G); to examine the surfaces of the reacted                     
              minerals using surface analytical techniques (XPS, AES, SEM,                   
              AFM in particular), which when combined with rates                             
              determined from solution chemistry using flow-through                          
              reactors will provide information on surface reaction                          
              mechanisms; and to apply the rate data obtained to model low                   
              temperature field cases in particular the Pijiguaos, bauxite                   
              deposit Venezuela Our experimental work continues to lead                      
              the way in describing both dissolution and precipitation                       
              rates of major rock-forming silicates and aluminosilicates                     
              as a function delta G, as well as being the first to measure                   
              precipitation rates in phases more complex than quartz.  The                   
              non-trivial full rate laws that have been developed in our                     
              prior work can now be incorporated into an accurate two-                       
              dimensional hydrodynamic model of fluid flow in porous                         
              media.  With the continuing work proposed here, the coupling                   
              of experiment, theory and models should result in the first                    
              completely quantitative physical and chemical model of                         
              diagenesis in a dynamic sedimentary basin and to chemical                      
              evolution in a major bauxite deposit.
