Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Glucocorticoid hormones produce cell death in specific cell types              
              of the immune system (T-cells) by inducing changes in gene                     
              expression. The phenomenon provides a basis for using                          
              glucocorticoids to treat patients with lymphomas and lukemias. This            
              project will study how the proteins that bind glucocorticoid                   
              hormones (receptors) cooperate with other regulatory proteins to               
              alter gene expression in a murine T-lymphoma cell line. The effect             
              of mutations in the receptor gene and in genes encoding other                  
              participating proteins will be studied. The goals  are to                      
              understand the basic mechanisms involved in regulation of gene                 
              expression by glucocorticoid receptors and to identify more                    
              effective methods for treating T-lymphomas.
