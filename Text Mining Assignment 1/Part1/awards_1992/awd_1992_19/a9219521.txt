Abstract    :
              The goal of this research project is to investigate the                        
              geochemistry, isotope geology, age, and tectonic                               
              significance of mafic intrusive rocks in the Sierra Nevada,                    
              White Mountains, Inyo Mountains, and Mojave Desert.   The                      
              proposed research will include a study of the widespread                       
              Independence dike swarm as a coeval intrusive suite which                      
              crosses several tectonic boundaries.  Field mapping, major-,                   
              trace-element and isotopic analyses,  Sr, Nd, and Pb                           
              isotopic analyses, and U-Pb age determinations of rock                         
              suites should provide constraints on the nature of the                         
              mantle that generated the batholithic magmas in California                     
              and data to test various models for the tectonic evolution                     
              of the southwestern United States.
