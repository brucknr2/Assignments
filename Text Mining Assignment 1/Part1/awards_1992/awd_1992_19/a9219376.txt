Abstract    :
                   This project is dedicated to the study, at the finest                     
              microscope scale attainable, of minerals and their deviations from             
              structural and chemical ideality. Electron-beam techniques will be             
              applied, including high-resolution transmission and analytical                 
              electron microscopy as well as scanning probe microscopy (scanning             
              tunneling and atomic force) to study localized regions of                      
              structural and chemical disorder in minerals. Such regions are                 
              common and provide insights into (a) the origin and geologic                   
              history of the host minerals, which act as recorders of uncompleted            
              reactions; and (b) reaction mechanisms such as occur during                    
              metamorphism, diagenesis, and weathering.                                      
                   The PI and team plan specifically to study layer silicate                 
              minerals (including mixed-layer chlorite/smectite and corrensite;              
              berthierine, Fe-rich chlorite, and mixed layer intermediates; and              
              a unique fibrous mica), and C-60 and other fullerenes found in                 
              nature. They also will explore the use of advanced techniques such             
              as TEM cathodoluminescence, high-angle annular dark-field                      
              compositional mapping, scanning probe microscopy, and ultra-high               
              resolution electron microscopes as applicable to the study of                  
              minerals
