Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This award supports a project designed to establish the                        
              relationship between environmental temperature and the                         
              Deuterium/Hydrogen (D/H) ratio in unexchangeable hydrogen in                   
              cellulose extracted from trees from locations covering a wide range            
              of climatic conditions.  The project will ascertain to what degree             
              factors other than temperature affect the Deuterium/Hydrogen (D/H)             
              ratio.  Among these might be humidity, growth history, the nature              
              of the root system and its relationship to the source water used by            
              the trees, and generally the relationship between the D/H ratio in             
              cellulose and the hydrology of the area.   The collecting sites are            
              located in Oregon, California, and Manitoba, Canada.  The                      
              resolution of these factors will allow the retrieval of climatic               
              information from many trees from different locations.  The                     
              Deuterium/Hydrogen records currently indicate unexpectedly that the            
              rate of global warming is greater in the 19th century than in the              
              20th century.  This is contrary to what is expected if global                  
              warming were directly related to the increase in atmospheric C02.              
              The confirmation of this result is critical to our understanding of            
              the role that C02 plays in affecting the earth's climate.
