Abstract    :
              The principal objective of the proposed research is to                         
              clarify the thermochemistry of Ti-, Al-, and Fe3+ -                            
              substituted clinopyroxenes and Ag2S-Cu2S-FeS-ZnS-As2S3-Sb2S3-                  
              S sulfosalts/sulfides by experimental, theoretical,                            
              spectroscopic, and petrologic studies.  Studies of the                         
              sulfosalt/sulfide systems will involve evacuated silica tube                   
              experiments to elucidate net transport and As-Sb and Ag-Cu                     
              exchange reactions.   Studies of the pyroxene system will                      
              utilize available pyroxene-liquid compositional data from                      
              melting and crystallization experiments.  The pyroxene study                   
              should have significant impact on mainstream petrology as                      
              the development of a reliable model for pyroxene                               
              thermochemistry is a prerequisite to quantitative modelling                    
              of igneous processes such as crystallization and crystal                       
              fractionation.  The sulfosalt/sulfide thermochemical study                     
              is a longer-term effort that will find application in                          
              understanding solid (sulfide) - liquid (groundwater, brine,                    
              ore-forming fluid) interactions.
