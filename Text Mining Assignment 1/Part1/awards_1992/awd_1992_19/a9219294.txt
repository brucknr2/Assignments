Abstract    :
              9219294  Hollister         This project involves a pilot seismic profile
              designed to  improve understanding of processes of continental growth
              associated  with terrane accretion in the Coast orogen of southeast Alaska and 
              British Columbia.  The seismic data will provide constraints  pertaining to
              models for the role of thick-skinned thrusting,  metamorphism and magmatism in
              the formation of continental  lithosphere.  They will also constrain models on
              how subduction and  translation were accommodated during a major shift in
              relative  plate motions from head-on (mid Cretaceous) to transcurrent 
              (Eocene), and how this rearrangement affected crustal development.   The
              seismic results will guide design of subsequent research  proposals on these
              problems.         The seismic profiling will use an acoustic source array 
              deployed from a marine research ship that crosses the Coast orogen  along a 130
              km long fjord, and densely spaced (3-5 km) 3-component  seismic recorders
              placed along the shore to record offsets from 0  to 200 km.  The ship will also
              deploy a 4 km long hydrophone  streamer for simultaneous MCS (multi-channel
              seismic) profiling.   This unique experiment combines proven marine seismic
              techniques  with the new capability of the seismic recorders to determine mid 
              to lower crustal structure and physical properties of an area of  known
              continental accretion.  ***
