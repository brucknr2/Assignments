Abstract    :
              9219595  Zeitler         The 40Ar/39Ar dating of feldspar has enormous potential
              for  helping geologists determine quantitative temperature-time paths  over the
              range of 150oC to 350oC.  Such  time-temperature  information over such a range
              of low temperatures is of great  importance to scientists evaluating such
              issues as the architecture  and evolution of the crust or the origin and
              evolution of  sedimentary basins and their attendant water and hydrocarbon 
              resources.  However, to this point the technique has only been  tested in
              short-term laboratory heating experiments and in  presumably well-characterized
              geological contexts.  Now that  sophisticated interpretative models have been
              developed for use in  quantitative thermochronometry, it is important that the
              40Ar/39Ar  dating of feldspar be evaluated in a slow-cooling geological 
              environment.  The KTB deep drill hole in Germany offers an ideal  natural
              laboratory with which to examine the closure of feldspar  to diffusive Ar loss
              during slow cooling, as this hole already has  reached temperatures which
              overlap the closure interval for  feldspars and is projected to reach ~300oC. 
              In this project, a  suite of samples from deep in the KTB hole will be examined
              which  will permit the principal investigator to view the process of Ar 
              closure as it is happening, and would be an invaluable benchmark  for virtually
              all applied studies which use feldspar  thermochronometry.         At the same
              time, the understanding of 40Ar/39Ar systematics  in feldspar is sufficiently
              good that study of shallow samples from  the KTB hole will permit the principal
              investigator to monitor in  detail the post-orogenic cooling of the local
              crust; he will assess  the relative roles that thermal relaxation and
              denudation have  played, and will look for evidence of even a very mild
              Tertiary  thermal event that might be responsible for the high gradients seen 
              in the KTB hole.  Such information will be highly useful for models  of thermal
              evolution of the lithosphere du ring and after mountain  building.   ***
