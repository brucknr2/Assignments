Abstract    :
                   Magnetic techniques such as magnetic anisotropy offer                     
              the promise of providing an efficient means of measuring                       
              finite strain in deformed rocks.  However due to several                       
              factors the methods are not presently robust.  This project                    
              will investigate the mineralogical control of magnetic                         
              anisotropy by use of the Thompson formation of northern                        
              Minnesota.  Results are expected to demonstrate the                            
              compositional effects of deformed sedimentary rocks on                         
              various magnetic properties, with the goal of developing a                     
              reliable tool for measuring strain.
