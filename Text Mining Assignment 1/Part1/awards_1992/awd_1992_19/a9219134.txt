Abstract    :
              This project is designed to investigate the petrogenesis of                    
              anorthosite-jotunite-mangerite rocks from the Grenville                        
              Province of Canada.  Suites of rocks from the St. Urbain,                      
              Labrieville, and Morin regions will be investigated through                    
              integrated field, petrological, and geochemical studies.                       
              The results should elucidate the nature of parental magmas                     
              and differentiation  mechanisms of massif anorthosites and                     
              associated mangerites and the significance and origin of                       
              associated mafic, oxide-rich lithologies (jotunites) and  Fe-                  
              Ti oxide ore deposits.
