Abstract    :
              9219002  Diebold         This project involves a pilot seismic profile designed
              to  improve understanding of processes of continental growth associated  with
              terrane accretion in the Coast orogen of southeast Alaska and  British
              Columbia.  The seismic data will provide constraints  pertaining to models for
              the role of thick-skinned thrusting,  metamorphism and magmatism in the
              formation of continental  lithosphere.  They will also constrain models on how
              subduction and  translation were accommodated during a major shift in relative 
              plate motions from head-on (mid Cretaceous) to transcurrent  (Eocene), and how
              this rearrangement affected crustal development.   The seismic results will
              guide design of subsequent research  proposals on these problems.         The
              seismic profiling will use an acoustic source array  deployed from a marine
              research ship that crosses the Coast orogen  along a 130 km long fjord, and
              densely spaced (3-5 km) 3-component  seismic recorders placed along the shore
              to record offsets from 0  to 200 km.  The ship will also deploy a 4 km long
              hydrophone  streamer for simultaneous MCS (multi-channel seismic) profiling.  
              This unique experiment combines proven marine seismic techniques  with the new
              capability of the seismic recorders to determine mid  to lower crustal
              structure and physical properties of an area of  known continental accretion.
