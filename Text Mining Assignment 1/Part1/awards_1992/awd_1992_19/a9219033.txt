Abstract    :
              This US-Brazil Cooperative Science award will                                  
              support collaboration of Manfred Morari,

              Grande do Sul, Brazil.  The project aims to                                    
              make a comparative analysis of alternatives for                                
              dynamic simulation of chemical processes on                                    
              computers with parallel architectures and                                      
              supercomputers.                                                                
                                                                                             
              Chemical process simulation is responsible for                                 
              many CPU cycles used on mini and mainframe                                     
              computers.  Simulation models describing                                       
              industrial processes of realistic complexity                                   
              translate into problems of very large                                          
              dimension, and high-speed simulators are                                       
              required to make these simulations feasible.                                   
              Thus, high-speed computers must be used, and                                   
              simulators suitable for these computers must be                                
              developed.  In this project, the researchers                                   
              will consider a range of industrial problems in                                
              order to improve the performance of the                                        
              developed algorithms and provide more reliable                                 
              comparisons with commercial dynamic simulators.                                
              The mutual benefits of this project will accrue                                
              from the Brazilian side's expertise in dynamic                                 
              simulation, and the US side's computing                                        
              facilities at Caltech.
