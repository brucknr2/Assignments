Abstract    :
              Protein G is a multi-domain component of the cell wall of some                 
              Streptococcal species and binds to all subclasses of human                     
              immunoglobulin G (IgG) by the constant Fc region.  The IgG                     
              binding function of Streptococcal Protein G is contained in a                  
              globular domain  of 56 amino acids designated GB.  The objectives              
              of this proposal are 1) to determine the tertiary structure of GB              
              and relevant mutants using NMR spectroscopy; 2) to use this                    
              domain as a model to study protein folding and stability using                 
              NMR, microcalorimetry, CD, fluorescence spectroscopy and site-                 
              directed mutagenesis; and 3) to study the basic mechanisms of                  
              molecular recognition involved in the high affinity interaction                
              of GB with the heavy-chain, constant region (Fc) of IgG using the              
              above methods.  The long term objective is to better understand                
              the function of this class of Fc receptor proteins and engineer                
              new classes of Fc receptor proteins.                                           
              %%%                                                                            
              GB is an ideal protein to probe the relationship of amino acid                 
              sequence to structure and stability.  It is on the lower limit in              
              size for a stable unique protein structure.  Furthermore it                    
              achieves its stability without disulfide bonds or tight ligand                 
              binding.  Its small size permits the application of numerous                   
              biophysical techniques to study the folding and stability, in                  
              particular NMR methods.  Little information is yet available                   
              concerning the specific nature of the binding interaction of GB                
              with Fc or the mechanism of its class selectivity.  Because                    
              Protein G is class specific in its binding to IgG and binds to                 
              the portion of the immunoglobulin that defines its class, we                   
              believe that our proposed studies will not only help elucidate                 
              the mechanism of recognition but also permit the engineering of                
              Fc receptors with new class selectivities.  Fc receptors with new              
              properties will have numerous medical and biotechnological                     
              applications.
