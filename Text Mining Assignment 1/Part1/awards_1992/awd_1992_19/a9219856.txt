Abstract    :
                This research is to continue the recording and analysis of a                 
              triaxial set of 10 Hz geophones placed at a depth of 2.5 km in the             
              Cajon Pass deep drill hole near the San Andreas fault in southern              
              California.  To date, the instrumentation has recorded several                 
              hundred earthquakes at frequencies up to 400 Hz.  Most larger                  
              events were recorded simultaneously by a 2 Hz triaxial surface                 
              seismometer.  Results suggest that surface seismograms are severely            
              depleted in high frequency wave amplitudes and downhole seismograms            
              have high corner frequencies and high frequency power law amplitude            
              decays.  Additional wide-band seismic sensors will be installed at             
              2.0 and 3.5 km depths in order to give an improved measure of                  
              natural seismicity and record microearthquake scaling in a volume              
              of seismically active crust.  This research is a component of the              
              National Earthquake Hazard Reduction Program.
