Abstract    :
              This research project is a description and analysis of two                     
              experimental studies in visual ethnography: a portrayal of Koyukon             
              Indians (Alaskan Athabascans), and a comparative study of the                  
              reindeer-herding Khanty (Ostyaks) of Western Siberia. The project              
              addresses issues of cultural representation and the incorporation              
              of Native perspectives in ethnography, two major themes in                     
              anthropology today, and of great interest to Native Americans. This            
              project also contributes to the development of Native American                 
              education, a national concern and priority.
