Abstract    :
                   This award provides 57% of the funds required to purchase an              
              infrared microscope system to be installed and operated in the                 
              Department of Geosciences at the New Mexico Institute of Mining and            
              Technology. New Mexico Tech is committed to providing the remaining            
              funds needed for the acquisition.                                              
                   The equipment will be used primarily in research conducted by             
              the Principal Investigator, students, and colleagues to further                
              understanding of the conditions and processes of formation of ore              
              deposits.
