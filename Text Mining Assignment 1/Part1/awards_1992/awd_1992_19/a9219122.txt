Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              An emerging literature suggests that natriuretic peptides (NPs)                
              from the heart and brain may play a role in osmoregulation and                 
              cardiovascular physiology in fishes, as they do in mammals.                    
              However, current data are somewhat conflicting and are largely                 
              based on use of heterologous peptides and antibodies.  We propose              
              to undertake a series of protocols to clone and sequence the                   
              gene(s) for NPs in two species of fishes with quite dissimilar                 
              osmoregulatory problems and abilities (the toadfish and hagfish).              
              Such studies will form the prelude for studies of the physiology of            
              these peptides in fish physiology, and will enable a critical                  
              analysis of the evolution of the form and function of this                     
              important family of hormones.
