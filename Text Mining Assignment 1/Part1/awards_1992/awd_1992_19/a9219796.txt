Abstract    :
              9219796  Kincaid         The role of subduction and magmatism in the growth of
              the  continental crust and the evolution of the crust/mantle system has  long
              been recognized, but a detailed, process-oriented under-  standing of the
              subduction cycle has been elusive.  In this project  the principal
              investigators will combine experimental petrology and  geochemistry,
              observational seismology, isotope and trace element  geochemistry and
              laboratory convection experiments with numerical  approaches to the thermal
              structure and large-scale convection of  the slab and mantle wedge, and porous
              flow models for melt and  fluid migration in the arc environment.  Heat flow
              and various  analyses of seismic data, from primarily the Japan arc, will 
              constrain the thermal structure and rheological properties used in  the initial
              calculations (2-D and some 3-D) of flow in the slab and  mantle, using a
              temperature-dependent viscosity.  Models developed  for Japan, where seismic
              constraints are strongest, will be used  as a base for Central America and for
              the Cascades, where a young  hot plate is subducting and conditions are far
              from steady state.   Models for transport of hydrous fluids in the vicinity of
              the slab,  and of melts through the mantle will be calculated using the stress 
              and flow fields from the thermal and convection modeling.         Plate scale
              mass transport delivers chemical elements derived  from the continental crust,
              hydrosphere and lithosphere to the deep  source of arc magmas; fluid and melt
              transport processes translate  some fraction of these elements back to the
              surface in crust  building magmas.  Documentably slab-derived elements such as
              10Be  (1.5 Ma half-life), B and U (75 ka half-life in disequilibria  series)
              will be incorporated as chemical tracers in fluid/melt  migration models, with
              fluxes, transport paths and characteristic   transport times constrained from
              chemistry of subconducting  sediments and erupting lavas.  Fluid partitioning
              studies on key  elements will further con strain input to migration models.  
              Predictions from coupled thermal, convection and transport models  regarding
              spatial distribution, character and chemistry of lavas  along the length and
              across the width of arcs will be compared with  observed values, and evaluated
              against observed variations in  subduction parameters from arc to arc to arrive
              at an integrated  model of the subduction cycle and its role in crustal growth
              and  evolution of the mantle.  ***
