Abstract    :
              The Gordon Research Conference on Mammalian DNA repair will be held            
              February 1-5, 1993 in Ventura, California. There will be a general             
              focus on molecular biological approaches to the field with emphasis            
              on understanding of basic mechanisms. The program is broad enough              
              that scientists who do not normally interact will have the                     
              opportunity to do so, especially younger investigators who have                
              been especially encouraged to attend.
