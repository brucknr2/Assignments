Abstract    :
                   This award will provide partial support for an equipment                  
              upgrade to the University of Kentucky electron microprobe                      
              laboratory. The electron microprobe's capabilities for rapid                   
              quantitative chemical analysis of solids with micron-scale spatial             
              resolution will be made available on a campus-wide and regional                
              basis in support of research projects and graduate instruction. The            
              instrument is housed in the Department of Geological Sciences and              
              will also be used by faculty and graduate students in Materials                
              Science and in Physics as well as the research staff of the                    
              Kentucky Geological Survey. Research topics will include the study             
              of metamorphic terranes, lower crust xenoliths, coal studies, thin-            
              film analysis, and characterization of high-temperature                        
              superconducting compounds.
