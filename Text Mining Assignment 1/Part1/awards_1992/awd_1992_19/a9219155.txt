Abstract    :
              The long term objective of this project is the furtherance of our              
              knowledge of the dsDNA virus life cycle by gaining an understanding            
              of the molecular mechanisms by which these viruses packaging DNA               
              and assembly progeny virions within infected cells.  The particular            
              virus chosen for this study, bacteriophage P22, serves as a model              
              for similar processes in less experimentally accessible, human                 
              pathogenic virus such as the Herpesviruses and Adenoviruses.  This             
              type of virus assembles protein shells first and then inserts the              
              dsDNA chromosomes into those shells.                                           
              Two bacteriophage P22 proteins appear to be critical in the DNA                
              recognition process, but do not become part of the completed virus             
              particle.  The process of DNA entry into the preformed capsid is               
              thought to involve a special "portal" structure, built at a unique             
              vertex of the icosahedral capsid.  The function of the proteins                
              involved in DNA recognition and DNA entry will be examined                     
              genetically and biochemically.  The findings will contribute to our            
              understanding of the molecular machine that causes packaging of                
              dsDNA chromosomes by the dsDNA viruses.

              Understanding the process of DNA packaging by these bacteriophage              
              will help  in understanding similar processes in less                          
              experimentally accessibly but medically important animal virus                 
              systems and in developing models for related transport processes               
              such as nuclear RNA transport and bacterial transformation and                 
              conjugation.
