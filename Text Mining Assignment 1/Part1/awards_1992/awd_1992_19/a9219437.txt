Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This award supports the establishment of a two-year cooperative                
              research project between two groups of theoretical physicists led              
              by Benjamin Grinstein, Superconducting Super Collider Laboratory,              
              Dallas, and Anthony Sanda, Nagoya University.  In addition to Dr.              
              Grinstein, six other U.S. scientists will participate in the                   
              project by visiting Japanese research facilities in Nagoya,                    
              Osaka, Hiroshima, and Tsukuba.                                                 
                                                                                             
              The need for this project is underscored by worldwide interest in              
              building e+e- B-factories, and the recognition that B-physics may              
              also be competitively studied in hadron colliders.  In particular              
              there is need to determine which aspects of B-physics are best                 
              studied in electron-positron B-factories, and which in hadronic                
              colliders.  Central to this collaborative effrot are studies of                
              CP-violation (both in B-meson and b-flavored baryons decays),                  
              extraction of elements of the Kobayashi-Maskawa mixing matrix,                 
              and the methods for computing the rates of rare decays of B-                   
              mesons.  In addition, the recently developed techniques of the                 
              heavy quark Effective Theory must be incorporated into these                   
              studies.  These difficult problems will be attacked by combining               
              the varied approaches and expertise that this collaboration                    
              brings together.
