Abstract    :
                   This award will provide one-half the funds required for the               
              acquisition of a thermal ionization, solid-source mass spectrometer            
              to be installed and operated in the Department of Earth and                    
              Planetary Sciences at Washington University, St. Louis. The                    
              University is committed to providing the remaining funds that will             
              be needed for the acquisition.                                                 
                   The instrument will be used primarily in a research program               
              utilizing state-of-the-art techniques in isotope dilution, uranium-            
              lead geochronology and hafnium isotope measurements in zircons. The            
              scientific purpose of the measurements is to understand the                    
              formation of the continents during the evolution of Earth's crust              
              through geologic time.
