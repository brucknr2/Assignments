Abstract    :
                   Ophiolite sequences are of considerable interest as                       
              exposed examples of ancient seafloor or oceanic rocks.  The                    
              Jurassic Apennine-Alpine ophiolites are unusual in that they                   
              have no sheeted dike component with mafic lavas and chert                      
              directly overlying serpentinite and gabbro.  This project                      
              will examine the possibility that the top of the                               
              serpentinite/gabbro basement may be the footwall of a large                    
              low-angle detachment fault exposed on the seafloor prior to                    
              eruption of the  mafic lavas.  Results should help develop                     
              models for ophiolite generation and the role of extensional                    
              faulting in the subsequent evolution of  the system.
