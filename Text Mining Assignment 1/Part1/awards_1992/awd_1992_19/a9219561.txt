Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The overall objective of the proposed research is to identify genes            
              that regulate the development of highly specialized structures                 
              (appressoria) that are essential for rice plant infection by                   
              Magnaporthe grisea. M. grisea is ideal for these studies since                 
              infection structure formation can be induced in vitro, the fungus              
              is highly amenable to both Mendelian and molecular genetic                     
              manipulation and as a plant pathogen it is of major importance.                
              Infection structure formation is initiated following conidia                   
              germination on certain hydrophobic substrata. After limited                    
              extension, the germ tube tip swells to form a dome shaped                      
              attachment structure, the appressorium. An infection hyphae emerges            
              from the appressorium at the contact interface and penetrates                  
              directly. Dr. Dean has previously identified two genes, mif23 and              
              mif29, that are specifically expressed during infection structure              
              formation. Since these genes respond to environmental signals, he              
              proposes to fuse promoters to selectable markers in order to obtain            
              mutations in regulatory pathway genes. He has also identified                  
              mutants blocked at various stages of development and propose to                
              search for more. The affected genes will be genetically mapped and             
              functionally complemented by DNA transformation. Complementing DNA             
              will be recovered and the genes cloned and characterized. The                  
              identification of these genes is paramount to understanding and                
              controlling the mechanism(s) regulating cell surface interactions              
              and fungal infection of plants.
