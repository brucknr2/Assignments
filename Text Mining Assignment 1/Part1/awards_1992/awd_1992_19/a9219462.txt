Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Uncertainty in modeling the response of Earth environments to                  
              changing conditions such as global warming arises from a poor                  
              understanding of the dynamics of these environments.  It is                    
              established that over the past 20,000 years the Sahara has                     
              undergone dramatic swings from more extensive and sand-sea                     
              development than today to being vegetated with common lakes and                
              rivers.  While   these swings correspond to Milankovitch cycles,               
              our basis for understanding these in a process-response model has              
              only recently begun to emerge.  The area of the Sahara extending               
              from the Atlas Mountains onto the Sahara Platform in Tunisia offers            
              a microcosm of diverse environments, where deposits are housed in              
              a subsiding trough.  Remote sensing is first used to map present               
              environments, recognize relict features, and locate specific                   
              depocenters for detailed field work.  Field work involves the                  
              establishment of an unconformity-bounded stratigraphic framework               
              for eolian, fluvial and lacustrine deposits in the area through                
              field mapping of soil-geomorphic and stratigraphic relationships,              
              facies analysis, and geophysical methods.  Subsequent lab analysis             
              involves the dating of the sequences so they can be correlated with            
              climatic events.  Because the response of eolian and associated                
              depositional systems to climatic and other factors is the basis for            
              sequence stratigraphy, the results are expected to help formulate              
              a general process-response eolian sequence  model that will have               
              predictive capabilities with respect to changing external controls.
