Abstract    :
              This study has two main goals:  1) Determination of the age                    
              of Hf-depletions in peridotites.  A systematic study of                        
              western US peridotites is the focus of the proposed                            
              peridotite study which will further constrain the existence                    
              through time of this Hf depleted component.  2) Estimation                     
              of the degree and depth of melting using the combined Nd and                   
              Hf-isotope systematics.  Initial results show that melt                        
              parameters vary consistently with major element variations.                    
              This study will further examine the relationships between                      
              the isotopic melt parameters and the major element                             
              variations.  It will be shown that Hf and Nd isotopes can                      
              thus be used to distinguish between models for melt                            
              generation and magma extraction.
