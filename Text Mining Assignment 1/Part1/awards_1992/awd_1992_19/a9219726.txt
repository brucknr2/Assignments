Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Immobilized metal ion affinity chromatography (IMAC) has proved                
              useful in isolating proteins present in trace amounts from                     
              complex mixtures.  The objective of this award is to characterize              
              and map several IMA-adsorbents and to use the results of these                 
              studies to formulate and test protocols for the isolation of                   
              proteins from crude mixtures using cascade mode multi-affinity                 
              chromatography (CASMAC).  The first goal is to characterize new                
              gels with regard to chelating agents, metal ions and                           
              chromatography conditions.  Among other methods, adsorption                    
              isotherms and NMR will be used.  Secondly, these gels will be                  
              mapped using retention studies of amino acids, and model peptides              
              and proteins.  Thirdly, the investigators plan to develop and                  
              test protocols that allow fractionation of complex protein                     
              mixtures using CASMAC.  It is anticipated that this work will                  
              result in making adsorbents available to the scientific community              
              for both IMAC and CASMAC that offer incremental affinities for                 
              proteins and peptides, and that are specifically targeted for                  
              interaction with different amino acid side groups.  Further the                
              investigators plan to develop a rational approach using a series               
              of affinity techniques to separate complex protein mixtures                    
              effectively.
