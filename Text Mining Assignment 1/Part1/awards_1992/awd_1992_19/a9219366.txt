Abstract    :
                   This award provides partial funding to establish a multianvil             
              rock deformation facility for the Tectonophysics Laboratory in the             
              Institute of Geophysics and Planetary Physics at the University of             
              California, Riverside. The University is committed to providing the            
              remaining funds necessary.                                                     
                   The equipment will allow deformation experiments on rock                  
              samples of Earth's mantle at pressures ranging up to 25 GPa,                   
              equivalent to depths of 700 kilometers. The experiments will be                
              directed at understanding the mechanisms by which Earth's mantle               
              rocks flow at depth and how very deep-seated earthquakes originate.
