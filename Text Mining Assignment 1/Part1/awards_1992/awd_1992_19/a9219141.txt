Abstract    :
                   This award provides 43% of the funds required to acquire two              
              workstations, tape drive, and related computing hardware that will             
              be installed and operated in the Department of Geophysics at                   
              Stanford University. Stanford University has committed the                     
              remaining funds necessary for the computer system upgrade.                     
                   The equipment will be used primarily for data analysis by the             
              Crustal Geophysics Group at Stanford who carry out fundamental                 
              research into the structure, tectonics, composition and evolution              
              of Earth's lithosphere.
