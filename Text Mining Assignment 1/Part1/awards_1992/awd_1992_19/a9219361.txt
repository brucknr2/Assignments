Abstract    :
                This research is a 5-year continuation of investigations carried             
              out under two former grants dealing with earthquake source analysis            
              and earth structure.  Topics include 1) continuation of the ongoing            
              Centroid Moment Tensor (CMT) analysis; 2) refining the CMT analysis            
              procedure through the combined use of waveforms and travel time                
              observations; 3) extending the CMT procedure to the analysis of                
              smaller events by the use of teleseismic surface waves; 4) using               
              SKKS and SKS observations, in conjunction with 3D mantle models,               
              to constrain outer core structure; 5) using combined data sets to              
              obtain improved spherically symmetric reference Earth models; 6)               
              performing joint inversions for the P and S 3D-velocity structure              
              of the mantle; 7) performing modeling experiments based on joint               
              inversion of seismic and geodynamic data, as well as exploring the             
              geodynamic implications of the 3D velocity models; 8) including                
              higher frequency data in the 3D earth structure modeling                       
              experiments in order to improve radial and lateral resolution; 9)              
              developing procedures for hybrid region/global model                           
              parameterizations which will allow for proper inversions for large-            
              scale regional structure; 10) investigation of mantle anisotropy               
              and lateral variation in attenuation and how these phenomena may               
              be accounted for in the 3D modeling experiments.  The service                  
              provided by these efforts to the world seismological community,                
              especially the CMT catalog, is widely used in determination of                 
              earth structure, tectonics, and earthquake analysis.  This research            
              is a component of the National Earthquake Hazard Reduction Program.
