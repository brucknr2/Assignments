Abstract    :
                The amalgamation of crustal and oceanic lithospheric                         
              fragments along continental margins represents a fundamental                   
              process for the growth of the continents.  The southern                        
              Appalachian Mountains are a product of such an amalgamation                    
              that occurred during Paleozoic-Mesozoic time.  This project                    
              will determine the structure, timing, and nature of the                        
              fragments that comprise the Carolina Slate Belt and Milton                     
              Belt using a combined field and laboratory approach.                           
              Results will have important implications for both the                          
              evolution of continents and for the development of most                        
              major mountain belt systems of the world.
