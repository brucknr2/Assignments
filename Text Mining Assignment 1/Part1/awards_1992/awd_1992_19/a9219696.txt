Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Preliminary studies on the strawberry notch (sno) gene suggest that            
              it functions together with the genes Notch, Serrate, deltex and the            
              Enhancer of split complex in establishing a pathway of cell-cell               
              communication that leads to the specification of cell fates. The               
              sno mutation not only shares many of the phenotypes associated with            
              mutations in these genes, but also displays strong genetic                     
              interactions with them. Additionally, duplications of Notch                    
              suppress most of the phenotypes observed in sno flies. A genetic               
              analysis of sno has been completed, and it has been determined that            
              the function of sno is needed in several specific steps of                     
              development in many different tissues. The sno gene has been                   
              localized through deficiency mapping to a single band of the X-                
              chromosome. As part of this proposal, Dr. Banerjee will isolate the            
              sno gene by chromosomal walking and characterize its gene product.             
              A functional analysis will be initiated to determine the role of               
              sno in the Notch related pathway. He hopes that the                            
              characterization of sno will help us understand the molecular basis            
              for permissive interactions that are crucial in the determination              
              of cell fate.
