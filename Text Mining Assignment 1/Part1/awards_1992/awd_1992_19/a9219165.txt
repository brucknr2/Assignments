Abstract    :
              This project combines theoretical modeling with laboratory                     
              experiments of the freezing of ice floes in a wave field.  Wave and            
              sea ice interaction is a little known area of research with however            
              strong implications for both the large-scale ice dynamics, and                 
              local-scale physical and biological processes in the marginal ice              
              zone.                                                                          
              The proposed work consists of parallel investigations of                       
              computer-simulated data to determine the the relation between wave             
              characteristics and the rate and duration of floe interactions on              
              the one hand, and a series of wave tank experiments on the other               
              hand.  These experiments will evolve from a simple one-dimensional             
              wave propagating into a field of simulated ice floes to examine                
              floe movement and clustering, to two-dimensional experiments in a              
              refrigerated wave tank to study the actual freezing process which              
              is believed to involve the compaction of newly generated frazil ice            
              and the welding together of individual so-called "pancakes" into               
              successively larger ice floes.                                                 
                                                                                             
              When the surface layers of the ocean are close to the freezing                 
              point of sea water, such a process operating on the 10 cm to 1 m               
              scale, can extend the ice edge seaward extremely rapidly, with                 
              significant effects on antarctic meteorological and biological                 
              processes.
