Abstract    :
                   A novel DNA transposon was found in a chlorate resistant                  
              mutant of Arabidopsis thaliana.  The element hybridizes to several             
              distinct sequences in the Arabidopsis genome and thus is a member              
              of a new family of transposons.  Transposons are not only                      
              interesting in themselves but often prove to be important tools for            
              cloning genes and serving as gene vectors for their native genome.             
              We propose to characterize this transposon and develop it as a tool            
              for studying the genome of this important model plant system.                  
              %%%                                                                            
              Arabidopsis thaliana has become the focus of many molecular studies            
              of plant genomes because of the small size and limited repetitive              
              sequences of the genome. Although the maize transposable element Ac            
              has been useful in obtaining mutants in Arabidopsis, much effort               
              has not yet led to the cloning of a gene.  Thus the possibility of             
              an endogenous mobile element which can be characterized and                    
              possibly engineered to provide a much needed tool for the study of             
              this model plant is exciting.
