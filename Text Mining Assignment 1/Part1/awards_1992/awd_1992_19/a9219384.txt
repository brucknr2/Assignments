Abstract    :
                   The Chortis block (Honduras, El Salvador and environs)                    
              is a microcontinental block at the northwestern end of the                     
              Caribbean plate which may have been transported east from                      
              southern Mexico during the Cenozoic opening of the Cayman                      
              Trough.  However little is known about the tectonic history                    
              of this block.  This project will gather kinematic data on                     
              Cenozoic faulting to help determine slip directions and to                     
              infer stress regime and estimate displacements to see if                       
              significant Cayman Trough offset is absorbed within the                        
              block.  In an effort to place age constraints on the                           
              tectonic history, U-Pb, 40Ar/39Ar and fission track ages on                    
              granitoids and volcanic rocks will be carried out.  These                      
              data will allow testing of the hypothesis that the Chortis                     
              block originated from the truncated southern margin of                         
              Mexico, and generally improve the understanding of the                         
              transport of microcontinental blocks along a large offset                      
              transform fault.
