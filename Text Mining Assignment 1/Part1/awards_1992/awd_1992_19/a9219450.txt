Abstract    :
              9219450  Diels  Our preliminary measurements have shown that the two
              counterpropgating beams of a ring laser are not coupled in frequency.  The
              implication is that the fs (femtosecond) ring laser is an exceptionally
              sensitive detector for minute (less than 10-12 m) optical path difference
              between the counterpropagating beams. Such path difference can be induced by
              rotation rate), by electro-optic effect (a phase shift of the order of 10-6 can
              be detected with fs temporal resolution), by motion (Fresnel drag
              measurements), by magnetic fields (Faraday effect).  We propose to explopit
              these unique properties for various applications, such as detection of small
              motion, study of the dynamics of ultrafast detectors and circuits, and coherent
              interactions with 3 level (A of V configuration) systems.  We will also apply
              our understanding of the absence of coupling between counterpropagating modes
              in the fs dye laser, to develop mode-locked semiconductor ring laser with
              similar properties.  ***
