Abstract    :
                This research is to study the continental collision between India            
              and Eurasia which, because of the enormous scales involved,                    
              provides one of the best opportunities for investigating                       
              seismogenic continental tectonics in a wide variety of                         
              environments.  Most of the data to be used are the under-utilized              
              seismic records of the former Soviet Union in cooperation with a               
              Russian research group at Institute of the Physics of the Earth                
              headed by Dr. Vinnik.  Objectives of the study are 1) to                       
              investigate the nature of the phase transitions in the mantle                  
              beneath different parts of Asia and determine their relationships              
              to regional tectonics, 2) to investigate buoyancy forces in the                
              generation of the Tien Shan by means of earthquake source                      
              parameters, 3) to investigate the nature of the upper mantle                   
              beneath the Caucuses, Baikal region, and Tibet through the analysis            
              of S and SS phases, 4) to investigate the structure of the crust               
              and upper mantle in the Altai region through travel-time tomography            
              and receiver-function analysis, and 5) to investigate Kurile-                  
              Kamchatka subducting slab structure.  This research is a component             
              of the National Earthquake Hazard Reduction Program.
