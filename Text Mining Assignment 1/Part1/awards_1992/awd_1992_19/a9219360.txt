Abstract    :
              9219360  Egbert         This is a program of research to improve processing and 
              inversion methods for geomagnetic observatory arrays.  The main  goal of this
              research is to reduce the significant uncertainties  in mantle conductivity
              suggested by the large variation of  published models.  To accomplish this,
              historical and recent  geomagnetic observatory array data will be used to seek
              constraints  on large scale averages of mantle conductivity.  The research 
              involves development and application of two related methods:   multivariate
              statistical techniques for exploratory data analysis  and data reduction; and
              methods for simultaneous inversion of  observatory array data for both external
              sources and Earth  conductivity.  ***
