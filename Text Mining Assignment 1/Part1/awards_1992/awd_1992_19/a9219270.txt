Abstract    :
                   This project represents an opportunity for US scientists to               
              continue cooperation with scientists from Colombia, Costa Rica,                
              Ecuador, Germany, Panama, Switzerland, and Venezuela in the epoch              
              measurements in the Central and South America (CASA) network.  This            
              is a field program to obtain precise repeat GPS baseline                       
              measurements between 45 sites in the North Andean convergent                   
              margin.  The observations will include:  1) short baselines across             
              the Colombia trench (400 km) and the Middle America trench (540 km)            
              where we can directly measure rapid subduction rates.  2) A survey             
              network across the South Caribbean deformed belt will test                     
              predictions of aseismic subduction of Caribbean oceanic crust                  
              beneath the North Andes.  3) Baseline observations across the                  
              active Santa Marta, Romeral, and East Andean fault systems test                
              predicted shear strain models for the North Andean microplate.
