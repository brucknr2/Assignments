Abstract    :
              We will reconstruct late eocene to Miocene continental climate from            
              the oxygen isotopic composition of fossel equid enamel phosphate.              
              This interval is an important period of global climatic                        
              deterioration inferred from paleoceanographic data with scant                  
              quantitative  geochemical information from continents.  The  18O               
              mammalian apatite precipitates in equilibrium with body water,                 
              whcih reflects ingested water.  Body temperature of mammals is                 
              constant and known so  18OPO4 records  the 18O of local water sources          
              which are dominated by the global hydrologic cycle.  The  18OPO4 of            
              fossil enamel may record continetal paleoclimate.  Fossil equids               
              are ideal because they are geographically widespread, common from              
              the Eocene to late Pleistocne, and have modern analogues.  We will             
              determine the isotopic fractionation between teeth, body water, and            
              ingested water in modern equids to quantitatively reconstruct  18O             
              of ingested water  for fossil equids.  We will determine if a                  
              continental climatic signal is preserved in fossil tooth enamal;               
              if continental climate reflects the marine record in magnitude,                
              direction, and timing; and if equid evolutionary change occurred               
              concurrently with continetal climatic change.  We will analyze                 
              fossils  from Wyoming, South Dakota, and Nebraska, where fossil                
              samples are available, regional stratigraphy and chronology are                
              well known, and location near  the center of the continent is                  
              advantageous for climate studies.  Our preliminary data indicate               
              a primary signal is retained by most enamel samples and diagenesis             
              can be detected.  We will further develop criteria for evaluating              
              diagenesis   with infrared, XRD, and elemental analyses.  If                   
              diagenesis is negligible, we will develop a quantitative record of             
              late Eocene to Miocene paleoclimate from  18O of ancient                       
              precipitation.
