Abstract    :
                   This award provides 36% of the funds needed for the                       
              acquisition of a scanning electron microscope (SEM) system that                
              will be installed and operated in the Department of Geology at the             
              University of North Carolina. The facility will be accessible to               
              faculty and students from the Triangle Universities Earth Science              
              Analytical Consortium (University of North Carolina, Duke                      
              University, and North Carolina State University). The three                    
              universities are committed to providing the remaining funds                    
              necessary for this acquisition.                                                
                   The instrument system will be used in a diverse set of                    
              research and teaching applications in micropaleontology, carbonate             
              petrology, sedimentology, paleoceanography, igneous petrology, and             
              geochemistry.
