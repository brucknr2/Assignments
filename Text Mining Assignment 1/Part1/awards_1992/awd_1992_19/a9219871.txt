Abstract    :
              Despite the evident importance of cone sheets in basalt                        
              volcanic systems, cone sheet complexes are still poorly                        
              understood and their origin is the subject of several                          
              competing hypotheses. We will apply paleo-magnetic                             
              techniques to test these hypotheses in two study areas: the                    
              Cuillin Hills of Skye (Scotland) in the roots of a major                       
              early-Tertiary basaltic volcano; and Kalfafellsdalur, a                        
              deeply eroded Quaternary spreading ridge in SE Iceland.  We                    
              will use the NRM orientation to determine whether the                          
              centrally-inclined character of the sheet-intrusions is due                    
              to post-intrusion tilting.  We will determine the magma-flow                   
              direction by magnetic susceptibility anisotropy, and we will                   
              estimate thermal gradients in country rock adjacent to                         
              sheets by paleomagnetism.
