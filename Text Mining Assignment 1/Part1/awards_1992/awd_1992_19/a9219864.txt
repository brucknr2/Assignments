Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                                                                                            
              Dissimilation of sinking organic aggregates is a central issue in              
              the regulation of carbon fluxes from the ocean's surface into its              
              depths.  The role of attached bacteria in particle decomposition               
              has been unclear.  High concentrations (108-109 ml-1) of slowly                
              growing bacteria commonly found on aggregates create intense                   
              ectohydrolase activities which rapidly solubilize (0.2-2.1 d                   
              turnover time) particulate combined amino acids but allow most                 
              hydrolysate to be released into seawater.  This "uncoupled                     
              solubilization", particularly if it applies generally to                       
              aggregate's carbon pool, could have profound implications for                  
              downward flux of carbon.  Using SCUBA collected marine snow and                
              laboratory-made 14C labeled phytodetritus aggregates studies will 1)           
              quantify DOC release (measured by high temperature catalytic                   
              oxidation) and POC turnover rates and how they vary with variation             
              in colonization and enzyme activities on aggregates.  2)                       
              characterize the released DOC in terms of molecular size                       
              distribution (with molecular sieves), whether it contains colloids             
              and sub-micron particles (by transmission electron microscopy), and            
              whether some of it is refractory to bacterial utilization (or has              
              long turnover time); 3) test whether enzyme action on aggregates               
              causes differential solubilization of C, N and P.  This work will              
              be done on aggregates collected in waters off La Jolla, Santa                  
              Barbara, and at several offshore stations in Southern California               
              Bight during 4 cruises.  The proposed study will contribute to an              
              understanding of the role of attached bacteria in POC  DOC                     
              transition and hence in carbon cycling in the ocean.
