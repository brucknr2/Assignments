Abstract    :
              As ridges approach and collide, "slab-windows" develop as                      
              young, hot and anhydrous subducting slabs lose their                           
              integrity.  Arguably, the best place to study magmatism and                    
              deformation in relation to "slab-windows" is in southern                       
              Patagonian, where well defined segments of the Chile Rise                      
              have collided with the Chile trench over the last 14 Ma.                       
              The purpose of this project is to map the temporal, spatial                    
              and chemical distribution of these Patagonian "adakites" and                   
              plateau basalts in order to understand the thermal                             
              consequences of the intersections of "slab-windows" with                       
              continental crust.
