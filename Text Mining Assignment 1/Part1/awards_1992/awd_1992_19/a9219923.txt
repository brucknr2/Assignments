Abstract    :
                   This award will provide one-half the funding needed to build              
              a biaxial testing apparatus to be installed and operated in the                
              rock mechanics laboratory of the Department of Earth, Atmospheric,             
              and Planetary Sciences at the Massachusetts Institute of                       
              Technology. MIT is committed to providing the remaining funds                  
              required for the project.                                                      
                   The materials testing system will be used by the staff of the             
              rock mechanics group at MIT as an integral part of their research              
              on rock friction and its role in faulting of the Earth' crust and              
              the generation of earthquakes.
