Abstract    :
                   This award will provide one-half the funding necessary to                 
              install a position-sensitive detector as a multiple collector in               
              the ion microprobe operated in the Enrico Fermi Institute at the               
              University of Chicago. The University of Chicago is committed to               
              providing the remaining funds needed for the project.                          
                   The installation of the new detector is estimated to result               
              in a 50-fold increase in the efficiency with which the trace                   
              concentration of rare-earth elements can be measured. The PI,                  
              faculty colleagues and graduate students at Chicago make use of the            
              ion microprobe for spatially resolved (on the order of tens of                 
              micrometers) analyses of trace elements and isotopes in rock,                  
              mineral and extraterrestrial samples. Their research is aimed at               
              a better understanding of the origin of the solar system and the               
              Earth.
