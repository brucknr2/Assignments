Abstract    :
                   The initiation and development of folds in layered                        
              rocks is a fundamental phenomena, however the process                          
              involves a complex set of possible variables.  This project                    
              continues research on folding in layered materials by                          
              modeling in linear and non-linear viscous materials.  Finite                   
              element models will study how shape and strain distribution                    
              in single-layer and multilayer folds vary as a function of                     
              viscosity contrast, the exponent in a constitutive relation                    
              of power-law type, and initial shape, wavelength and layer                     
              spacing.  Results should increase understanding of the                         
              fundamental controls on the rheology of rocks deformed under                   
              natural conditions.
