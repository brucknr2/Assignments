Abstract    :
                   The case for abrupt reorganizations of the global climate                 
              system rests on the rapidity of glacial terminations and the                   
              interhemispheric synchroneity and symmetry of ice-age climatic                 
              change.  The primary goal of this project is to test this case by              
              establishing a precise anatomy of Southern Hemisphere mid-latitude             
              paleoclimate in the Chilean Andes.  If an abrupt reorganization of             
              termination, the perfected Chilean paleoclimatic record should                 
              match that of the Northern Hemisphere, particularly the North may              
              show no such correlation.  This would be a strong argument against             
              the global mode-switch hypothesis and could alternatively reflect              
              forcing by Antarctic sea ice.
