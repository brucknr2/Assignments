Abstract    :
              9219151  Clements  The research addresses the  difficult problem of optimizing 
              generation scheduling with full  network transmission constraints.   The
              problem is intractable as  stated.  The approach taken here is  to decompose
              the large problem into  three related subproblems.  One is  the familiar
              optimal power flow  problem.  Another incorporates  minimum up-time and
              down-time  constraints; it is a relatively  simple dynamic programming problem.
                The third, a quadratic programming  problem, is subject to "ramping"  and
              energy constraints.  Efficient  iterative solution of these three  subproblems
              requires the  development of specially tailored  interior point algorithms and
              the  use of innovative new ideas for  adjusting the augmented Lagragian 
              penalty parameter.   ***
