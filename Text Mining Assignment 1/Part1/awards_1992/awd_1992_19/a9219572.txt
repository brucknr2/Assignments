Abstract    :
              This award supports a study of late Cenozoic vegetation in the                 
              Transantarctic Mountains using palynology of tills and marine                  
              sediments.  The record of terrestrial vegetation in Antarctica                 
              since the onset of glaciation at about 40 Ma (Ma = million years               
              before present) is poorly known.  It was thought to have been                  
              expelled from Antarctica during a late Oligocene glaciation (30                
              Ma), and certainly lost by middle Miocene time (15 Ma).  However,              
              well-preserved twigs, leaves, roots, and pollen of Nothofagus                  
              (southern beech) and coniferous pollen are now known from the                  
              mid- to upper Pliocene Sirius Group (86oS latitude; 1800m above                
              sea level) in the Transantarctic Mountains.  Nothofaguso survival              
              until at least the late Pliocene implies a Neogene climate 15o to              
              20oC warmer than today, even during glacial periods.  Based on                 
              one interpretation, onset of the present cold polar climate, loss              
              of the plants, and growth of the present ice sheet all occurred                
              within the last 3 Ma.  If the plants, which require mean summer                
              temperatures warmer than 5oC, grew at high elevations (1500m) in               
              the Transantarctic Mountains, then a lush vegetation should have               
              grown at sea-level which should have produced a rich pollen                    
              record in Pliocene coastal sediments.  The goals of this study                 
              are to understand the late Cenozoic vegetation history of the                  
              continent and thereby to constrain models for the history of the               
              Antarctic ice sheets and to resolve the question of Pliocene                   
              warming in the southern hemisphere.
