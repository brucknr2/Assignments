Abstract    :
              The proposed research will elucidate the relationship                          
              between density and coordination changes of Al3+, Fe3+ and                     
              Ti4+ in silicate melts.   Experiments are designed to obtain                   
              precise measurements of  melt density using the double-bob                     
              Archimedean method over a range of compositions and                            
              temperatures at a pressure of one bar.   The proposed                          
              density measurements will complement information on melt                       
              structure obtained by NMR, Raman and IR spectroscopy.                          
              Properties such as density, and the factors that affect                        
              them,  are fundamental in studies of magma evolution - -                       
              they affect melt segregration at the source region, magma                      
              ascent through diapirs and fractures, and the processes that                   
              produce chemical diversification in magmas.
