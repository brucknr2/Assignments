Abstract    :
                   PI and collaborators will conduct a carbon isotopic study to              
              locate the Paleocene/Eocene boundary, by its postulated carbon                 
              isotope excursion, in the classic marine and non-marine sections               
              in northwestern Europe.  This boundary marks an important                      
              paleoceanographic and paleobiologic shift, currently the focus of              
              interest for a large group.  This study will also facilitate                   
              attempts to reconstruct depositional history of the European basins            
              in a sequence stratigraphic framework.  Detailed sampling of                   
              sections in Paris and Belgian basins will be followed by isotopic              
              analyses of soil carbonates, marine micro- and macrofossils.                   
              Microfossil correlation will use DSDP Site 550 on Goban Spur, which            
              also provides a carbon isotope-reference section.
