Abstract    :
              This award is for support of a project to evaluate processes                   
              occurring at the grounding line of polar glaciers in order to                  
              constrain both glaciological and oceanographic models.  A Remotely-            
              Operated Submersible Vehicle (ROV) will be used to help obtain the             
              data.  The project will examine the physical processes involved in             
              the release of debris from the glacier and its dispersal in the                
              ice-proximal marine environment.  Sedimentary processes, surface               
              sedimentary facies, and biological communities will be studied to              
              improve interpretation of older glacial sedimentary facies.
