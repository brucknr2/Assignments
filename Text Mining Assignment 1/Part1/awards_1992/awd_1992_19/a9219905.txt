Abstract    :
                   This award provides funding for the acquisition of a mass                 
              spectrometer to be installed and operated in the Department of                 
              Geosciences at the University of Houston. The instrument will be               
              devoted primarily to isotopic analysis of argon gas in order to                
              determine ages of formation and the chronology of heating-cooling              
              cycles in igneous, metamorphic and sedimentary rocks using                     
              potassium-argon radioactive decay techniques. An ability to                    
              determine temperature-time histories in crustal rocks is the key               
              to understanding  a variety of tectonic problems, evaluating fossil            
              fuel and geothermal energy sources, and deciphering the pattern of             
              volcanism in active volcanic provinces. This laboratory facility               
              will also be available for use by researchers at Rice University               
              and other regional research organizations.
