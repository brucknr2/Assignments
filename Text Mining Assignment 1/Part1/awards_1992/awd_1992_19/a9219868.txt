Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              With National Science Foundation support Dr. Long and his                      
              colleagues will continue their research both to improve the                    
              radiocarbon dating technique and to provide accurate dates at a                
              reasonable cost and in reasonable time to the archaeological                   
              community. The laboratory will continue to seek out and analyze                
              samples of anthropological significance. It will apply techniques              
              which allow the dating of non-standard materials such as pollen and            
              individual bone amino acids to such samples. It will also continue             
              research to improve the dating technique itself and will focus on              
              the cause, nature of impurities in benzene which is used in liquid             
              scintillation counting.                                                        
                                                                                             
              To work most effectively, archaeologists need to assign absolute               
              ages to excavated materials and radiocarbon dating has provided the            
              primary technique for accomplishing this goal. Organic materials               
              such as charcoal dating to 40,000 years or less are routinely dated            
              by this means and Dr. Long's laboratory is now able to extend the              
              technique's range to ca. 70,000 years. The laboratory also has the             
              ability both to analyze very small amounts of material and to                  
              purify contaminated remains such as bone. Through such dating work,            
              the laboratory has addressed important anthropological questions               
              such as when plants were first domesticated in the New World and               
              thus shed light on the development of cultural complexity.                     
                                                                                             
              This grant is important because it will permit the laboratory to               
              continue both its service and method development functions. It will            
              aid many archaeologists in their research.
