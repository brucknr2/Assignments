Abstract    :
                   The structure, stability and thermal properties of high                   
              pressure mineral phases composed of MgO, CaO, SiO2 and A12O3, as               
              well as low pressure phases of SiO2, will be investigated with                 
              several theoretical and numerical methods.  Interionic/atomic                  
              potentials and forces will be derived from first principles                    
              pseudopotential calculations and electron gas theories.  The                   
              principal aim of the project is to explore possible phase                      
              relationships of minerals that might be found in the earth's mantle            
              and crust, and to examine their elastic properties.  Of particular             
              interest is the interplay between pressure and temperature effects             
              on seismic velocities, and the examination of high temperature                 
              phases related to (mg,Fe)SiO3 perovskite and products of solid                 
              solution with CaSiO3 perovskite and A12O3.  Another major goal is              
              the development of parametric Hamiltonian models of covalent                   
              bonding in silicate phases present in the crust and upper mantle.              
              A collateral goal is the development of present computational                  
              techniques into a form that can be used profitably by nonexperts.
