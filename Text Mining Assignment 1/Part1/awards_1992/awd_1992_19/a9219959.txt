Abstract    :
                   Arabidopsis thaliana has recently been developed as a model               
              host system to study the molecular genetics if plant pathogen                  
              interactions.  This has allowed us to propose a series of                      
              definitive genetic experiments to dissect the molecular basis of               
              recognition and potential signal transduction events involved in               
              plant disease resistance.  We propose to genetically dissect both              
              race-specific and systemic acquired disease resistance by                      
              identifying and characterizing disease susceptible mutants that are            
              altered in the expression of disease resistance.  The mutants will             
              be phenotypically and genetically characterized to ascertain how               
              many loci control the expression of disease resistance in both                 
              types of resistance.  Our research will then focus on the avrB-                
              specific disease susceptible mutants and will employ these mutants             
              to clone the RPG1 disease resistance locus by the techniques of                
              chromosome walking and/or T-DNA tagging.

              The ease with which mutations in Arabidopsis can be isolated,                  
              genetically mapped, and corresponding wild type loci cloned                    
              circumvents many disadvantages encountered in the study of other               
              plant species with more complex genomes and puts us in a unique                
              position to clone the RPG1 disease resistance locus which can then             
              be used to determine if the same resistance locus is present in                
              commercially important crop plants.
