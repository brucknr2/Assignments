Abstract    :
                   Arc-continent collision during the Mesozoic was a                         
              dominant tectonic process along the western margin of north                    
              America.  Jurassic events associated with this process were                    
              interpreted to involve a period of short-lived deformation                     
              and metamorphism in the late Jurassic, however recent                          
              evidence suggests that deformation began in the Middle                         
              Jurassic, and that the southern part of the orogen underwent                   
              extension while the northern part underwent shortening.                        
              This project will examine the timing of orogenesis in the                      
              Black Rock Desert of northwest Nevada and the Pine Nut Range                   
              of west-central Nevada to address these details, and will                      
              employ filed, petrologic and U/Pb and Ar/Ar age dating                         
              techniques.  Results should provide new data for refining                      
              the regional variations in timing of Jurassic deformation.
