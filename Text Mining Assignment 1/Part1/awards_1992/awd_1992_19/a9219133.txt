Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                                                                                            
              Support is being provided for the Eleventh Dissertations Symposium             
              on Chemical Oceanography (DISCO) to be held March 29-April 2, 1993             
              at the East-West Center, University of Hawaii Campus, Honolulu,                
              Hawaii.  For five days twenty-six chemical oceanography candidates             
              will meet informal and informal sessions to present their                      
              dissertations, to broaden their perspectives in the field, and to              
              participate in working groups to develop recommendations concerning            
              chemical oceanography research and education.  In turn, they will              
              be informed of the research climate and opportunities for support              
              by the federal agency sponsors.  The proceedings will be published.            
              This will be the eleventh in a very successful series of symposia              
              supported by the National Science Foundation (NSF), Office of Naval            
              Research (ONR), and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric                       
              Administration (NOAA).
