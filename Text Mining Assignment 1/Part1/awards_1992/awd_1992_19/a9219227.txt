Abstract    :
              Baculoviruses, insect viruses, are the focus of intense interest               
              because of their remarkable ability to hyperexpress and process                
              foreign eukaryotic genes and their potential use as insecticides.              
              Despite this widespread interest, the mechanism by which                       
              baculoviruses replicate is unknown. This proposal is based upon                
              recent work in our laboratory which identified and characterized               
              the origins of replication from two baculoviruses genomes, the                 
              first time such sequences have been identified. The long term goal             
              of this project is to use plasmids containing replication origin               
              sequences to develop a detailed understanding of the mechanism by              
              which DNA is replicated in baculoviruses. This includes the                    
              characterization of the structure of the origins of DNA                        
              replication, the identification of genes necessary to the process,             
              and elucidating the function of those genes. Since the                         
              transcription of the late genes is dependent upon DNA replication,             
              the results of this work should also make it possible to elucidate             
              the processes involved in late transcription.

              Information derived from this project will not only enhance our                
              understanding of a basic biological mechanism but will also be of              
              practical use, in that it will facilitate the design of recombinant            
              baculovirus for use as expression vectors and as insecticides.
