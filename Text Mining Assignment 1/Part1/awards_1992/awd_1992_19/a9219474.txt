Abstract    :
              Professor James Skinner is supported by a grant from the                       
              Theoretical and Computational Chemistry Program to continue                    
              his work in studies of relaxation, spectroscopy, and                           
              transport in condensed phases.  Skinner employs a model                        
              system consisting of two quantum levels coupled to a quantum                   
              mechanical bath which is used for studies of relaxation                        
              processes, and has applications to many different branches                     
              of spectroscopy.  In the usual approach it is assumed that                     
              the coupling between the quantum levels and the bath is                        
              weak, and that the initial density matrix factors into a                       
              product of density matrices for the quantum levels and one                     
              for the bath.  Skinner's approach differs in that his                          
              studies of the relaxation properties of the reduced density                    
              matrix do not involve either of these two assumptions.                         
              Skinner will develop a microscopic theory of inhomogeneous                     
              lineshapes in crystals which he will apply to results of                       
              several experiments.  He also will develop a statistical                       
              mechanical dynamical theory of electronic spectroscopy in                      
              liquids and dense gases such as supercritical fluids.

              The last decade has shown that disorder is responsible for                     
              many important properties of materials.  In addition, the                      
              transport of electrons in condensed matter, which has                          
              important implications for biology and solar energy                            
              collection, is greatly affected by disorder.  Skinner's                        
              research provides important insights at the molecular level                    
              which will lead to a clearer understanding of the way in                       
              which disorder influences the important material properties                    
              of condensed phase chemical systems.
