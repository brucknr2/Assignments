Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This proposal is directed to the study of presynaptic NMDA-type                
              glutamate receptors that are likely to be involved in the                      
              autoregulation of synaptic transmitter release.  NMDA receptors are            
              widely distributed in the central nervous system of all animals and            
              are intimately involved in normal neural processes such as learning            
              and memory as well as a number of pathological processes.  Little              
              is known of the presynaptic receptor function or structure since               
              there has not been an available source of receptors that are not               
              contaminated by the presence of the postsynaptic receptors in mixed            
              and complex neural tissues.  Because the olfactory epithelium is               
              composed of a pure population of neuronal cells and that it is a               
              presynaptic element the epithelium neurons can be a unique source              
              of the genetic message and receptor proteins that can be used to               
              generate the molecular tools to study presynaptic structure and                
              function of the various neurotransmitter and modulator receptors               
              that may exist there.
