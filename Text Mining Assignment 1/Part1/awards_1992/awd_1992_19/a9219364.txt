Abstract    :
                   This award provides 38% of the funds required for the                     
              acquisition of a thermal ionization mass spectrometer to be                    
              installed and operated in the Department of Geological Sciences at             
              Cornell University. The University is committed to providing the               
              remaining funds needed for the acquisition.                                    
                   The mass spectrometer system will be primarily used in the                
              research programs of the Principal Investigator, several additional            
              faculty members of the Department of Geological Sciences, and their            
              students in research projects supported by the National Science                
              Foundation. These projects employ the radiometric dating and                   
              isotopic tracing techniques of isotope geochemistry and include                
              topics such as the evolution of the Archean crust and the mantle,              
              the origin of the Galapagos and Marquesa islands, the isotopic                 
              composition of seawater, and the study of magmatism in the Andes.
