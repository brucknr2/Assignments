Abstract    :
              This award is for support of a two year study to continue                      
              systematic core studies of piston cores obtained beneath Ice                   
              Stream B on the West Antarctic Ice Sheet.  The study aims to test              
              the theory that by lubricating the glacier bed, the till is                    
              responsible for the rapid ice-streaming motion.  Measurements                  
              will be conducted on both existing core materials as well as on                
              new samples to be acquired as part of this and other currently                 
              funded projects.  Samples will also be examined for their content              
              of microfossils, which will provide information about the glacial              
              and climatic history of West Antarctica.
