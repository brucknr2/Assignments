Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This study addresses measurement of local convective surface                   
              rainfall and attendant surface and boundary layer atmospheric                  
              variables, on the creation of a prototype database for fundamental             
              studies on rainfall properties and dynamics, and on the                        
              determination of predictability properties of local surface                    
              convective rainfall.  The significance for hydrology is that the               
              study will: (1) enhance the hydrologic database of rainfall and                
              other storm data with very-fine resolution data with beneficial                
              consequences for studies on the statistical and dynamical                      
              properties of surface rainfall and its extremes, (2) assess the                
              fundamental dynamical and microphysical mechanisms at work during              
              the occurrence of heavy surface rainfall with beneficial                       
              consequences for efforts devoted to dynamical parameterizations,               
              (3) provide predictability measures that would be very beneficial              
              for hydrologic studies of hazardous flood events.  A host of                   
              specially calibrated instruments for surface meteorological                    
              measurements, including very sensitive optical raingauges and a                
              phased array wind profiler will be used for measurement of                     
              convective events in three locations in Iowa City, Iowa during four            
              spring and summer months of each of the two project years.  The                
              quality-controlled data will be used to create a prototype database            
              that would be made available (together with documentation) to the              
              scientific community for fundamental studies.  The data will also              
              be used to aid in the formulation of mathematical models of heavy              
              rainfall that are physics-based and consistent with the observed               
              temporal features of the process and that could be used to assess              
              the predictability properties of local surface rainfall.//
