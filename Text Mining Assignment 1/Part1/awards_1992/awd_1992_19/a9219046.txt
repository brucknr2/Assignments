Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The Drosophila abnormal gastrulation (noga) gene was identified in             
              a genetic screen for mutations mapping in the 71C-F interval of                
              chromosome 3. Six alleles of this embryonic lethal locus were                  
              recovered. In noga mutant embryos, a defective gastrulation is                 
              observed in that the ventral furrow fails to form properly, and the            
              cephalic furrow and posterior midgut invagination occur abnormally.            
              The underlying reasons for this defective gastrulation phenotype               
              are currently unknown; a mutation in noga may result in an                     
              alteration of cell fate along the dorsoventral axis or a mutation              
              in noga may cause abnormalities in the cell shape changes, cell                
              movements, or cell-cell interactions necessary for gastrulation.               
              The specific goals of the research on the noga gene are the                    
              following: 1) further characterize the noga mutant phenotype; 2)               
              isolation and molecular characterization the noga gene; 3) a study             
              of noga gene expression during normal embryogenesis; and 4) an                 
              investigation of the function of the noga gene in gastrulation.                
              Overall, the further phenotypic and molecular analysis of this                 
              interesting gene should provide important information on                       
              dorsoventral patterning and/or gastrulation in the Drosophila                  
              embryo.
