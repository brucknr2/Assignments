Abstract    :
                   In an interdisciplinary effort among geologists and                       
              statisticians, this project seeks to improve methods of time                   
              correlation in stratigraphy.  By combining the best aspects of                 
              existing methods of graphical correlation with operations research,            
              PIs will develop a solution in the form of constrained                         
              optimization.  One part of the procedure seeks the best sequence               
              of first and last appearance events, allowing subjective judgments             
              about quality of data; a second part positions the events along a              
              time scale by adding simplifying assumptions about accumulation                
              rates.  Repeated, rapid trials expose the consequences of different            
              judgments and assumptions.  Procedure will be applied to a mid-                
              Ordovician correlation problem in the Great Basin.
