Abstract    :
                This research will map the orientation and extent of anisotropy              
              in both the suboceanic and subcontinental upper mantle.  The                   
              analysis will be done by means of differences between azimuthal                
              velocity variations of the two quasi-shear phases produced by shear            
              wave incidence on an anisotropic medium.  The primary dataset will             
              be intermediate-period and broadband records from global digital               
              catalogs and digitized long-period records from the WWSSN.                     
              Preliminary analysis of S and SS phases that traverse the North                
              Atlantic shows potential examples of shear-wave splitting that                 
              support the presence of upper mantle anisotropy.
