Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  This award provides funds which will allow the University of              
              Southern California to host a scientific workshop in Wellington,               
              New Zealand in preparation to submit to the NSF a complete                     
              scientific proposal to study the Southern Alps plate boundary of               
              New Zealand.  This workshop will have two primary objectives: (A)              
              to review the scientific objectives of the proposed research and               
              (B) to review the logistical and technical considerations of the               
              proposed field experiments.  Results of the workshop will be                   
              twofold:  (1) a report summarizing the results of the workshop and             
              (2) an updated scientific plan for the proposed project.
