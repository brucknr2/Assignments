Abstract    :
                This research is a study of lithospheric strength and tectonics              
              by continued tomographic studies of lateral variations in Pn                   
              velocity and crustal thickness.  The goals include tomographic                 
              mapping of Pn velocity and crustal thickness; modelling the effects            
              of complex crust and mantle structure on Pn travel times; and                  
              interpreting the results in light of regional tectonics.  Past work            
              has mapped Pn in the Middle East, Central Asia, and the western                
              United States.  This work will extend that mapping into Europe and             
              into Indochina.  The data bases consist of ISC travel time data and            
              travel times that are determined in this project.  Ultimately, the             
              quantitative knowledge of uppermost mantle velocity, crustal                   
              thickness, and other geophysical parameters will be used to link               
              the tectonics and geology seen at the surface of the earth to the              
              mantle beneath in order to gain insight into the processes that                
              shape the earth's surface.
