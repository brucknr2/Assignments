              90-18606 Jurassic Extensional Arc-Continental Rift                             
              transition, Mojave-Sonoran Deserts.  The work involves study                   
              along the Sawmill Canyon fault zone in southern Arizona,                       
              that shows the interrelations of grabens, calderas and                         
              basement structures in a transtensional arc setting.
