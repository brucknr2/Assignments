Abstract    :
              9219998  Murray    In vitro methods will be used to study gap junction function
              and  gap junction gene regulation following treatment of cells with  compounds
              known to influence junction formation and to promote  adrenal steroidogenesis. 
              Specifically, the effect of  adrenocorticotropin (ACTH), DbcAMP, forskolin, and
              cAMP-dependent  protein kinase (pKA) activity on gap junction expression will
              be  studied with gap junction cDNA clones.  Y-1 mouse and SW-13 human 
              adrenocortical cell lines and primary cultures of adult rat adrenal  cortical
              cells will be used.  Gap junction expression will be  characterized and
              localized with immunohistochemistry, western blot  and northern blot analysis. 
              Evidence of cell communication will be  obtained with Lucifer yellow dye
              transfer experiments.  Vectors  containing cDNA antisense and antibody directed
              against gap  junction gene products (Cx43) will be introduced into cells to 
              determine the effect of inhibition of gap junction expression.  The  effect of
              over-expression of gap junctions on adrenal cell function  will be studied in
              cells transfected with gap junction cDNA.  These  studies will give insight
              into the relationship of junctional  communication to the hormone response. 
              %%%  Gap junctions are structures that connect cells to one another in  certain
              tissues, in certain stages of development, and/or during  certain functional
              states.  These structures are pathways by which  cells communicate by passage
              of chemical messengers.  This research  will use techniques of molecular
              biology to examine the effect of  hormones on gap junction formation and
              function.  The results of  these studies will increase our knowledge of how
              hormones affect  the way cells communicate with one another.  ***
