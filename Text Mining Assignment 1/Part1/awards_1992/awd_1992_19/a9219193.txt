Abstract    :
                   This is an experimental investigation of the shapes of melt               
              inclusions in upper mantle partial melts.  This investigation is               
              motivated by the observation that the crystal-melt morphology of               
              experimentally produced samples is not consistent with                         
              theoretically predicted smoothly curved crystal-melt interfaces.               
              The melt geometry has a paramount effect on seismic velocities, and            
              the data can be applied to model the upper mantle velocity                     
              structure in the presence of melt.  Analysis of digital                        
              backscattered electron images of the post-run samples will be used             
              to obtain the parameters needed (such as the aspect ration of melt             
              inclusions, their area, the total melt fraction) to calculate                  
              seismic velocities, based on established models of elastic,                    
              anelasic and electrical properties of partially molten rocks.  This            
              is a promising new approach to characterize the melt distribution              
              in upper mantle systems.
