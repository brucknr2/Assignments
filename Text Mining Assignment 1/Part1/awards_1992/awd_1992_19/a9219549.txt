Abstract    :
                   The Norumbega Fault Zone in Maine is a major feature                      
              long considered to be a dextral strike-slip fault system.                      
              Preliminary observations suggest however that the NE-SW                        
              striking fault zone represents a partial crustal profile of                    
              a major transcurrent boundary, with significantly different                    
              crustal levels exposed along strike.  This project is aimed                    
              at taking advantage of this feature to characterize the                        
              styles of metamorphism and deformation processes with                          
              increasing depth in the crust.  It will employ detailed                        
              mapping, petrology and Ar/Ar geochronology to constrain                        
              timing of deformation events, along four areas or transects                    
              along strike.  Results will elucidate the tectonic                             
              significance of this fault zone in the development of the                      
              Appalachian orogen.
