Abstract    :
                The experimental methods in the proposed research involve the                
              cloning and sequencing of gap junction genes from the tobacco                  
              budworm and the fruitfly.  Gap junction  gene fragments will be                
              isolated from cDNA libraries by polymerase chain reaction                      
              amplification using PCR primers synthesized from candidate insect              
              gap junction protein sequence already in hand.  PCR products will              
              be cloned, sequenced, and used to screen insect cDNA libraries for             
              full length gap junction genes.  Candidate genes will be molecular             
              characterized and confirmed to code for authentic gap junction                 
              protein in functional Xenopus oocyte expression assays and by                  
              immunocytochemistry.  Nucleic acid and antibody probes will be                 
              developed against gap junction genes and their proteins for use in             
              future studies which will utilize Drosophila as a model for                    
              investigations on the role of gap junctions in tissue growth and               
              patterning in multicellular animals.                                           
              %%%                                                                            
              The goal of the proposed research is to characterize at a molecular            
              level the gap junctions in insects.  Gap junctions consist of                  
              plasma membrane-associated protein channels through which ions and             
              small molecules pass directly between cells.  Gap junctions are                
              thought to be involved in the cellular exchange of signalling                  
              molecules which regulate tissue growth and patterning.  Drosophila             
              provides a powerful experimental model to investigate the                      
              involvement of gap junction-mediated intercellular communication in            
              development.
