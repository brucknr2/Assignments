Abstract    :
                   PIs will conduct an interdisciplinary investigation,                      
              employing sedimentology, stratigraphy, paleontology,                           
              paleoecology, and geochemistry, all designed to determine                      
              the causes and effects of high-frequency sea-level changes                     
              in the Cenomanian-Turonian Western Interior Seaway of North                    
              America.  Objectives are:  1) to confirm hypothesis that                       
              parasequences in the fine-grained, offshore facies record                      
              processes of at least regional extent, 2) to determine how                     
              spatial changes in accommodation space and rate of sediment                    
              influx influenced development of sequences and parasequences                   
              during high-frequency relative sea-level changes, 3) to                        
              evaluate how, and by what mechanisms, benthic oxygenation                      
              levels at offshore sites varied in concert with high-                          
              frequency sea-level changes, and 4) to determine how water                     
              column characteristics varied over the course of such                          
              changes.
