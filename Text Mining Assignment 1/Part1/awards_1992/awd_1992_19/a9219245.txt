Abstract    :
              9219245  WEIDNER, Donald J.       This project is to examine the phase
              equilibria for the  olivine system at the pressures and temperatures of the 400
              km  discontinuity.  The experiments will be carried out with SAM-85,  a cubic
              anvil high pressure system used in conjunction with the  NSLS synchrotron.  The
              major advantage of this system is that the  pressure in the sample cell is
              continuously monitored.  This is  essential to directly associate a seismic
              discontinuity at a depth  in the earth with a phase transition observed in the
              lab where the  pressure scale may be precise but inaccurate.  In addition, 
              univariant reactions can be reversed in a single experimental run  and bounds
              on the equilibrium pressure and temperature determined  directly.
