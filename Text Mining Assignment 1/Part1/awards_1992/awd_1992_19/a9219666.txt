Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This project, which will begin its tenth year of support from the              
              NSF, addresses one of the critical questions in developmental                  
              biology: how do aa relatively small number of embryonic cells give             
              rise to the multitude of cell types that make up the individual?               
              An ideal model system in which this question can be addressed is               
              the neural crest, which appears very early in the development in               
              all vertebrate species.  Although the neural crest is only                     
              recognizable for a few days during the course of development, it               
              gives rise to a myriad of important structures in the body.  Among             
              the hundreds of neural crest derivatives is the entire peripheral              
              nervous system, all of the pigment cells in the skin and the cells             
              that make the dentin in the teeth.  How are such an enormous number            
              of diverse cell types made from a seemingly homogeneous population             
              of cells in a normal individual?  With previous NSF support, this              
              laboratory devised sophisticated cell sorting techniques for                   
              isolating and studying subpopulations of neural crest cells.                   
              Furthermore, they can transplant neural crest cells and follow the             
              transplanted cells throughout development.  The current studies                
              will specifically examine how individual neuronal cell types arise             
              from the neural crest by examining the development of two                      
              identified subpopulations following transplantation.  The events               
              that direct apparently homogeneous neural crest cells to become                
              specific neurons will be examined, and the specific control genes              
              that are associated with these events will be identified.  These               
              studies are at the interface of cellular and molecular biology,                
              where, for the first time, it is now possible to address one of the            
              most fundamental questions in developmental neuroscience.
