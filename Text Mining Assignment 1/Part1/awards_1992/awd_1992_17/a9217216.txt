Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This three-year award supports U.S.-France cooperative research                
              in chemistry between Teddy G. Traylor of the University of                     
              California, San Diego, and Daniel Mansuy of the Universite Rene                
              Descartes, Paris, France.  The objective of their research is to               
              develop effective catalysts using hydrogen peroxide, dioxygen, or              
              other oxidants.  They will examine the potential of catalysts,                 
              known as metal porphyrins, which have electronegatively                        
              substituted substituents.  These will be converted into water                  
              soluble forms, soap-like materials, and polymers, and then                     
              attached to solid surfaces.  The project takes advantage of                    
              complementary expertise of the U.S. and French investigators in                
              both porphyrin chemistry and in oxidation catalysis.                           
                                                                                             
              Catalyzed oxidations of organics, as proposed in this project,                 
              have important laboratory and industrial applications. The                     
              proposed research could result in significant new catalysts for                
              the oxidation of organic molecules using readily available and                 
              inexpensive oxidants, such as hydrogen peroxide.
