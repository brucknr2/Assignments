Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              A series of laboratory experiments will be conducted to investigate            
              the structure of the molecular boundary just beneath the air-sea               
              interface and the effects of wave and surface active films on mass             
              exchange processes.  Newly developed chemical, optical aand image-             
              processing technologies will be used to make the necessary detailed            
              observations.
