Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This award supports the participation of 14 U.S. scientists in a               
              U.S.-Japan Seminar on Dynamics, Photophysical and Photochemical                
              Events Involving Clusters, to be held in Hawaii December 16-19,                
              1993.  The co-organizers are Professor A. W. Castleman, Jr. of                 
              Pennsylvania State University and Professor Tamotsu Kondow of the              
              University of Tokyo.  In addition to the U.S. and Japanese                     
              participants, a scientist from Germany has been invited.                       
                                                                                             
              During the last decade or so, there has been a dramatic growth of              
              activity in the field of cluster research.  Reference to clusters              
              permeates the literature of a very broad cross section of basic                
              and applied science from that dealing with condensed matter and                
              surfaces to interstellar space.  In particular, clusters provide               
              a unique way of investigating properties of matter at different                
              degrees of aggregation and therefore yield information on                      
              changing properties and reactivity that serves to bridge the gas               
              and condensed state.                                                           
                                                                                             
              The seminar is organized around eight general topics in the area               
              of the dynamics of isolated cluster systems:  electronic effects;              
              electron solvation; cluster spectroscopy and structure; cluster                
              properties, structure, and formation; dynamics and photophysical               
              events; reactions in hydrogen bonded and van Der Waals systems;                
              reactions of semiconcuctor and metallic systems; and collisions                
              with surfaces and condensed matter.  This meeting, which will                  
              emphasize recent advances and develop ideas for future research                
              direction, should lead to collaborative research activities                    
              between U.S. and Japanese scientists in this important field.
