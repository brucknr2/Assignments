Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              In this project, the P.I,s will perform modal analysis,m and                   
              electron and ion probe analysis of the minerals in abyssal                     
              peridotites recovered from MAR in the vicinity of 15o20' Fracture              
              Zone.  The intriguing aspect of the 15o20' FZ is that an unusual               
              large duniteharzburgite complex is exposed here.  Their objective              
              is to evaluate the origin of this complex and the magmatic                     
              processes which operate at local scales and control the composition            
              of the oceanic crust.
