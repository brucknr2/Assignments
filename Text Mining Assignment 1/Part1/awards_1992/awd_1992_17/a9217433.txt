Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This U.S.-Mexico award will help to support joint                              
              research between groups headed by Dr. D. V. Reddy of                           
              the Center for Marine Structures and Geotechnique at                           
              Florida Atlantic University and Dr. Lorenzo Martinez                           
              of the National University of Mexico (UNAM).  The                              
              purpose of the collaboration is to address the                                 
              effects of new materials on the durability behavior                            
              of reinforced/prestressed/post-tensioned concrete.                             
              The proposed experiments will study changes in                                 
              concrete durability that result from the use of                                
              different types of cement.  Mix design variables,                              
              such as concrete strength, air content, slump, and                             
              water-cement ratio, will be studied for their                                  
              effects on durability.                                                         
                                                                                             
              The magnitude of the durability problem is                                     
              considerable enough to merit national and                                      
              international action.  The cost of current                                     
              replacement and repair requirements in the concrete                            
              infrastructure, caused by inadequate durability, are                           
              conservatively estimated to be billions of dollars.                            
              This study will improve the scientific understanding                           
              of deterioration of reinforced concrete, provide                               
              improved interpretation of the actual behavior, and                            
              develop guidelines for estimating life expectancy.
