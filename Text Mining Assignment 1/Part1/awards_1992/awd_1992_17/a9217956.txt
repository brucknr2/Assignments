Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This project will explore the feasibility of using supercritical               
              wetting to introduce binary mixtures into highly porous silica                 
              gels.  A two-step process will be employed:  supercritical drying              
              (removing the solvent at temperatures and pressures above its gas-             
              liquid critical point where it evaporates without surface tension,             
              and then reversing the procedure to add the new solvent via                    
              supercritical wetting.  This new approach should preserve the fine             
              structure of the gel and allow us to study the effects of                      
              randomness, confinement, and wetting on the structure, dynamics and            
              phase transitions of a variety of non-water based fluid mixtures in            
              an important class of porous media.                                            
              %%%                                                                            
              The confinement of fluids within porous media can lead to dramatic             
              and complex changes in their physical behavior due to finite size              
              effects, wetting, and geometrical and chemical randomness in pore              
              size and structure.  This investigation will employ non-water-based            
              solutions.  Besides their fundamental scientific, such studies are             
              also of great practical-importance in areas such as secondary oil              
              recovery techniques and containment of societal wastes in landfills            
              and nuclear waste in underground storage sites.
