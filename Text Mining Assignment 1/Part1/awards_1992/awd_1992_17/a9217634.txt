Abstract    :
              This award is for support of a study to reconstruct the spatial and            
              temporal pattern of pre-late Wisconsin glacial and sea-level                   
              fluctuations of the north-eastern Bristol Bay region of                        
              southwestern Alaska.  A wide spectrum of geochronological methods,             
              including aminostratigraphy, tephrostratigraphy, thermolumi-                   
              nescence, and radiocarbon dating will be used to date the                      
              stratigraphic records that are available.  An improved                         
              chronostratigraphy will allow the spatial and temporal variability             
              in the response of the glacial and periglacial systems to be                   
              assessed in terms of the changing oceanic and atmospheric boundary             
              conditions of the last interglacial to late-Wisconsin time.
