Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This award supports a two-year collaborative research project                  
              between Professor Mark S. Gordon of Iowa State University and                  
              Professor Kazuo Takatsuka of Nagoya University.  Also involved on              
              the U.S. side are Professor George Schatz of Northwestern                      
              University and Professor Vincent McKoy of the California Institute             
              of Technology.  In Japan Satoshi Yabushita of Hiroshima University             
              and Kimihiko Hirao of Nagoya University are also involved.                     
                                                                                             
              This project will address one of the most important new                        
              developments in chemistry during the past five years -- the                    
              experimental ability developed by Neumark and others to directly               
              study reaction transition states by performing photodetachment of              
              an electron from related anions and then studying the subsequent               
              photodetachment spectroscopy and dynamics.  The investigators, all             
              theoretical chemists, will attack this problem from several                    
              complementary perspectives, including electronic structure theory,             
              dynamics based on both time-dependent and time-independent                     
              formalisms, and photoionization spectroscopy and dynamics.  By                 
              combining complementary expertise, the U.S. and Japanese groups                
              will be able to develop insights that build on current                         
              collaborations.
