Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                   Coral  reef  fishes  occur as local  populations  occupying              
              patches of habitat.  These populations comprise the basis of  one              
              of  the  most  speciose  assemblages of  marine  organisms,  with              
              hundreds  of  species coexisting locally.  Our knowledge  of  the              
              ecolgical  processes  that limit population  size  is  scant  and              
              historically  has been biased toward studies of competition,  and              
              more  recently, recruitment (the process of young fish  appearing              
              on  a reef following settlement of planktonic larvae).  Due to  a              
              variety  of logistic constraints, other processes have  not  been              
              thoroughly studied.  This is especially true of predation,  which              
              has  been  demonstrated to be an extremely important  process  in              
              other marine, freshwater, and terrestrial communities.                         
                   Dr. Hixon will investigate two corollaries of the hypothesis              
              that predation limits local population sizes in reef-fishes:  (1)              
              survivorship  of  newly settled fish will be  enhanced  on  reefs              
              where resident and/or transient piscivorous fish are removed; and              
              (2) these effects on survivorship will vary with the magnitude of              
              recruitment.   These  will  be tested by controlled  experimental              
              manipulations of predatory fish on isolated patch  reefs  at  two              
              sites:  Lee Stocking Island in the Bahamas, and St. Thomas in the              
              U. S. Virgin Islands.
