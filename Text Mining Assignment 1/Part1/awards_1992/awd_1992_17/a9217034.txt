Abstract    :
                   Past studies indicate that tropical paleoclimatology is                   
              influenced by the seasonality of solar insolation due to the                   
              precession of the equinox and by extratropical boundary conditions.            
              However, the mechanisms by which tropical climate is influenced                
              are not well understood.  This award supports a study with three               
              main objectives:  1.  to understand, using ocean models, the                   
              Sensitivity of the Upper Ocean to changes in boundary conditions               
              (insolation and winds, and extratropical conditions); 2.  to                   
              predict past wind fields from Observations of Past Upper Ocean                 
              Changes, such as thermocline structure changes; and 3.  to Compare             
              Observations with Realistic Model Runs of past times in order to               
              understand the physical link between changes in tropical winds and             
              observed upper ocean circulation.  Comparisons between the response            
              of the two oceans to the same external forcing will be used to                 
              further elucidate mechanisms of tropical climate change.
