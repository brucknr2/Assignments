Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The primary purpose of this doctoral dissertation improvement                  
              award is to explore the relationship between dietary specia                    
              lization and the structure of primate dentition and masticatory                
              musculature.  Understanding the mechanics of mastication is a                  
              central issue of anthropological research for it allows a better               
              appreciation of the relationships of animals to their                          
              environments.  Additionally, such understanding can lead to                    
              clearer interpretations of the fossil record of primate and human              
              evolution; a record which often consists of teeth.                             
                                                                                             
              This study will test the relationships between form and function               
              of primate dentition by measuring bite forces at a variety of                  
              positions along the dental arcade in a number of primate taxa.                 
              Additionally, three-dimensional coordinate data will be collected              
              for numerous primates in order to determine the covariation among              
              biomechanically important dimensions.  Closely related species                 
              which differ in dietary specialization will be tested.  This will              
              allow the testing of hypotheses regarding the relationship of                  
              diet to anatomy.
