Abstract    :
              It is becoming apparent that among the youngest stars, multiple                
              systems are very common.  This suggests that in the process of                 
              collapsing to form stars, molecular clouds fragment.  The collapse             
              process will be modeled using a new three dimensional hydrodynamics            
              code.  A range of possible molecular cloud cores will be studied               
              to determine what parameters favor fragmentation.  The evolution               
              of the fragments will be followed to determine which survive as                
              binary objects.  Finally, the appearance of the models will be                 
              compared with observations of suspected binary protostars.
