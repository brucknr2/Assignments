Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This project asks for support to collect large-diameter, long (>20-            
              30 m) piston cores at selected Blake and Bahama Outer Ridge                    
              intermediate water depth sediment drift sites, and conduct a 3.5               
              Khz survey to tie into existing multi- and  single-channel seismic             
              reflection data.  This work will provide significant new data on               
              the paleoceanography of this mid-latitude region in late Quaternary            
              time, and thus is of timely relevance to Ocean Drilling Program                
              objectives.  Characterization and reconnaissance sampling of drift             
              deposits will allow the recovery of high deposition rate sediments             
              (likely 8-14 cm/kiloyear) that hold the key to analysis and                    
              interpretation of sub-orbital scale global change events.
