Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This Americas Program award will support Dr. Alberto                           
              A. Sagues, of the University of South Florida-Tampa,                           
              in a collaborative research program with Dr. Luis A.                           
              Maldonado and Pedro Castro Borges, of the Merida                               
              Unit of the Center of Research and Advanced Studies                            
              of the National Polytechnic Institute (IPN-                                    
              CINVESTAV), Mexico.  Their work will investigate the                           
              contamination of concrete by chloride ions from                                
              seawater in warm environments, and the effect of                               
              that contamination on organically-coated reinforcing                           
              steel.  The information obtained from this                                     
              cooperative effort will be critical to the                                     
              successful control of corrosion in tropical marine                             
              environments.                                                                  
                                                                                             
              The proposed interaction will benefit both nations                             
              by establishing a common approach toward corrosion                             
              detection and control in a shared geographic region.                           
              By increasing our understanding of steel corrosion                             
              in concrete, this project has the potential to make                            
              a significant contribution towards improving the                               
              durability of structures.
