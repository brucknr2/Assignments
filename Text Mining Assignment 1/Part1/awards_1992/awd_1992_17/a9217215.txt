Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This three-year award supports U.S.-France                                     
              cooperative research in geological sciences among                              
              Paul R. Silver, Carnegie Institution of                                        
              Washington, and David Mainprice and Alain Vauchez                              
              of the Technophysics Laboratory at the University                              
              of Montpellier in France.  The investigators will                              
              make measurement of shear-wave splitting on                                    
              teleseismic shear waves, and use them to study                                 
              the past and present deformation of continents                                 
              during tectonic events, such as orogenies and                                  
              rifting episodes.  The main objective of the                                   
              proposed research is to take measurements on                                   
              upper mantle deformation. In particular, the                                   
              investigators will study the relationship between                              
              mantle deformation and crust in various orogenic                               
              settings.  Measurements and observations will use                              
              data from stations in the Appalachian Mountains,                               
              the Basin and Range Province (western United                                   
              States) and the Pyrenees.                                                      
                                                                                             
              The proposed research requires knowledge in three                              
              distinct disciplines represented by the                                        
              participants. The U.S. investigator brings                                     
              expertise in seismology. This is complemented by                               
              French expertise in petrophysics and structural                                
              geology. Results from the research will advance                                
              our understanding of the evolution of continents                               
              and plate movement and tectonics.
