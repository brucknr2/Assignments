Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This three-year award supports U.S.-France cooperative research                
              in Theoretical Physics between Antal Jevicki of Brown University               
              and Jean Avan of the Laboratory for Theoretical High Energy                    
              Physics, University of Paris VI.  The investigators propose to                 
              solve a series of problems in string theory and quantum gravity.               
              The objectives are to understand the symmetries of two                         
              dimensional string theory and explore its relationship to higher               
              dimensional integrable theories. Specifically the research                     
              involves exotic matrix models, quantum symmetries, interacting                 
              theory of tachyons, topological fields and the nature of w-                    
              infinity algebra, which appears throughout matrix models and                   
              topological fields.                                                            
                                                                                             
              The U.S. investigator brings to this collaboration expertise in                
              theoretical physics.  This is complemented by the French                       
              investigators experience in mathematical physics.  The                         
              investigators have already progressed on some key aspects of                   
              string theory and the nature of w-infinity algebra.  This project              
              will enable them to expand their efforts and ultimately apply                  
              their results to the physics of black holes, early cosmology, and              
              ultra high energy physics.
