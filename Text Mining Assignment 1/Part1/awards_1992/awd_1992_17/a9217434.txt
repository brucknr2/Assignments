Abstract    :
              9217434  Matsudaira  A mass spectrometer will be used primarily by groups 
              involved in protein sequencing and peptide synthesis that  currently use
              outside facilities for mass analysis and by  the mouse genome project for
              developing methods for mapping  DNA fragments. Laser desorption is a far
              superior technique  for detecting, resolving, and determining the mass of a 
              molecule. Ionization of the sample by laser desorption has  many advantages
              over ionization by fast atom bombardment,  plasma desorption, electrospray, or
              thermospray methods. The  Lasermat routinely provides masses in the range 1,000
              -  100,000 from < 1 pmol of proteins and peptides. The accuracy  of the mass
              observed mass is sample dependent but is  generally within 0.1% at a mass of
              30,000. The instrument is  operated through easy-to-use software on a personal
              computer  which controls data collection and analysis. The software  simplifies
              the training of unspecialized researchers in the  operation of the instrument
              and eliminates the need for a  specialist in mass spectrometry to operate the
              instrument  and analyze the spectra.
