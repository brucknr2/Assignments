Abstract    :
              The radiative opacity of stellar material is fundamental to                    
              calculations of stellar structure, evolution and pulsation.  In                
              1985 M.J. Seaton of University College London proposed an                      
              international project which would exploit modern computing capacity            
              to produce an up-to-date set of opacities.  The calculations are               
              now finished and this grant will support setting up a database                 
              system to provide network access to the results.  It                           
              will also have the capability to calculate various physical                    
              quantities from the database to the specifications of the user.
