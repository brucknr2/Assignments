Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Two methods of Arbitrarily Primed Polymerase Chain Reaction                    
              (AP-PCR) for the development of molecular markers for populations              
              and species of marine phytoplankton will be examined.  These are               
              Random Amplified Polymorphic DNA (RAPDtm) and transfer RNA-PCR                 
              (tRNA-PCR).  Preliminary data obtained using the eucaryotic                    
              picoplankter.  Nannochloropsis spp. (Eustigmatophyceae) provide                
              supportive evidence of the utility of these methods.
