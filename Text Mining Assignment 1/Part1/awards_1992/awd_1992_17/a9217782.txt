Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This award will support a cooperative research project between                 
              Professor George Klinzing of the University of Pittsburgh and                  
              Professor Yutaka Tsuji of Osaka University in Japan in the area                
              of basic understanding of pneumatic transport to produce a more                
              realistic model and simulation.  Professor Klinzing will                       
              concentrate on the experiment on particle wall interactions while              
              Professor Tsuji will carry out the modeling and simulation aspect              
              of the research.  Facilities at the Pittsburgh Energy Technology               
              Center, such as the world class laser-sheet motion analyzer, will              
              be utilized in this project.  Through this collaboration, more                 
              realistic simulations and thus efficient study and design of                   
              pneumatic transport systems will be possible.  The investigators               
              will develop the proper model in concert with the experiment                   
              results of the micro-experiments.
