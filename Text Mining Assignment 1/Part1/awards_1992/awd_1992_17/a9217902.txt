Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Astrometric Research in the Southern Hemisphere.                               
                                                                                             
              Dr. Van Altena will continue the second epoch observations of the              
              Southern Proper Motion Program (SPM) and the measurement, analysis,            
              and interpretation of the absolute proper motions that are the                 
              result of the SPM.  A deep probe of the structure of our Galaxy in             
              the direction of the South Galactic Pole (SGP) to very faint                   
              magnitudes will provide needed information on the relative                     
              contributions of the different galactic components to the spatial,             
              kinematic, and metallicity distributions of the stars.  The                    
              development of a detailed interpetive model of the Galaxy to                   
              describe the observed distributions will help to combine the                   
              results of the SPM, the deep SGP study, and the results of other               
              investigations into a coherent picture of the Galaxy.
