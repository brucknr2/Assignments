Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This three-year award supports U.S.-France cooperative research                
              in chemical systems involving Kathleen Stebe of Johns Hopkins                  
              University, Dominique Langevin of the Ecole Normale Superieure                 
              (Paris) and Dominique Barthes-Biesel of Compiegne University of                
              Technology. The investigators will study the effects of                        
              surfactant adsorption on fluid particle motions within the                     
              context of new applications including: (1) the flow of foams in                
              porous media; (2) thermocapillary migration of bubbles and drops               
              in microgravity fluids processing; and (3) kinetic rate constants              
              for adsorption and desorption of surfactant molecules.                         
                                                                                             
              Surfactant adsorption and its effects may be important for                     
              enhanced oil recovery.  The underlying theory is that detergent                
              foams could be used to control the mobility of a displacing fluid              
              in tertiary oil recovery and thereby improve its control for                   
              removing oil from rock pores. The U.S. investigator has extensive              
              experience in both theory and experiments in interfacial                       
              mechanics, specifically focusing on surfactant related                         
              interfacial phenomena.  This is complemented by the French                     
              investigators' expertise in soft matter physics (surfactants and               
              polymers) and two phase flows.  The project will benefit from the              
              Paris group's unique experimental apparatus and light scattering               
              technique for analyzing capillary action at interfaces.  A                     
              related experiment on gas bubbles and surfactant adsorption will               
              be conducted by the group in Compiegne.
