Abstract    :
                   Coherent phase transitions lead to characteristic fine scale              
              structures. Analytic methods based on the minimization of elastic              
              energy have had considerable success, but they also have notable               
              limitations. Numerical methods are an absolute necessity for                   
              exploring local minimizers, for understanding the role of various              
              selection mechanisms, and above all for modelling dynamics. We                 
              will continue the development of a new approach based on                       
              nonconvex elastic energies. Both elastodynamics and                            
              diffusion-driven dynamics will be considered. This work will make              
              use of large-scale computation on both serial and parallel                     
              architectures.
