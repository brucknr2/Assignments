Abstract    :
              9217526  Porter    The objective of this proposal is to carry out a systematic, 
              multitechnique investigation of the nanometer-scale structural and  electronic
              properties films derived from aniline, functionalized  aniline, and aniline
              copolymers.  The study will utilize the  techniques of scanning tunneling
              microscopy (STM), tunneling  spectroscopy (TS), x-ray photoelectron
              spectroscopy (XPS) and  electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR).  STM and TS
              provide local,  nanometer-resolved structural and electronic information on the
               material's surface.  XPS identifies the chemical state of the  polymer films,
              whereas EPR will be used to investigate the  paramagnetic properties of the
              polymers.  The study will begin with  the electrochemically plated and free
              standing films of polymers  derived from aniline, hydroxyaniline, and
              aniline-3-  aminophenylboronic acid.  The primary goal of this research will be
               to gain a fundamental understanding of the influence and interplay  that the
              chemical structure has on the nanometer-scale structure  and morphology.  In
              addition both the chemical and physical  structures will be correlated to the
              observed macroscopic  conduction properties of these materials.    This
              research in an undergraduate, minority institution serving  Native Americans
              will allow the students to participate in  contemporary materials research
              dealing with polymeric synthetic  metals.  ***
