Abstract    :
              This grant is to assist in the support of an international                     
              symposium (The Fifteenth Boundary Element Method International                 
              Conference, BEM 15) on boundary element methods to be held August              
              10 - 12, 1993 at Worcester Polytechnic Institute, Worcester, MA.               
              The aim of the symposium is to appraise the state-of-the-art and               
              set directions for new research in the field of boundary element               
              methods for the year 2000. It will facilitate a dialogue between               
              engineers and scientists working in a variety of technological                 
              fields that employ boundary element methods. The conference will               
              result in an authoritative high quality proceedings volume which               
              will serve as a basic reference on this subject.***   //
