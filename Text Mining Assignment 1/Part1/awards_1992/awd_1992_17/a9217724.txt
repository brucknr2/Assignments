Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The principle investigators will develop and implement a                       
              significantly upgraded and well documented capability for the                  
              acquisition, processing and display of Hydrosweep data on the R/V              
              Ewing.  New shipboard hardware for processing display of swath                 
              bathymetry data will be acquired.  Exiting software will be unified            
              and a user-level documentation will be generated.  The resulting               
              system will be largely independent of the swath mapping system that            
              produced the data, will be easily portable to common workstations              
              and easy for the community to learn.
