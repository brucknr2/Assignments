Abstract    :
              9217707  Lonsdale         This project includes a field program to geophysical
              survey  and geologically sample the two largest transform fault zones on  the
              Pacific-Antarctic plate boundary. The principal objectives are:  (1) to
              understand the structures and tectonics of long, fast-  slipping transform
              faults; (2) to test structural inferences based  largely on remotely sensed
              seismicity and satellite altimetry; (3)  to learn the geologic composition of
              the crustal rocks exposed in  the transforms, and (4) to exploit known outcrops
              of lower  crustal  and upper mantle rocks that the usually inaccessible to
              dredging on  fast-spreading ridges.  ***
