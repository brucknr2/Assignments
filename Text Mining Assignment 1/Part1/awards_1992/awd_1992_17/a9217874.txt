Abstract    :
                   The proposal focuses on alternative constructions of                      
              atomic and molecular eigenfunctions using collective                           
              coordinates.  The main thrust is to identify the best                          
              representations of the molecular complex at small, medium and                  
              large distances and to connect these regions in an optimal                     
              fashion.  The support is entirely for graduate students.
