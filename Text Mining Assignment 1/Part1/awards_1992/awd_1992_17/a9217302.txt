Abstract    :
              9217302  Islam  Systematic quantitative optical  studies of thin films of the
              family  of Ge-Sn-Se-Te glasses will be  made.  The studies will focus on 
              identifying how well these glasses  may be suitable for use as real-  time
              holographic recording media.  ***
