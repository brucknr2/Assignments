Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Funds are provided for a study of Quaternary cores for the Ontong-             
              Java Plateau ODP sites. The approach will be to eliminate the                  
              productivity effect which has a compensating effect on                         
              preservation. This will provide a "corrected" signal for                       
              preservation as a difference between shallow and deep records.                 
              Paleoproductivity signal will be obtained through the study of                 
              benthic formainifera. Ontong-Java is an ideal area for this study              
              as productivity variations as minimal here. The study will                     
              interglacial variations in atmospheric CO2 and on the nature of                
              acoustic reflectors in deep sea carbonates.
