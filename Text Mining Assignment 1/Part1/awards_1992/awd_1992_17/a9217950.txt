Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This proposal addresses one of the most elusive problems in marine             
              bacterial symbiosis research: that of the mode and mechanisms of               
              symbiont inheritance.  Our recent rDNA/rRNA-based hybridization                
              probe studies have demonstrated the efficacy of these techniques in            
              resolving low copies of symbiont target within host tissues.  A                
              trans-ovarial mechanism of symbiont transmission has now been                  
              identified in several species of deep-sea Vesicomyid clams, however            
              the developmental process of symbiont incorporation cannot be                  
              elucidated in these deep-sea representatives.  With initial studies            
              completed we propose to employ a similar suite of molecular tools              
              with several novel additions to examine the ontogenetic and                    
              biochemical process of bacterial symbiont incorporation in the                 
              protobranch bivalve Someya reidi.  Specifically we will: 1)                    
              determine the mode of symbiont transmission and ontogenetic                    
              process of incorporation into the gill tissue, 2)  to may the                  
              metabolic state of the symbionts during the incorporation process              
              and determine the role of the symbionts in the hosts early                     
              development using quantitative fluorescence microscopy, and 3) to              
              examine the symbiont role in environmental cue detection and the               
              process of settlement by monitoring the expression of key metabolic            
              enzymes in the symbionts.
