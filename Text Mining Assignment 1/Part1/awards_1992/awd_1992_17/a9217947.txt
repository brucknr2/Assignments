Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This award supports a U.S.-Japan Seminar on Nonlinear Probnlems                
              in Geometry and Physics.  The co-organizers are Professor Joel                 
              Spruck of the Johns Hopkins University and Professor Hiroshi                   
              Matano of the University of Tokyo.  The seminar will be held at                
              the conclusion of a two-year collaborative research project                    
              between the two principal investigators, which will be undertaken              
              at Johns Hopkins University during 1993 and 1994.                              
                                                                                             
              The research program will focus on nonlinear evolution and free                
              boundary problems arising in Differential Geometry (Mean                       
              Curvature Flow, Anisotropic Crystal Growth, Ricci Flow) and in                 
              the physical theories of phase transitions and interfacial                     
              dynamics (Ginsburg-Landau theory, Allan-Cahn equation, Stefan                  
              problem, Hele-Shaw flow, reaction diffusion equations and pattern              
              formation).  The primary focus will be interdisciplinary research              
              participation in an active research and training seminar.  The                 
              week-long seminar in spring 1994 will be open to the mathematical              
              community, bringing together the leading experts from Japan and                
              the United States to report on the major developments in these                 
              topics.
