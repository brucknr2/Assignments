Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This award will provide funding for U.S. ocean scientists,                     
              especially those in the academic research community, to participate            
              in activities of the International Council for the Exploration of              
              the Sea (ICES) which are of special interest to this community, to             
              the National Science Foundation and other Federal agencies, and to             
              ICES as well.  Under this award U.S. academic research scientists              
              will participate in selected ICES activities which are likely to               
              include the annual ICES Statutory Meeting; meetings of ICES Working            
              Groups; and scientific workshops and planning meetings.
