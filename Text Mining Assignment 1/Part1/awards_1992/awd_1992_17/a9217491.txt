Abstract    :
              Radioanalytic imaging needs of researchers at the University                   
              of Massachusetts Medical Center have overwhelmed the limited                   
              capabilities of the Betascope blot analyzer and our                            
              scintillation counters.  Researchers now require                               
              substantially more capacity for obtaining high resolution,                     
              quantitative analyses of radioanalytic data than is                            
              available with existing facilities.  The PhosphorImager                        
              facility requested in this proposal includes a laser                           
              scanner, high efficiency, high resolution storage phosphor                     
              screens, an image analysis work station, optical drive back                    
              up system, and a grey scale printer.  We anticipate that                       
              this facility will expand our capacity for radioanalysis a                     
              minimum of four to six fold to meet current and future                         
              needs.  In addition to increasing the speed and efficiency                     
              of standard analyses, this unique storage phosphor system                      
              will allow us to convert qualitative assays to quantitative                    
              assays and will also permit us to carry out novel                              
              experiments requiring sensitive, high resolution analyses of                   
              large areas that are impossible with existing facilities.
