Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              A field program to collect piston and gravity cores form N.                    
              Atlantic to ascertain the source of material in "Heinrichs" layers             
              and to search for climatic events recorded in ice cores.  Heinrich             
              layers are devoid of foraminaferal shells and contain different                
              ice-rafted debris than underlying glacial sediments.  Is this PIs              
              will use color variations to identify millennia duration events                
              back to isotopic stage 5 at Site 609.  Fresh cores will be obtained            
              in high sedimentation rate areas in sediment drifts.  AMS dating               
              will provide chronology.
