Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This award will support the travel of U.S. advanced graduate                   
              students and postdoctoral researchers to a U.S.-Sweden workshop                
              to be held in conjunction with a special year (1993) in                        
              mathematical physics at the Mittlag-Leffler Institute, Djursholm,              
              Sweden. The workshop will concentrate on three main topics in                  
              mathematical physics:  quantum mechanical many-body problem;                   
              problems arising in solid state physics; and asymptotic methods.               
              Peter D. Hislop of the University of Kentucky and Anders Melin of              
              the Lund Institute of Technology in Sweden will jointly organize               
              the workshop seminars.  The young American researchers will be                 
              able to attend the workshop for a period of two months each and                
              will be joined by a cohort of Swedish advanced graduate students               
              and postdoctoral researchers.  Prominent American, Swedish and                 
              European mathematicians, who have contributed significantly to the             
              field, will participate in the workshop seminars, thereby providing            
              a unique opportunity for young researchers to advance their                    
              understanding of current research themes and develop their                     
              research and future collaborations.
