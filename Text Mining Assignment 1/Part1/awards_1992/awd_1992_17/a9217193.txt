Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                                                                                            
              This research is a new and detailed approach to the investigation              
              of chemical scavenging processes in the Atlantic and Pacific                   
              Oceans, using the distributions of the rare earth elements (REE) as            
              indicators of particulate removal and redox cycling under varying              
              conditions of primary particle flux and water column structure.  In            
              situ pumping, will be used to collect large suspended particulate              
              samples as part of an ongoing study of dissolved/particulate                   
              fractionation for a suite of major and minor elements.  Established            
              trace metal seawater sampling techniques will be used to collect               
              REE water samples.  The dependence of dissolved and particulate REE            
              patterns and cerium anomalies on the mass concentration,                       
              composition, and vertical flux of the suspended particle field will            
              be explored.  This will be accomplished by profile measurements at             
              four oceanographically distinct sites: 1) the productive Northeast             
              Pacific margin environment, 2) the oligotrophic Northeast Atlantic,            
              3) the Gulf Stream/NW Sargasso Sea frontal system, and 4) the                  
              variably productive Central Equatorial Pacific.  The REE will be               
              used as probes of scavenging processes over spatial and temporal               
              gradients in primary and new production.  Results will have broad              
              implications for the critical variables which regulate biological              
              uptake, adsorptive scavenging, and redox-controlled removal of                 
              trace inorganics in open ocean and ocean margin environments.
