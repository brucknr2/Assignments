Abstract    :
              A reanalysis of the extensive helioseismic data set from Big Bear              
              Solar Observatory will be undertaken to extract all the information            
              which it contains.  A search will also be made for variation of the            
              solar oscillations with the solar cycle since the data covers the              
              entire interval from solar minimum to maximum.  New precise radial             
              velocity data will be obtained for bright solar type stars to                  
              attempt to detect individual p-mode oscillations analogous to those            
              in the sun.
