Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This research will use the Green Bank 4.85 GHZ northern sky                    
              survey to find radio identification candidates for extragalactic               
              sources in the Infrared Astronomy Satellite (IRAS) Faint Source                
              Catalog.  The candidate identifications will be checked using VLA              
              maps and optical positions.  It is expected that this work will                
              yield approximately 200 confirmed radio identifications having                 
              active galactic nuclei as their source, and another 200 sources                
              powered by stars in normal spirals and starburst galaxies.                     
                                                                                             
              The Principal Investigator is a widely recognized expert in                    
              identification of radio sources.
