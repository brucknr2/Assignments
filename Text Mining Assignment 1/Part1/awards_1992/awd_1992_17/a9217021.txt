Abstract    :
              In this project, the PI's will continue analysis of data and                   
              publication of results from a winter-time field study, conducted               
              from October, 1991 to April, 1992, of the Columbia River plume                 
              over the Oregon/Washington continental shelf.  A broad array of                
              data collected under a variety of environmental conditions                     
              include:  moored measurements of water velocity, temperature,                  
              conductivity (density), bottom pressure, and wind;  Lagrangian                 
              drifter currents;  satellite imagery;  and coastal wind, sea                   
              level, and surface waves.  Extensive further analysis of a                     
              variety of mechanisms by which the plume is driven into the                    
              coastal ocean and mixes away will be carried out, and the results              
              published.
