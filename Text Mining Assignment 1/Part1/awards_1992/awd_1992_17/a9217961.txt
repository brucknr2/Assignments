Abstract    :
              The effective temperatures, surface gravities, luminosities and                
              masses of white dwarfs and stars which are approaching the white               
              dwarf stage of evolution will be measured.  These parameters will              
              permit tests of the interior structure of white dwarfs, allow                  
              better interpretation of x-ray and ultraviolet observations of                 
              these stars and test our understanding of physical processes in                
              these stars.  Similar observations of hot subdwarfs will yield                 
              space densities for such stars.  Faint, red main sequence stars                
              will be observed to obtain basic parameters and determine the lower            
              mass limit for stars.  Chromospheric activity and the dynamical                
              properties of the lowest mass stars will also be analyzed.
