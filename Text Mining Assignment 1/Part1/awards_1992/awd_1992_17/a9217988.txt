Abstract    :
              Because white dwarfs cool and fade very slowly, some of the oldest             
              stars in the galaxy can still be observed.  Such objects can be                
              used to determine the age of the galactic disk and perhaps the                 
              halo.   However, this depends on the physical laws which are used              
              to calculate the cooling times.  A new set of models with improved             
              input physics will be constructed and applied to determine the star            
              formation history of the local disk population.  These models will             
              also find application in the analysis of the period spectrum of                
              white dwarfs.
