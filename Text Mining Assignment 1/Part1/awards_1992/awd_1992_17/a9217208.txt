Abstract    :
                   The proposed research has two goals.  Its scientific goal is              
              to understand the structure of human handwriting.  Its engineering             
              goal is to advance the state-of-the-art in handwriting recognition             
              technology.  To accomplish both goals, the characterization of                 
              statistical constraints in unconstrained handwriting is proposed.              
              To be investigated are physical constraints on handwriting (arising            
              from the structure and limits of human anatomy and motor control),             
              motor-perceptual constraints on handwriting (such as executability             
              and legibility), and constraints due to the ad-hoc conventions of              
              handwriting (such as those arising from the Roman alphabet and                 
              chosen language).
