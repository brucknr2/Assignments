Abstract    :
              A phosphorimager system will be purchased for the Department                   
              of Biology at Texas A&M University that will allow detection                   
              and quantitation of alpha-, beta-, gamma- and x-rays.                          
              Research programs directly benefitting from acquisition of                     
              the phosphorimaging system include studies of                                  
              photosynthesis, recombination, replication, circadian                          
              rhythms, protein transport, growth and differentiation,                        
              development, proteinases, immunology, signal transduction                      
              and gene expression.  The instrument will be located in the                    
              Advanced DNA Technologies Laboratory, which will be                            
              responsible for training, technical support, maximization of                   
              use, and maintenance of the phosphorimaging system.
