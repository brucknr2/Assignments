Abstract    :
                   The goal of this project is to bring together researchers from            
              a number of disciplines to focus on the current state of research              
              and new research directions in manufacturing for the last decade               
              of the twentieth century.                                                      
                   This is the second conference in a series of two.  The first              
              was held in Gaithersburg, Maryland during the summer of 1991.  This            
              conference, as was the first, is sponsored by the Operations                   
              Research Society of America, the German Operations Research                    
              Society, the National Institute of Standards and Technology, and               
              with additional support from the National Science Foundation.  This            
              is an important opportunity to link theory and practice in                     
              manufacturing.
