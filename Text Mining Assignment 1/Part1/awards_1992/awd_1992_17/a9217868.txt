Abstract    :
                   This award supports the cross-disciplinary efforts and the                
              development of a research collaboration involving quantitative                 
              modelling in the geosciences.  In particular the mathematician(s)              
              and the GEO scientist research will focus their attention on the               
              statistical and scientific analysis of records arising from ice                
              cores taken from the Greenland ice sheet.  The two-phase                       
              interdisciplinary research will begin with the development of                  
              scientifically and statistically valid exploratory and                         
              confirmatory statistical techniques for assessing the record of                
              the paleoclimate as recorded in the Greenland ice sheet.  The                  
              second phase will address the development of mathematical models               
              relating the environmental signals deposited in polar ice sheets               
              to important paleoclimate factors.  This project presents                      
              significant mathematical and statistical challenges to provide                 
              geoscientists with tools to be applied to the task of                          
              understanding the approximately 200,000 years od Earth's climatic              
              history.
