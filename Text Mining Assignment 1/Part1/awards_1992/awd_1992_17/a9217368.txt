Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The Grand Challenge Application Groups competition provides one                
              mechanism for the support of multidisciplinary teams of scientists             
              and engineers to meet the goals of the High Performance Computing              
              and Communications (HPCC) Initiative in Fiscal Year 1992.  The                 
              ideal proposal provided not only excellence in science: focussed               
              problem with potential for substantial impact in a critical area of            
              science and engineering but also significant interactions between              
              scientific and computational scientist, that would have impact in              
              high-performance computational activity beyond the specific                    
              scientific or engineering problem area(s) or discipline being                  
              studied.                                                                       
                                                                                             
              The methodology of quantum chemistry, molecular dynamics, and solid            
              state theory should, in principle, allow predictions of the                    
              physical, chemical and electronic properties of materials.  This               
              project will focus on bridging the gap between current                         
              methodologies for atomic-level simulations of simulations and the              
              level required for accurately describing the important properties              
              of real materials.                                                             
                                                                                             
              Methodologies that will be explored for the high capacity atomic               
              level simulations, with implementations on parallel computers,                 
              include: the Cell Multipol (CMM); Hessian-Based Singular Valued                
              Decomposition (HB/SVD); and the Pseudospectral Generalized valence             
              Bond(PS-GVB) method.
