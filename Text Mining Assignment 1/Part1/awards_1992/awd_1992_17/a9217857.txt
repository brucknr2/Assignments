Abstract    :
              This is a Presidential Young Investigator award.  The research                 
              will include continued development of instrumentation and testing              
              devices in the area of geotechnical engineering, as well as                    
              expansion of involvement in hazardous waste engineering.  Current              
              research dealing with the development of ultrasonic crack                      
              detection for a new in situ stress measurement system will                     
              continue.                                                                      
                                                                                             
              Work in the hazardous waste area will diverge into two areas.                  
              First, development of a cone penetration device (Envirocone) that              
              allows ground water and vadose zone sampling, and second, a                    
              combined program with several biologists yielding several                      
              projects; including a biosensor for the Envirocone to detect                   
              trace carcinogens, a laboratory model to study biocontamination                
              of geotextiles, and a potential technique to electro-osmotically               
              move bacteria through soil.
