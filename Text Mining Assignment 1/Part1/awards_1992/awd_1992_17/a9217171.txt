Abstract    :
                   In recent years there has been a renewed interest in                      
              the problem of unraveling the various possible causes of                       
              allocyclic variability in alluvial basin fills (e.g.                           
              tectonics, climate, subsidence, eustasy).  One approach to                     
              this problem has been the development of quantitative,                         
              physically based models for the filling of sedimentary                         
              basins, but these models have already evolved well beyond                      
              the data available to test and refine them.  There is a                        
              continuing need for new high-resolution data sets that can                     
              be used to evaluate the basic predictions of these models.                     
              The main goal of this project is to produce such a data set                    
              from the superbly exposed Tertiary alluvial systems of the                     
              SE margin of the Ebro Basin, Spain.   PI's will collect                        
              closely spaced paleomagnetic sections and measurements of                      
              gravel distribution and channel characteristics in three                       
              dimensions, in at least two adjoining alluvial fans of                         
              different sizes.  These data, together with ongoing modeling                   
              efforts, by the PI's will provide insight on how various                       
              causes of allocyclic progradation can be distinguished and                     
              in particular on the identification of true "syntectonic"                      
              conglomerates.
