Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This award supports a two-year collaborative research project                  
              between Professor Melvin Okamura of the University of California,              
              San Diego and Professor Teizo Kitagawa of the Institute for                    
              Molecular Science, Okazaki National Research Institutes, Japan.                
              The study involves the use of resonance Raman spectroscopy to study            
              the structure and dynamics of quinones in the bacterial reaction               
              center, a protein that is involved in the primary electron and                 
              proton transfer processes in photosynthesis.  The project combines             
              the extensive experience on reaction centers of Professor Okamura's            
              group with the expertise in resonance Raman spectroscopy of the                
              Okazaki group.  The results should lead to new information about               
              the mechanism of solar energy conversion.
