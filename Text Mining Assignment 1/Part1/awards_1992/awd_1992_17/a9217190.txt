Abstract    :
              A cooperative program combining experimental ionospheric                       
              observations with mathematical theory and modeling is proposed                 
              involving the Atmospheric Sciences research group at the MIT                   
              Haystack Observatory and Russian scientists at Moscow State                    
              University and the Polar Geophysical Institute in Murmansk.  The               
              Russian participants have developed the theoretical methods and                
              radio receiving equipment for phase-difference ionospheric                     
              tomography and have performed preliminary experiments in Russia                
              which have provided an initial verification of these techniques.               
              In order to calibrate the resolution and accuracy of the method,               
              however, experiments done in conjunction with simultaneous direct              
              ionospheric observations are needed.  A cooperative research                   
              program between scientists and engineers in the US and Russia is               
              proposed to carry out a series of tomographic experiments in 1993              
              along the N-S meridian through Millstone Hill, Massachusetts.  In              
              conjunction with direct ionospheric observations made by the US                
              participants with the Millstone Hill incoherent scatter radar, an              
              array of Russian-built ground-base satellite receivers will be                 
              deployed to investigate ionospheric structure using tomographic                
              techniques.  The joint research will serve to both calibrate and               
              improve the tomographic deconvolution using the phase-difference               
              technique and will address the ability of radio tomography to image            
              small-scale ionospheric structures, beyond the resolution                      
              capability of the radar.
