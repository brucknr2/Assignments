Abstract    :
                    The literature on marine benthic ecology and evolution  has              
              generally  ignored fertilization rates as an important factor  in              
              the  life  histories of benthic species, many which are important              
              resource species.  These rates have implicitly been assumed to be              
              uniformly high and thus not a terribly significant factor in  the              
              establishment of the adult populations.  There are now  a  number              
              of  data  sets  which  raise doubts about the  validity  of  that              
              assumption.  The  research will determine rates of  fertilization              
              among  natural populations and will explore some of  the  factors              
              controlling these rates in reef communities.                                   
                   Using the Caribbean gorgonian, Plexaura A, as a model system              
              Drs. Lasker and Coffroth will determine rates of fertilization of              
              eggs  released  in synchronous spawning events.   Plexaura  A  is              
              clonal and often has skewed ratios of male and female colonies on              
              different reefs.  This will enable comparison of rates from reefs              
              which  differ  in  current regime and  in  the  density  of  male              
              colonies.  Using  random amplified polymorphic  DNA  (RAPD)  from              
              individual planulae larvae, they will conduct paternity analyses,              
              determine  the  proportion  of  fertilizations  attributable   to              
              specific male clones, and determine the effects of clone size and              
              distribution on fertilization.  If rates are low and are affected              
              by  factors such as population density, then it will be necessary              
              to   incorporate  fertilization  rates  in  analyses  of  benthic              
              population animal dynamics and evolution.
