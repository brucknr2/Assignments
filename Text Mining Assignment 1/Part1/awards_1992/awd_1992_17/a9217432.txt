Abstract    :
              9217432  Young    This award will support collaborative research  between Michal
              Young, Purdue University, and Mauro  Pezze, Politechnico di Milano, Italy.  The
              project  will investigate integration of multiple operational  models of
              concurrent software.    Research issues for the project include methods for 
              reasoning about the relation between different  behavioral models of the same
              component; techniques  for analyzing the behavior of systems in which 
              components may be modeled in different ways;  automatic generation of
              state-space analysis tools  with support for multi-formalism analysis; and 
              models of time amenable to practical state-space  analysis.  The Italian
              investigator will contribute  expertise in Petri net models of concurrent
              systems.   The US investigator will bring expertise in the  analysis of
              concurrent software and the integration  of analysis techniques and tools in
              software  development environments.  Pezze will take the lead  in the more
              theoretical side of the work, and Young  will lead in the design and evaluation
              of the  analysis tool generator.  ***
