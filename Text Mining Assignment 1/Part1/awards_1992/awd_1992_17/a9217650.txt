Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This awards supports a two-year collaborative research project                 
              between Professor Ken-Ichi Nishikawa of the University of Iowa                 
              and Professor Jun-ichi Sakai of Toyama University, Japan.  Also                
              involved in the project are Professor Torsten Neubert of the                   
              University of Michigan and Shinji Koide of Toyama University.                  
                                                                                             
              Recently the Japan-U.S. satellite "Yohkoh" has obtained new                    
              observations of solar flare plasmas.  In particular, the                       
              coalescences of current loops have been observed in the active                 
              regions on the Sun, which were proposed by Sakai et al since                   
              1982.  This observation has pointed out the importance of their                
              idea that the solar flare is generated by the coaslescence of                  
              current loops.  This research project will model the dynamics of               
              the coalescence of current loops by means of a 3-D                             
              electromagnetic (E-M) particle simulation code associated with                 
              theories and MHD simulations.  The main topic is to investigate                
              the kinetic processes such as energy transfer, acceleration of                 
              high-energy particles, and electromagnetic emissions associated                
              with the current loop coalescence that cannot be studied by MHD                
              simulations.
