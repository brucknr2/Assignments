Abstract    :
              This award from the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program,                  
              provides partial support for a new Gordon Research Conference                  
              entitled "Chemical Reactions at Surfaces".  This conference                    
              brings together researchers from chemistry, physics,                           
              engineering, and materials science to discuss advances in the                  
              microscopic understanding of chemical reactions occurring on                   
              solid surfaces.  The funding provided will be used to support                  
              the participation of ten advanced graduate students in this                    
              Gordon Research Conference.

              This award will support the participation of ten advanced                      
              graduate students in a newly established Gordon Conference on                  
              the chemistry of reactions at solid surfaces.  The first                       
              conference will be held in March 1993 in Ventura, California.
