Abstract    :
                   This project consists of an investigation of the inverse                  
              scattering problems for the multidimensional Schrodinger                       
              equations when the potential is independent of energy and when                 
              the potential is proportional to energy.  In the former case, the              
              Wiener-Hopf factorization and the generalized Muskhelishvili-                  
              Vekua technique will be used to investigate the characterization               
              of the scattering data, the relationship between bound states and              
              partial indices, the inversion from partial data, and the                      
              stability of the inversion.  In the latter case, the inverse                   
              scattering problem will be formulated as a Riemann-Hilbert                     
              problem with a discontinuity of almost periodic type and its                   
              solution will be obtained through a generalized Wiener-Hopf                    
              factorization technique.                                                       
                   The solution of the inverse scattering problem with energy-               
              independent potentials is equivalent to determining molecular,                 
              atomic, and nuclear forces in terms of the scattering data                     
              obtained in collision experiments, and the determination of these              
              forces is one of the fundamental problems in physics.  The                     
              inverse scattering problem with energy-dependent potentials is                 
              equivalent to the determination of the properties of a medium                  
              using only the measurements made on the boundary; such a problem               
              has many important applications in wave propagation, seismology,               
              nondestructive testing, oil exploration, atmospheric profile                   
              inversion, and other areas.
