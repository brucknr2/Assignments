Abstract    :
                   The number of detection techniques for the hydroxyl radical               
              has blossomed within the last few years.  In addition to long-path             
              absorption and chemical conversion are the improved in situ,                   
              spectroscopic fluorescence methods.  Such methods can have both the            
              sensitivity and specificity that is required for versatile                     
              measurements from either remote ground-based sites or from                     
              aircraft.                                                                      
                   They have for the last two years pursued the measurement                  
              technique for detection of tropospheric OH and HO2 by laser induced            
              fluorescence in chambers at low pressures.  This technique is now              
              sufficiently well developed that an instrument can be built which              
              can be used either from remote platforms or from aircraft.  This               
              award will support the building of this instrument and allow a                 
              series of ground-based field measurements and intercomparisons.                
              This instrument will be designed so that it can be mounted in a                
              double rack on an aircraft.  Actual use on an aircraft will require            
              only the design and construction of an air intake duct and slight              
              changes to the orientation of the air inlet.
