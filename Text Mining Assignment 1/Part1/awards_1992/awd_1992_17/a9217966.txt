Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The project will link the record of Plio-Pleistocene magnetic                  
              reversals to lithologic variations in sediment cores from the North            
              Atlantic, Equatorial Atlantic and western tropical Pacific, using              
              continuous records of sediment porosity, magnetic susceptibility,              
              and optical density.  Results will address three problems: (1) the             
              nature of short-term magnetic events reported elsewhere; (2) the               
              depth at which magnetic grain orientation becomes established; (3)             
              the relative accuracy and precision of the previously-established              
              age scale for magnetic reversals based on K-Ar dating versus more              
              recent approaches based on "tuning" lithologic variations to                   
              orbital forcing.
