Abstract    :
              The objective of the proposed research is to use numerical                     
              models of crystallization processes to further understand                      
              the origins of layering in igneous rocks.  The emphasis is                     
              on a post-nucleation process termed crystal aging (Ostwald                     
              ripening) that can give rise to fine-scale layering as a                       
              result of rhythmic long-range order related to dissolution                     
              of small crystals and growth of larger crystals.  The                          
              results of this research should increase understanding of                      
              the petrogenesis and origin of layered mafic and ultramafic                    
              intrusions, which are the major source of the platinum group                   
              elements.
