Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                                                                                             
                                                                                            
              This work is to improve our understanding of the role of marine                
              snow in the (oligotrophic) North Pacific Central Gyre where data               
              regarding such questions is especially lacking.  Souba samplings of            
              seawater at station ALOHA will be evaluated from the perspective of            
              the aggregation process itself: marine snow composition, abundance,            
              size and structure.  Macro-aggregation rates and marine snow                   
              residence times will be independently estimated using 234Th:238U               
              disequilibria techniques.  Analysis of data will be constrained by             
              high quality biological, chemical and physical water column data.
