Abstract    :
              This U.S.-Brazil Cooperative Science Program                                   
              award will support collaboration by Richard                                    
              Hanlin of the University of Georgia and Maria                                  
              Menezes of the Universidade Federal Rural de                                   
              Pernambuco in Brazil.  The project aims to                                     
              collect, identify, and prepare illustrated                                     
              descriptions of Brazilian ascomycetes.                                         
                                                                                             
              Ascomycetes comprise a major component of                                      
              fungal flora in the tropics.  Many species grow                                
              parasitically on plants; some cause diseases                                   
              that imperil crops.  They are often poorly                                     
              identified and understood.  The rapid loss of                                  
              native tropical flora makes it important to                                    
              learn as much about endemic fungi as possible                                  
              before more species are destroyed.  The                                        
              researchers, accompanied by two graduate                                       
              students working under Hanlin, will focus on                                   
              plant pathogenic species, but will collect                                     
              species from other substrates.  They will                                      
              verify identification by comparison with type                                  
              material.  Also, they will try to grow species                                 
              collected in pure culture and study possible                                   
              anamorphs.  U.S. and Brazilian students and                                    
              technicians will learn methods for working with                                
              ascomycetes.  A book, Illustrated Genera of                                    
              Ascomycetes, will be published in Portuguese.                                  
              Both the U.S. and Brazilian sides will benefit                                 
              from the training of junior participants and                                   
              expansion of the knowledge base on endangered                                  
              ascomycetes in the tropics.
