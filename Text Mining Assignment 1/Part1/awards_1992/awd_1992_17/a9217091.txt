Abstract    :
                   The Grand Challenge Application Groups competition provides               
              one mechanism for the support of multidiscipinary teams of                     
              scientists and engineers to meet the goals of the High Performance             
              Computing and Communications (HPCC) Initiative in Fiscal Year 1992.            
              The ideal proposal provided not only excellence in science:                    
              focussed problem with potential for substantial impact in a                    
              critical area of science and engineering) but also significant                 
              interactions between scientific and computational activities,                  
              usually involving mathematical, computer or computational                      
              scientists, that would have impact in high-performance                         
              computational activity beyond the specific scientific or                       
              engineering problem area(s) or discipline being studied.    This is            
              a project to research and develop an Automated Interactive                     
              Microscope (AIM).  The AIM will combine the latest technologies in             
              light microscopy and reagent chemistry with advanced techniques for            
              computerized image processing, image analysis, and display,                    
              implemented on high-performance parallel computers.  This                      
              combination will produce an automated, high-speed, interactive tool            
              that will make possible new kinds of basic biological research on              
              living cells and tissues.  While one milestone of the research will            
              be to show the proof-of-concept of AIM, the on-going thrust will be            
              continued development as new technologies arise and the involvement            
              of the biological community.
