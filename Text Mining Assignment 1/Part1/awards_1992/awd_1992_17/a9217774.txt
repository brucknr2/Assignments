Abstract    :
              This award is made in the Advanced Materials and Processing                    
              Initiative and is supported by both the Chemistry and Materials                
              Research Divisions. Several computer simulation techniques will                
              be applied to study the formation and properties of thin                       
              metallic films.  The simulations closely mimic the laboratory                  
              formation of both amorphous and ordered thin films by atom                     
              deposition.  Solid-liquid and solid-solid interfaces in                        
              metallic systems will be simulated separately to gain a better                 
              understanding of stability and elastic properties of thin                      
              films.  The atomic interactions are described by the Embedded                  
              Atom Method-type interaction potentials that will reproduce                    
              data from a wide range of condensed phase experiments. A                       
              systematic analysis of the microscopic structure will be used                  
              to characterize short-range order in amorphous films, defects                  
              in ordered films, the effect of controllable parameters on film                
              morphology, and the decay of structural correlations at                        
              interfaces. The microscopic models generated in the simulations                
              will be used to study two-level systems, vibrational modes and                 
              elastic properties of the films. Comparison will be made with                  
              experimental data on (1) two-level systems and vibrational                     
              modes in amorphous copper-zirconium films and, (2)                             
              layer-by-layer growth of platinum films at low temperature.

              Computer simulations of metallic film growth, surface                          
              morphology and surface-liquid interfaces will clarify the                      
              results of specific experiments and in some cases will provide                 
              insights into microscopic events not directly amenable to                      
              experiment.
