Abstract    :
              The proposal involves the acquisition of a videomicroscopy                     
              and image         analysis system for a group of                               
              neurobiolgists and cell biologists whose work                                  
              focuses on neuronal development and cell adhesion and                          
              motility. The components to be acquired were chosen to                         
              function together in different flexible combinations to                        
              serve the varied needs of the individual research projects.                    
              The capabilities include: 1) low light level observation and                   
              time lapse analysis of growth and plasticity of living cells                   
              using phase contrast, DIC or fluorescent staining, 2)                          
              calcium mapping in live neurons and growth cones using the                     
              fura-2 fluorescence        ratio image method including                        
              representation in pseudo color images, 3) recombining of                       
              images of objects present in more than one section (in                         
              sectioned material) or optical plane of focus (in whole                        
              mounts) and generating single clear images of entire 3-D                       
              structures, 4) superimposition of images of double (or                         
              triple)         fluorescent staining, obtained at different                    
              wavelengths, in order to better         compare the                            
              colocalization of immunostaining in cellular structures, 5)                    
              contrast         enhancement and subtraction of background                     
              mottle to permit DIC-video images  in real-time, 6)                            
              provisions for mass storage, retrieval and printing of the                     
              images         and the production of short time-lapse                          
              videotapes for demonstrations and seminars.
