                          INT 9217997 Tu  This award supports a two year continuing grant
              under the NSF CGP (Center for Global Partnership) Science Fellowship Program
              for Professor Charles W. Tu, Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering,
              University of California, San Diego.  During two three month visits to Japan in
              1993 and 1994, Professor Tu will work with Dr. Yunosuke Makita, Optoelectronics
              Division, Electrotechnical Laboratory (ETL), The Agency of Industrial Science
              and Technology, MITI, located in Tsukuba Science City.  The focus of this
              project will be in growing Inx Ga1 xAs by molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) with in
              situ carbon ion implantation for a wide range of composition x on GaAs and InP
              substrates.  Carbon doped Inx Ga1 xAs is important as a base layer in
              hererojunction bipolar transistors (HBT) because carbon has a much lower
              diffusivity than other commonly used p type dopants, making a thin base with
              extremely high doping concentration possible for high performance HBT's. 
              Carbon ion implantation may be an effective method of introducing active carbon
              dopants into the films, as compared to some of the other techniques.  The
              combined ion beam MBE system at ETL offers a unique opportunity to investigate
              this scientifically interesting and technologically important materials
              problem.  Extensive charactrization, including structural, electrical, and
              optical measurements and some device fabrication, will be performed both at ETL
              and at the Un iversity of California, San Diego.
