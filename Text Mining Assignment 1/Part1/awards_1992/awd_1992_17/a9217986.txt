Abstract    :
                   This award provides one-half the funds required to purchase               
              equipment that will be installed and operated in the Department of             
              Geological Sciences at the University of Michigan. The University              
              is committed to providing the remainder of the necessary funds.                
                   The equipment consists of a cryogenic superconducting rock                
              magnetometer, a fluxgate magnetometer, and a thermal demagnitizer              
              system. The Principal Investigator, faculty colleagues, and                    
              graduate student co-workers at the University of Michigan are                  
              engaged in research on the geological interpretation, as well as               
              the fundamental causes, of rock magnetism. This equipment will                 
              replace 17-year old equipment central to the measurement needs of              
              their research.
