Abstract    :
              This award supports an investigation of Cretaceous and Tertiary                
              decapod crustaceans (crabs and lobsters) from southern South                   
              America and a comparison of these fossils to similar faunas from               
              Seymour Island, Antarctica.  In late Cretaceous to early Cenozoic              
              time, South America, Australia, New Zealand, and Antarctica                    
              formed a contiguous landmass in the southern Circum-Pacific                    
              region and so dispersal of faunas was presumably unimpeded.  Work              
              in these regions so far suggests that the southern high latitude               
              region played an important role in the evolution and dispersal of              
              new species.  However, details of evolutionary centers and                     
              dispersal patterns remain tentative, in part because of                        
              insufficient field studies in the Antarctic Peninsula and                      
              southern South America.  This work will alleviate part of the                  
              geographical gap in knowledge by collecting and describing                     
              decapod crustaceans from known Cretaceous-Tertiary stratigraphic               
              sections in southern Chile and Argentina.  Comparison of decapods              
              from southern South America with those known from Australia, New               
              Zealand, and the Antarctic Peninsula is an essential part of a                 
              paleoecological model of the entire southern hemisphere.  In                   
              addition, this work will help to define the paleogeographic                    
              context for the unique Cretaceous-Tertiary fossils assemblages                 
              that have recently been described from Seymour Island,                         
              Antarctica.
