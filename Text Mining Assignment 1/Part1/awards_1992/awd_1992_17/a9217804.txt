Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              A combined experimental and modeling approach will be utilized                 
              in an investigation of sediment transport and flow                             
              characteristics over topographically uniform and nonuniform                    
              bed forms. Three areas will be addressed: bedform mechanics,                   
              bedload transport, and suspended load transport. The                           
              theoretical aspects involve development of a model which                       
              includes the coupling of flow and erosion of the sediment bed.                 
              A novel feature is the utilization of a moving belt to hold a                  
              migrating dune in place for experimental observations.                         
                                                                                             
              Predictions of sediment transport by ocean currents and in                     
              rivers is still unreliable and based on empiricism from                        
              limited data; this investigation will adavance understanding                   
              and predictive capabilities.
