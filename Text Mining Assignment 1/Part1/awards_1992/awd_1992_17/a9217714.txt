Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                                                                                             
                                                                                            
              The hydrothermal vent/seawater mixing zone is truly one of the most            
              intense interfaces on Earth.  A whole series of reactions alter the            
              incipient hydrothermal flux and regulate the net transfer of                   
              elements from metal-rich vent solutions to seawater.  Some metal               
              precipitate while others escape in dissolve form.  Some metals                 
              precipitates scavenge trace metals from seawater and other                     
              partially redissolve.  However, within this conceptual framework,              
              the complex interactions and net effects of hydrothermal processes             
              on the concentrations of trace metals in seawater are just                     
              beginning to be pieced together.  This effort will carry out an                
              integrated program on trace metals in hydrothermal systems during              
              the next three years.  The research will include analyses of                   
              samples already on hand as well as new field and experimental work             
              to be coordinated with several independently-funded researchers in             
              the following areas:  (1) Vent Fluid and Plume Processes, (2)                  
              Preservation of Hydrothermal Precipitates, and (3) Implications for            
              Geochemical Cycles.  The investigation will focus on trace metals              
              that have values for the ?(M/Fe)plume particles/(M/Fe)vent fluid!              
              ratio >10 or <0.1 (excluding Mn) and/or some of the metals as yet              
              univestigated in vent fluids/plumes for which preliminary data is              
              very promising including Ga, Bi, Sb, Co, Ni and Tl.
