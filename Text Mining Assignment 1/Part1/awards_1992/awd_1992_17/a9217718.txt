Abstract    :
              This proposal is a request for ancillary equipment that is  essential for the
              optimal operation of two tandem mass  spectrometers used for carbohydrate
              research.  Modern  research grade MS and MS-MS instruments are all designed to 
              be run routinely in both electrospray (ESI) mode (for liquid  chromatography,
              i.e., LC-MS or LC-MS-MS) and electron  impact/chemical ionization (EI/CI) mode
              (for gas  chromatography, i.e., GC-MS or GC-MS-MS).  Analysis of  carbohydrates
              by conventional LC has made great progress in  recent years.  A new LC system
              has been developed involving  a patented ion exchange column and pulsed
              amperometric  detector (PAD) which has become the "gold standard" in sugar 
              analysis.  Obtaining this LC will allow us to extend from  ESI-MS-MS into the
              field of ESI-MS-MS.  This represents the  state-of-the-art in carbohydrate
              analysis.
