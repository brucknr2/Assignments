Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This two-year award supports U.S.-France cooperative research                  
              in massively parallel computer systems between Milos Ercegovac                 
              of the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA), and Jean                  
              Michel Muller of the Ecole Normale Superieure, Lyon, France.                   
              The research focuses on theory, design and applications of an on-              
              line arithmetic approach with the ultimate goal of implementing                
              a class of fast and cost-effective algorithms suitable for specific            
              parallel computer systems.  The UCLA group brings to this                      
              collaboration their expertise on theory and design of an on-line               
              arithmetic approach and implementation of arithmetic algorithms                
              and structures in field programmable arrays.  This is                          
              complemented by the French investigator's extensive experience                 
              in custom VLSI (Very Large Scale Integration) and its                          
              application to massively parallel computers.                                   
                                                                                             
              Fast implementations for basic arithmetic operations have been                 
              of major interest since the development of the first generation of             
              computers.  Most current designs have been used in general-                    
              purpose and multiple processor systems, so that solutions that are             
              suitable for more specialized situations have not been fully                   
              explored.  The proposed cooperative research explores possible                 
              solutions and will enhance the development of specialized                      
              systems which require both high speed and the capability for                   
              executing algorithms composed of a large number of arithmetic                  
              operations.
