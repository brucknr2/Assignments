Abstract    :
              A program of construction of model stellar atmospheres for red                 
              giant stars will be continued.  This research program is nearly                
              unique in its treatment of the atmospheres of the coolest of stars.            
                                                                                             
              The presence of molecules and solid grains in the atmospheres                  
              present serious computational challenges.  Treatment of their                  
              effects will be improved over previous calculations.  These models             
              will be useful to a variety of investigators who are attempting to             
              interpret spectra.  The levitation effects of grains will be                   
              examined in detail and may shed light on mass loss.
