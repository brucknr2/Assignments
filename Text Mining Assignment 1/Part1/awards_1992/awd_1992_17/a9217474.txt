Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This three-year award supports U.S.-France cooperative research                
              in nuclear physics involving Stephen J. Sanders and Francis W.                 
              Prosser, University of Kansas, and Christian Beck at the Center                
              for Nuclear Research, Strasbourg, France.  The objective of the                
              research is to study the details of the formation and decay of                 
              highly deformed quasi-molecular resonances in light to medium                  
              mass heavy ion collisions.  Underlying the research is the role of             
              the fusion-fission mechanism in light nuclear systems.  The                    
              research involves experimental measurements in both the United                 
              States and France.  Initial measurements establishing the                      
              characteristics of the fission process in a mass 48 system will be             
              done using the ATLAS facility at Argonne National Laboratory.                  
              Subsequent measurement of energy-dependent, side-feeding of                    
              states in binary fragments will be produced using the                          
              EUROGAM detector located at the VIVITRON accelerator in                        
              Strasbourg, France.                                                            
                                                                                             
              The collaboration takes advantage of unique facilities in both the             
              U.S. and France. Different aspects of the problem will be                      
              addressed at the two facilities, with the (EUROGAM) work                       
              aimed at decay properties.  The project takes advantage of                     
              complementary expertise in the fusion-fission process in light nuclear         
              systems.
