Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The Grand Challenge Application Groups competition provides one                
              mechanism for the support of multidisciplinary teams of scientists             
              and engineers to meet the goals of the High Performance Computing              
              and Communications (HPCC) Initiative in Fiscal Year 1992.  The                 
              ideal proposal provided not only excellence in science: focussed               
              problem with potential for substantial impact in a critical area of            
              science and engineering but also significant interactions between              
              scientific and comptational activities, usually involving                      
              mathematical, computer or computational scientists, that would have            
              impact in high-performance computational activity beyond the                   
              specific scientific or engineering problem area(s) or discipline               
              being studied.  This proposal is for the direct implementation of              
              three computing recommendations of the Astronomy and Astrophyusics             
              Survey Committee.  It will implement a prototype of the next                   
              generation of astronomical telescope systems - remotely located                
              telescopes connected by high speed networks to very high                       
              performance, scalable architecture computers and on-line data                  
              archives.  The very computationally intensive algorithms for                   
              calibration and imaging of radio syntheseis array observations will            
              be optimized and new algorithms which utilize the massively                    
              parallel CM-5 will be developed.
