Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  This award supports a Small Grant for Exploratory Research                
              (SGER) to examine exposures of laminated sediments in Laguna Paron,            
              Peru.  This sediment section may provide a unique opportunity to               
              develop a high-resolution paleoclimate record from the central                 
              Andes that will compliment the ice-core record from the region.                
              The sediments were deposited in a proglacial delta environment.                
              Initial radiocarbon dates of wood indicate the sediments were                  
              deposited during the Little Ice Age.  It is anticipated that the               
              sediments will record glacial melt and runoff, whereas the ice                 
              cores primarily record glacial accumulation, thus the records in               
              tandem will give a complete seasonal signal of paleoclimate.  The              
              exposures are now at risk of being lost because the lake level,                
              which was artificially lowered in 1985, is being raised again.  The            
              initial lowering of the lake level produced downcutting in the                 
              delta and the first subaerial exposure of these sections.
