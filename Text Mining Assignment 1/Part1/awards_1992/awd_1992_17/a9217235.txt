Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Variations in the rate of recruitment and growth of organisms                  
              affects the relative abundance and dispersion of size classes                  
              within benthic prey populations.  These shifts may precipitate                 
              further changes in prey size structure because benthic predators               
              often seek or avoid certain prey sizes.  Although size-limited                 
              predation is widely recognized, little is known about                          
              size-dependant feedback, in which changing prey population                     
              structure influences subsequent structure through size dependant               
              predation.  Prior studies have suggested hypothetical feedback                 
              mechanisms in the interaction between spiny lobsters, Panulirus                
              interruptus, and its prey, the intertidal mussel, Mytilus                      
              californianus.  The mechanisms are: (1) a positive numerical                   
              response of the predators to densities of small mussels, and (2)               
              changes in mussel recruitment rates following the establishment of             
              a canopy of larger adult mussels.  Physical gradients of tidal and             
              wave exposure affect rates of mussel recruitment and growth, and               
              they also constrain predator foraging.  Therefore, the relative                
              strengths of feedback mechanisms may change over the gradients.                
              This project involves a series of field surveys and experiments                
              which will examine the various feedback mechanisms.
