Abstract    :
                   This award supports offshore coring into the coral reefs of               
              Barbados to retrieve a detailed sea level record for the past                  
              20,000 years.  U-series dating of the reef crest coral indicates               
              that sea level was approximately 120 meters below present sea level            
              during the last glacial maximum.  Sea level rise was not monotonic;            
              rather, it was marked by a series of jumps with rates of sea level             
              rise exceeding 2cm per year at least three times during the                    
              deglaciation.  The glacial meltwater associated with this sea level            
              rise is clearly recorded in the oxygen isotopic records of                     
              planktonic foraminifera.  Immediately preceding this sea level jump            
              was the initiation of North Atlantic Deep Water production and                 
              associated meridional heat transport.                                          
                   Measurement of C-14 and U-Series ages on the same coral                   
              samples, will also provide a unique opportunity to calibrate the C-            
              14 time scale beyond the 10,000 year dendrochronology.  The                    
              radiocarbon calibration beyond 10,000 years is critical for climate            
              research that compares radiocarbon-dated proxies with absolute                 
              chronologies based on annual layer counting, such as ice core                  
              records or astronomical calculation.  These results have immediate             
              implications for climate and geophysical models that incorporate               
              phase lags or rates of climate change based on calibrated                      
              radiocarbon records.
