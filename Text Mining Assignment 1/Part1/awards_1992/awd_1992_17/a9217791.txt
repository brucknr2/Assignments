Abstract    :
              9217791  Boyle       The PIs would like to take advantage of a rare passage of 
              the French vessel Marion Dufresne through the North Atlantic to  obtain long
              and large diameter piston cores on the Bermuda Rise.  Such a temperature
              latitude cores would contain a record that  could be similar to the Vostock Ice
              Core with high temporal  resolution.  The cores could become a principal tool
              for  resolving the climatic and paleoenvironmental record of the past  2-3
              glacial cycles, which is one of the prime objective of the  global change
              research program.  ***
