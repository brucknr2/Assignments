Abstract    :
              In this project, the PI and his team will continue a series of                 
              fundamental studies of turbulence using laboratory experiments to              
              model ocean conditions.  Focus will be on turbulent mixing in                  
              uniform-gradient shear flows, in Kelvin-Helmholtz billows, and in              
              a fluid with spatially varying Vaisala frequency.
