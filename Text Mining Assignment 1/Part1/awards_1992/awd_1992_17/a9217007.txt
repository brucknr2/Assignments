Abstract    :
              Radar observations at very high latitudes have revealed the                    
              existence of a region of enhanced backscatter in the polar summer              
              mesosphere.  This region of the atmosphere is the coldest place on             
              earth and is the location at which the highest clouds on earth are             
              observed: arctic noctilucent clouds.  In a previous NSF-funded                 
              study, the PI of this proposal has put forth the theory that the               
              enhanced radar echoes are charged aerosols and that these particles            
              are drifting slowly downward analogous to snow.  Although not                  
              accepted, the PI will continue to investigate this idea by studying            
              in more detail the manner in which the charged aerosol model can               
              account for the radar observations.  Furthermore, the PI will                  
              address specifically the question of the association between arctic            
              noctilucent clouds and these enhanced radar echoes in the polar                
              summer mesosphere.
