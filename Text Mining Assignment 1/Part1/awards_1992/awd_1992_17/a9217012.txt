              Santa Barbara, to organize and participate in                                  
              two research workshops on the Rietveld method,                                 
              in La Plata, Argentina December 7-11, 1992, and                                
              in Sao Paulo, Brazil December 14-16, 1992.  The                                
              Brazilian co-organizer is Yvonne Mascarenhas of                                
              the University of Sao Paulo; the Argentine co-                                 
              organizer is Graciela Punte of the University                                  
              of La Plata.                                                                   
                                                                                             
              The Rietveld method is a powerful new tool for                                 
              extracting detailed crystal structural                                         
              information from X-ray and neutron powder                                      
              diffraction data.  Since such structural                                       
              details dictate many physical and chemical                                     
              attributes of materials, knowledge of them is                                  
              crucial to understanding, modifying, and                                       
              creating materials that have properties needed                                 
              for specific uses.  The Rietveld method plays                                  
              an important role in research on the crystal                                   
              structural origins of HTc superconductivity.                                   
              Each workshop will include 35 mostly junior                                    
              local and regional participants.  The South                                    
              American participants will acquire an important                                
              method for understanding structure-property                                    
              relationships.  All sides will gain new ties                                   
              for research collaboration on problems of                                      
              mutual interest.
