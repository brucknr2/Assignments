Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Community structure of low rocky intertidal zones is strikingly                
              different on the Oregon coast.  This project will examine why an               
              intertidal zone with high sessile recruitment and phytoplankton                
              availability supports the highest levels of prey production, which             
              in turn supports high abundance of carnivores and herbivores.  The             
              postulated result of high consumer abundance is stronger predation             
              on, and weaker competition among, sessile organisms.  For contrast,            
              an intertidal zone with high nutrients and macroalgal abundance,               
              and low phytoplankton availability will also be examined.  Dr.                 
              Menge hypothesizes that higher nutrient uptake by the more abundant            
              macroalgae and/or shorter residence time of nutrients and                      
              phytoplankton in nearshore is due to stronger offshore currents.               
              To tests these hypotheses, research scientists will quantify: (1)              
              nutrients, chlorophyll and productivity on- and offshore, (2)                  
              current/upwelling regimes, (3) recruitment rates and larval                    
              abundance, (4) prey and macroalgal growth rates, and (5)                       
              intensities of predation, grazing, and competition at both sites.              
              The project will also evaluate the generality of the influence of              
              nearshore water column processes on intertidal community processes             
              by quantitative surveys of community structure and dynamics, and               
              oceanographic conditions at other locations along the Oregon coast.            
              The results from the project will provide considerable insight into            
              the influence of nearshore oceanographic conditions on community               
              structure in low rocky intertidal habitats.
