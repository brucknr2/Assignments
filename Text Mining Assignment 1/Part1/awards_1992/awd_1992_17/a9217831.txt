Abstract    :
                This workshop is and NSF-initiated planning workshop to determine            
              research problems in the area of facial expression understanding               
              that deserve future funding.   The main goals are (a) to identify              
              the most important areas of research on how to extract information             
              from facial activity relevant to a persons emotional, cognitive               
              and physical state; (b) to enhance communication between man and               
              machine through the development of emerging computer vision capture            
              techniques for facial processing and categorization of facial                  
              expression; (c) to consider how we can facilitate the training of              
              new investigators in the relevant fields.  The workshop will                   
              produce a set of recommendations to the investigative community and            
              to  NSF to help guide funding opportunities.  There will be                    
              publications in standard journals of a report.The workshop                     
              participants represent a balance of researchers in the areas of                
              facial expression understanding, computer vision and human computer            
              interaction.  Participants include researchers with NSF grants and             
              researchers in government and industrial laboratories.  The                    
              workshop will consist of plenary sessions and breakout groups                  
              focused on several research areas.  The steering committee includes            
              Dr. Paul Ekman of the University of California at San Francisco,               
              Dr. Thomas Huang of the University of Illinois at Champaign-Urbana             
              and Dr. Terrence Sejnowski of the Salk Institute.
