Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The above-referenced proposal asks for support to conduct heat flow            
              and electrical resistivity/transient EM measurements of sections of            
              the so-called TAG (Trans-Atlantic Geotraverse) hydrothermal field              
              associated with the north-central Mid-Atlantic mid-ocean spreading             
              ridge.  Proposed work could result in significant augmentation of              
              ALVIN geophysical measurement capabilities, as well as provide                 
              geophysical characterization of the extent and nature of the                   
              hydrothermal deposits at the TAG site, a candidate for future                  
              drilling in the 1994-1995 time-frame.
