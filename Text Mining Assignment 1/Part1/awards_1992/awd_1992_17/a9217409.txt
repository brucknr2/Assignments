Abstract    :
              With the general goals of better understanding the                             
              ecological and evolutionary consequences of behavioral,                        
              anatomical, developmental, and physiological variation, we                     
              will use the capacity to adequately record and analyze                         
              animal motion for the study of a wide variety of behaviors                     
              and functions in vertebrates and  invertebrates.  By                           
              studying different individuals within a single species and                     
              different species, motion analysis will be used to define,                     
              quantify and compare different behaviors (movements) and                       
              determine the relative effectiveness of animals performing                     
              tasks such as sprinting locomotion, feeling, and                               
              communicating with potential mates.  Simultaneous records of                   
              motion and muscle activity, will be used to examine the                        
              neural control of animal movements and its evolutionary                        
              interrelationships with anatomical variation.  Playback                        
              experiments using video images modified with animation                         
              techniques will be used to asses the relative importance of                    
              different movements versus anatomy in the species                              
              recognition and mating behaviors.
