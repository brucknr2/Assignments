Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This project will focus on obtaining constraints on deviatoric                 
              stresses and thermal parameters associated with extension, normal              
              faulting, and magma intrusion at MORs.  This will be done by                   
              calibrating microstructures as a function of stress and then                   
              applying this information to Layer 3 gabbros.  They will take a                
              multiprong approach that ranges from TEM study of the                          
              microstructures, thermometry of two pyroxenes, to high-T                       
              deformation experiments on cpx and plagioclase.
