Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  Based on the 'void volume' incorporated into the                          
              infrastructure of pre-dense packed, dendritic macromolecules, a                
              series of novel polymers will be constructed that possess internal,            
              specifically located, metal, metalloid, and/or heterocyclic                    
              moieties.  The proposed research will emphasize the synthesis and              
              characterization of water-soluble cascade polymers with easily                 
              functionalized lipophilic interiors.  These transformations will               
              focus on the potential to manipulate internal reactive sites, at               
              each generation, after cascade superstructure construction.                    
              Modification of the interior of these unimolecular micelles will               
              allow preparation of metallospheres which are specifically                     
              designed, water-soluble catalysts.  Characterization of these                  
              macromolecules will be accomplished via the standard techniques of             
              NMR spectroscopy, electron microscopy, light-scattering,                       
              fluorescent-probe methods, solubility, osmotic pressure                        
              conductivity, and mass spectroscopy.  The potential to perform                 
              chemistry within a micellar environment, inside a single molecule,             
              will be investigated in detail.  The use of these cascade polymers             
              as solubilizing agents, microencapsulating agents, and host-                   
              transport agents will be continued.                                            
                                                                                             
              This research deals with the synthesis and properties of a new                 
              class of large spherical molecules.  Because they are designed to              
              have voids in their structure, it will be possible to incorporate              
              various types of functional materials within these new structures.             
              Their potential in various applications will be investigated.
