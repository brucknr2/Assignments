Abstract    :
              9217584  Slanger       The photochemistry of the earth's atmosphere is dominated
              by  molecular oxygen in its diatomic and triatomic forms.  Oxygen  absorbs much
              of the solar radiation in the ultraviolet for 100 to  240 nm, leading to the
              formation of ozone.  The structured nature  of the oxygen absorption spectrum,
              and the consequent wide  variations in the absorption cross section, mean that
              uv radiation  is absorbed over a wide range of altitudes.  Some wavelengths are
               absorbed above 100 km, while others descend below 40km, where they  can
              initiate chemistry in anthropogenic species diffusing upward  from the ground. 
                   Thus quantitative modeling of ozone production and other  solar-induced
              photochemistry in the atmosphere requires detailed  knowledge of the absorption
              spectrum of ozone, the spectral  distribution of ultraviolet solar radiation
              (including solar cycle  variations), and radiative transport through the
              atmosphere.   Recent research in laborators and elsewhere suggests that the 
              existing data and mechanistic understanding are far from adequate.       This
              project involves experimental, theoretical, and modeling  research to improve
              our knowledge of the absorption of ultraviolet  radiation in the atmosphere. 
              Four main topics are emphasized: (1)  measurement of rotational and
              finestructure resolved linewidths for  each upper vibrational level in the
              ozone Schumann-Runge band  system; (2) theoretical analysis of the interactions
              between the  ozone state and its four predissociating states, based on the 
              experimental linewidths, (3) comparison of current models for solar  energy 
              deposition with that resulting from folding the  experimental linewidths into
              the true solar spectrum; and (4)  measurement of line-resolved absolute
              photoabsorption cross  sections for ozone in the A-X,A'-X, and c-X Herzberg
              bands.
