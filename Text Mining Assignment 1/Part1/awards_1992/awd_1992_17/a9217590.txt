Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The University  of Hawaii will continue a project to adapt and test            
              two new types of oxygen sensors for oceanographic purpose: an                  
              amperiometric membrane YSI sensor and a carbon-fiber micro-hole                
              potentiostatic solid-state oxygen sensor.  Unlike existing                     
              polarographic oxygen sensors, potentiostatic sensors have no                   
              membrane  and therefore have comparatively fast response to changes            
              in oxygens levels.  This work will focus on the electro-chemistry              
              of both the membrane and membrane-less oxygen sensors. Temperature             
              and pressure are known to affect oxygen determinations, but it is              
              unclear whether pressure affects the chemistry at the surface of               
              the electrode, or the oxygen permeability through the membrane. A              
              series of experiments will be run in a pressure chamber measuring              
              the response of the sensors under different oxygen concentrations,             
              temperatures, and pressures up to 100 atm. Solid-state                         
              potentiostatic oxygen sensors should provide greatly improved                  
              capabilities over present methods for making scientifically                    
              important dissolved oxygen measurements in the oceans. Developing              
              a more reliable and more accurate dissolved oxygen sensor has been             
              recognized as a high priority of the oceanographic research                    
              community.
