Abstract    :
              In this project in the Theoretical and Computational Chemistry                 
              Program of the Division of Chemistry, investigations are being                 
              carried out to elucidate the mechanisms of photodissociation,                  
              geminate recombination, and vibrational relaxation of diatomic                 
              negative ions imbedded within molecular clusters.  These ions                  
              include diatomic halogen anions solvated by carbon dioxide                     
              molecules.  The methods of electron transfer theory are being                  
              combined with molecular dynamics simulations to study the                      
              interplay between charge localization and solvation.

              Molecular ions in the gas-phase can become "solvated" by                       
              surrounding neutral molecules in much the same way as metal                    
              ions become "solvated" by water molecules in aqueous solution.                 
              In this study theoretical and computational methods are being                  
              used to characterize such clusters and their interactions with                 
              light.
