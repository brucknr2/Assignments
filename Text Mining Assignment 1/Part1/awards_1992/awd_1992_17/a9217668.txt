Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This is a no-cost award to Dr. Alan Chave of the Woods Hole                    
              Oceanographic Institution to support a U.S.-Japan Cooperative                  
              Research Project with Professor Junzo Kasahara of the University of            
              Tokyo.  The project allows Japanese scientists to participate in               
              work on an extensive submarine cable system covering the North                 
              Pacific.  One segment of the Trans Pacific-1 (TPC-1) running from              
              Guam to Japan is currently in scientific powered service, and is               
              under joint U.S.-Japanese ownership.  It is anticipated that the               
              remainder of TPC-1 extending to Hawaii as well as two cables                   
              stretching from Hawaii to the mainland United States will be used              
              for passive monitoring of the geoelectric field in the near future.
