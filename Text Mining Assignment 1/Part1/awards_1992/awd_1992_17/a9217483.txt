Abstract    :
              Mass Spectrometric Tracer Pulse Chromatography will be used to                 
              investigate phase-distribution equilibria in a variety of                      
              systems, including 1) a study of the basic retention mechanisms                
              in supercritical fluid chromatography, 2) surface-coverage                     
              programming strategies for gas-solid chromatography, 3) a                      
              fundamental investigation of "excess" and "absolute" adsorption                
              of supercritical fluid mixtures, and 4) a thorough exploration                 
              of the effect of supercritical carbon dioxide on the phase                     
              transitions and sorption properties of polymers. The common                    
              theme of all these projects is the investigations of weak                      
              molecular interactions.  The phase-distribution isotherm data                  
              will be valuable for the development of fundamental adsorption                 
              and solution theoretical models, and information on                            
              supercritical fluid chromatographic mechanisms will aid in the                 
              development of new separation schemes.

              Fundamental studies of the phenomena which will be investigated                
              in this project are crucial for better understanding of a wide                 
              variety of physical and chemical processes, such as                            
              chromatography, catalysis, polymer processing and extraction                   
              schemes.
