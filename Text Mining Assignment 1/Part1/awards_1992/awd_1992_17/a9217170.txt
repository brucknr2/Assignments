Abstract    :
              This project, in the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program,                 
              will support a fundamental investigation of the processes that                 
              control the sensitivity, precision and accuracy of multielement                
              analysis via inductively coupled plasma optical emission and                   
              mass spectrometry.  Desolvation of sample aerosols, particle                   
              vaporization, analyte ionization and excitation of atoms and                   
              ions will all be studied; however, the particular focus of the                 
              investigation will be plasma-sample interactions. Measurements                 
              of sample aerosol characteristics, atom and ion concentrations                 
              in the plasma, excitation and ionization will be carried out in                
              a systematic attempt to separately investigate the complex                     
              mechanisms of signal generation in a plasma.

              This project involves a basic investigation of the factors                     
              controlling the generation of analytically useful signals from                 
              atoms and ions in a plasma.  The goal is to improve                            
              multielement analytical capabilities for the analysis of                       
              geological, environmental, biological, material, and                           
              agricultural samples.
