Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This award supports a two-year collaborative research project                  
              between Professor Antal Jevicki of Brown University and Professor              
              Tamiaki Yoneya of the University of Tokyo.  This project is an                 
              effort to solve the central questions in string theory and quantum             
              gravity.  The goals are to develop an understanding and complete               
              formulation of the non-perturbative dynamics through the                       
              investigation of exactly solvable low-dimensional models, and to               
              ultimately apply these results to higher-dimensional theories and              
              the physics of black holes, early cosmology, and ultra-high energy             
              physics where present theories are known to break down.                        
              Specifically the research will involve matrix models, conformal                
              field theory, non-perturbative string dynamics, symmetry breaking,             
              w-symmetry, topological phases, and high-energy behavior.                      
                                                                                             
              The principal investigators have already uncovered some of the key             
              aspects of the rich dynamics of these theories and have                        
              collaborated in developing an action principle.  This research                 
              project will enable them to vigorously expand these lines of                   
              research and extend the collaboration to include the related                   
              efforts of other colleagues.
