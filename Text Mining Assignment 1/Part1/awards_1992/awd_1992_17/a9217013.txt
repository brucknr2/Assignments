Abstract    :
              This award will allow a research group from the University                     
              of Virginia to purchase a 500 MHz Nuclear Magnetic Resonance                   
              spectrometer for studies of protein structure and dynamics.                    
              Specific examples of research topics to be pursued include                     
              structural studies of glutathione transferases and                             
              cardiotoxins, studies of antibody-antigen interactions,                        
              examination of the activation of phospholipase A2, and                         
              structural studies of active-site peptides of Na,K-ATPase.
