Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                                                                                             
                                                                                            
              The project focuses on a question of fundamental importance for                
              understanding the global oceanic carbon cycle:  What factors and               
              processes control whether organic matter deposited in marine                   
              sediments will be remineralized or buried.  Organic matter                     
              deposition, remineralization, and burial will be studied at sites              
              along transects in a shallow, highly productive North Carolina                 
              coastal lagoon and on the upper continental slope off Cape                     
              Hatteras, NC.  Specific objectives include: (1) determination of               
              how the fraction of organic carbon deposition that is remineralized            
              varies along these two coastal transects, (2) determination of                 
              sources and ages of the reactive fraction, (3) determination of the            
              chemical composition of reactive and unreactive fractions of the               
              organic matter at sites along these transects, and (4)                         
              determination of the effect of respiratory mode on organic matter              
              remineralization rates and chemical composition of buried material.            
              Objectives (1), (2), and (3) involve extensive field work while                
              objective (4) involves as well-controlled laboratory microcosm                 
              study.  Combining field data and laboratory experiments provides a             
              powerful tool for directly testing hypotheses regarding the                    
              mechanisms by which environmental parameters influence organic                 
              matter reactivity.
