Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              A major area of interest within the biological oceanographic                   
              community is the ability to assess the factors affecting population            
              abundances of marine organisms and the potential role of climate               
              change on marine species. For zooplankton species, it is                       
              hypothesized that nutritional regime can profoundly affect                     
              zooplankton abundance and survival. However, current techniques to             
              assess nutritional and physiological condition in zooplankton to               
              evaluate this hypothesis are rather insensitive and/or difficult to            
              apply. Additionally, analysis of field data from biological studies            
              usually lags behind the availability of physical measurements. This            
              project will develop shipboard activity (rate) assays for enzymes              
              of metabolism and growth in several species of marine zooplankton              
              including two species (larvae of the cod, Gadus morhua and the                 
              copepod, Calanus finmarchicus) which are important components of an            
              of the Georges Bank ecosystem, which is a region of interest in the            
              zooplankton and fisheries community.  The assays once developed                
              will be used to test the vertical-stratification hypothesis for                
              zooplankton survival in the Georges Bank region.  The objectives               
              will be accomplished by: (1) laboratory optimization of the enzyme             
              assay conditions;  (2)  correlation of physiological parameters                
              (e.g., respiration rates) with enzyme activities to validate                   
              molecular proxies; (3) estimation of physiological condition in                
              field-caught specimens by use of these enzyme activity proxies.
