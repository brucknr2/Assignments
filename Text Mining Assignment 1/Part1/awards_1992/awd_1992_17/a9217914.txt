Abstract    :
              This award will partially fund the expenses for about ten                      
              participants in the "1993 New England Doppler Conference".  This               
              conference will be held in Lakeville, Connecticut on May 25 to                 
              28, 1993.  The conference will be divided into twelve sessions                 
              and the topics will include, among others, Doppler frequency                   
              analysis, the detection of flow in multiple directions,                        
              hemodynamics, velocity displays and future applications.  This                 
              conference is important since it will bring together a group of                
              participants from diverse areas to discuss future directions in                
              research in Doppler ultrasound.  The meeting should stimulate                  
              research into emerging areas important to the advancement of the               
              field.
