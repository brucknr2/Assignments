Abstract    :
              This grant from the Special Projects Office of the Chemistry                   
              Division provides funds to enable Dr. Walter Benson to                         
              represent the International Organization for Chemical Sciences                 
              in Development (IOCD) at the 5th International Conference on                   
              Chemistry in Africa, which will occur July 27-31 in Gaborone,                  
              Botswana.  The IOCD encourages research in natural product                     
              chemistry in Africa, promoting cooperation among the natural                   
              products chemists in Africa and with chemists in the U.S. and                  
              other more developed nations.  Dr. Benson will report to the                   
              Foundation concerning the status of chemical research in Africa                
              and the opportunities for collaboration with U.S. scientists.                  
              African plants are a rich source of unusual organic compounds,                 
              many of which have potential value as natural insecticides,                    
              fungicides, or pharmaceuticals.
