Abstract    :
              The contractor for this project will conduct the Joint NSF/NIH                 
              Survey of Public Understanding of Science.  The 1992 survey                    
              continues a series of surveys started in 1979, and will expand                 
              the survey program significantly.  In addition to conducting the               
              traditional NSF-sponsored survey of approximately 2,000 adults,                
              the contractor will develop a new questionnaire focussing on                   
              biomedical sciences, and will conduct this new, second                         
              questionnaire with 3,000 adults, including 1,000 blacks and 1,000              
              Hispanics.  The contractor will conduct field tests, a non-                    
              response bias study, and be responsible for a long-range planning              
              study.  The contractor will also prepare various analytical                    
              reports for NSF and NIH.                                                       
                                                                                             
              The data from this project will be used in Science & Engineering               
              Indicators-1993, a congressionally-mandated report.  This survey               
              project is closely coordinated with similar surveys in Japan and               
              the nations of the European Community, all of which will share                 
              the results of their surveys.
