Abstract    :
                   Scientists from the University of Nebraska and Colorado State             
              University will carry out an integrated program of research on                 
              field micrometeorological measurements, process studies and                    
              modeling of methane and carbon dioxide fluxes in a boreal wetland              
              ecosystem, as part of the BOREAS Project in Canada.  The program               
              has four components:                                                           
                   1.   Quantification of surface exchange rates of methane and              
                        carbon dioxide at a boreal wetland site over the course              
                        of a growing season using the micrometeorological eddy               
                        correlation technique.                                               
                   2.   Evaluation of the variability of methane and carbon                  
                        dioxide fluxes across the landscape using chambers.                  
                   3.   Process studies (field experimental manipulations) to                
                        quantify the degree of substrate or nutrient limitations             
                        of methane production and oxidation.  Responses of leaf              
                        photosynthesis, plant respiration and stomatal conductance           
                        of dominant vascular plant species to relevant                       
                        controlling variables will be quantified experimentally.             
                   4.   Integration of the first three components to test and                
                        improve a model of decomposition and methane emission.               
                   The field measurements will allow temporal variation in fluxes            
              of methane and carbon dioxide to be related to underlying                      
              biological and biophysical processes.  These measurements are                  
              needed to support modeling of methane emission from northern                   
              wetland ecosystems.
