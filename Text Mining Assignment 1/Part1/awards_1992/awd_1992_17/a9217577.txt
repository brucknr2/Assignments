Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Investigations of the superfluid (sf) transition in liquid helium              
              4:  1)  Study helium containing aerogels as an impurity, measuring             
              the thermal expansion and thermal conductivity.  Data on the                   
              concentration and pressure dependences will illuminate the                     
              relationship between the phase transitions in the pure and impure              
              systems.  2)  Study the propagation of second sound near the sf                
              transition in the presence of superfluid and normal-fluid velocity             
              fields, to test the correctness of a recent theory.                            
              %%%                                                                            
              Quantum mechanics underlies and governs the behavior of all matter.            
              Liquid helium is almost unique in being a substance which behaves              
              as a quantum mechanical system on a macroscopic scale.  Studies                
              such as are here proposed can be expected to advance their                     
              understanding of quantum physics, as well as phase transitions and             
              the special properties of porous materials.
