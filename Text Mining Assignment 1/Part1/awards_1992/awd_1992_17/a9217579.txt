Abstract    :
              This proposal covers a project to design and                                   
              fabricate normal-incidence multiple quantum                                    
              well infrared detectors (QWIPs) in a                                           
              collaborative effort between ETDL and                                          
              Cornell University.  QWIPs have been                                           
              investigated as potential components of high                                   
              performance, two-dimensional imaging arrays.                                   
              At ETDL, research on the QWIPs use                                             
              electrons as carriers, with detectivities                                      
              competitive with II-VI detectors commercially                                  
              available.  However, because of the selection                                  
              rule for an electron to undergo an                                             
              intersubband transition normal incidence                                       
              illumination of a an array of detectors is not                                 
              possible.  In response to this, QWIPs using                                    
              hole intersubband transitions have recently                                    
              been investigated.
