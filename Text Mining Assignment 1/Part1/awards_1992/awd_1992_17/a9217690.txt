Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This awards supports the participation of eleven U.S. scientists               
              in a U.S.-Japan Seminar on Physics and Chemistry of C60 and                    
              Related Compounds, to be held in Honolulu, Hawaii July 18-24,                  
              1993.  The co-organizers are Professor John Fischer of the                     
              University of Pennsylvania and Professor Yusei Maruyama of the                 
              Institute for Molecular Science, Okazaki, Japan.  In addition to               
              the U.S. and Japanese participants, scientists from France,                    
              Portugal, and the Netherlands will be invited.                                 
                                                                                             
              Research on fullerenes and fullerene-based materials continues to              
              expand at a rapid pace.  U.S. and Japanese researchers are very                
              active in this new field.  Several individual national scientific              
              meetings have emphasized this topic, but this is the first                     
              opportunity for discussions between researchers from the two                   
              countries.  The objective of the seminar is to achieve a more                  
              detailed understanding of the unusual physical properties of                   
              fullerene-based materials, in particular the structural and                    
              electronic properties of various doped and intercalated phases.                
              Attempts will be made to reconcile data obtained from powder,                  
              single crystal and thin film samples, with a view to establishing              
              a general model for explaining the evolution of crystal structure              
              and electronic ground state with doping and the mechanism of                   
              superconductivity.  The seminar will emphasize new fullerenes,                 
              chemical modification at the molecular level, and the                          
              superconducting alkali metal-intercalated C60 compounds.
