Abstract    :
              This award in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic                  
              Program provides continued support for the research program of                 
              Dr. Mark S. Wrighton of the Chemistry Department, Massachusetts                
              Institute of Technology.  This investigation is concerned with                 
              the photochemistry and electrochemistry of organometallic                      
              molecules attached to surfaces.  Four studies will be pursued:                 
              (1) the rate and stability of attachment of various functional                 
              groups to metal surfaces; (2) the photochemistry of                            
              surface-confined organometallic molecules; (3) the chemistry of                
              metal complexes with redox-active pendant groups that can be                   
              used to "tune" the reactivity of the metal center; and (4)                     
              synthesis and characterization of metal complexes which show                   
              reversible electrochemical response and can be attached to                     
              metal surfaces.  In study (1), particular attention will be                    
              paid to platinum, gold, and indium/tin oxide surfaces which are                
              useful as microelectrodes.  Manganese carbonyl compounds which                 
              are photosensitive and can exchange multiple CO groups will be                 
              used in study (2), as will some ruthenium ammine and                           
              ferrocyanide complexes.                                                        
              %%%                                                                            
              Dr. Wrighton will investigate the interaction of organometallic                
              compounds with metal surfaces.  By varying the metal and the                   
              groups attached to it in these complexes, electronic and                       
              photochemical characteristics can be manipulated. This research                
              is relevant to many areas of surface chemistry, such as the                    
              functionalization of electrodes and microelectrodes for energy                 
              conversion and sensors, or the synthesis, adhesion, and wetting                
              of interfaces.
