Abstract    :
                   The research program focuses on mathematical aspects of                   
              object recognition.  There are two classes of problems. The first              
              is the recognition of rigid objects positioned in a scene at                   
              arbitrary rotations, locations, and scales.  A large repertoire                
              of shapes is assumed known in advance, and the problem is to then              
              devise computationally efficient algorithms for recognizing                    
              which, if any, of these objects are present in a given scene.                  
              Sequential and adaptive strategies will be explored, in which a                
              sequence of image-based observations is made, with the choice of               
              an observation depending upon the results of previous                          
              observations.  There are close connections to coding theory,                   
              sequential design of experiments, multi-armed bandit problems,                 
              the game of "twenty questions," and, of course, previous work in               
              machine vision.                                                                
                   The second class of problems is the recognition of nonrigid,              
              or deformable, objects.  Examples include handwritten numerals                 
              and various biological shapes, such as leaves, hands, organelles,              
              etc. Here the issue of shape modeling appears to be central.  An               
              approach through  deformable templates is proposed.  Templates                 
              are prototypes which capture global characteristics, whereas                   
              deformations are random transformations, satisfying certain                    
              regularity constraints, that act upon templates to produce the                 
              possible presentations of an object.  The proposed shape models                
              suggest certain recognition algorithms, and these will be                      
              explored in a variety of application areas.
