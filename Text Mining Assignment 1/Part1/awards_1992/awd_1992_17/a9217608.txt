Abstract    :
              This project is attempting to engineering a bacterium, using no                
              more than currently available technology, intro an intracellular,              
              seed-transmissible endosymbiont that functions as a plant                      
              'organelle'.  The approach is based on a screen designed to select             
              directly for endosymbiosis.  An SGER would allow us to test the                
              feasibility of the method.  We will construct Bacillus subtilis Kan            
              (kanamycin-resistant) Hyg (hygromycin-resistant) Gus (B-                       
              glucuronidase); derive L-forms from it; introduce these into                   
              tobacco protoplasts; select for callus simultaneously resistant to             
              Kan on the presence of endosymbiotic 'organelles'.  If this proves             
              feasible, it would permit a full-scale research project to develop             
              conditions for optimization of selection and regeneration of                   
              endosymbiotic callus into whole plants.  Several arguments suggest             
              the approach is feasible in principle.  These include not only the             
              straightforward selection and simple technology, but also the large            
              number of endosymbioses found in nature, and particularly the                  
              reports of laboratory-induced endosymbiosis in Amoeba and plant                
              cells.                                                                         
              %%%                                                                            
              Organelle engineering would allow plants to be equipped with                   
              agronomically valuable metabolic and physiological capabilities                
              that are too complex to be introduced by gene transfer, would also             
              provide a practical system for system endosymbiosis in the                     
              laboratory.
