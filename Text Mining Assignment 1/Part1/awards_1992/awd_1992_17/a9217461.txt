Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The project will allow the P.I. to continue a geochemical and                  
              isotopic study of S. Atlantic MORBs that identified a significant              
              geochemical anomaly at 33S on the MAR axis.  The 33S anomaly                   
              appears to be very different from all other anomalies along the MAR            
              axis and the P.I. proposed some hypotheses for the origin of this              
              anomaly.  He will combine the geochemical and isotopic data to be              
              gathered with geophysical and bathymetric measurements to test                 
              these hypotheses.
