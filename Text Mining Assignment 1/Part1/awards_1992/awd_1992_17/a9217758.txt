Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The logographic writing system of the Micmac Indians of                        
              the Atlantic coast of Canada will be analyzed in its                           
              linguistic, historical, and functional contexts.  This                         
              research is significant for two important reasons: (1) it is                   
              the only indigenous writing system in North America; and (2)                   
              it has never been completely deciphered.                                       
                                                                                             
              Particular emphasis will be placed on secular uses of                          
              the script in personal messages, legal documents,                              
              declarations of war, and dairies.  The system's evolution                      
              from a traditional symbology, and the possibility of a                         
              precontact written language will be explored.  Also to be                      
              investigated will be the role hieroglyphic literacy played                     
              in the establishment, growth, and maintenance of Catholicism                   
              among Micmacs.
