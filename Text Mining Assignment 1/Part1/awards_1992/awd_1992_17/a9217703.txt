Abstract    :
                    The  discovery in April , 1991 of newly-formed hydrothermal              
              vents  located  in areas of recent and intense volcanic  activity              
              between  9o45'  and  9o52'N along the  East  Pacific  Rise  (EPR)              
              affords, for the first time, the opportunity to follow biological              
              and  geological changes over time from the apparent "birth" of  a              
              number   of   deep-sea  hydrothermal  vents.   Observations   and              
              measurements made using the submersible Alvin in March, 1992,  11              
              months  after  an active eruptive event, have indicated  dramatic              
              changes  in  geological  features, vent  fluid  geochemistry  and              
              biological community structure over the 11-month period since the              
              eruptive  events  was  observed on the seafloor  in  the  region.              
              During the March, 1992 cruise, 210 markers were deployed along  a              
              1.4  km  stretch  of the axial summit caldera (ASC)  of  the  EPR              
              between  9o49.61' and 9o50.36'N.  The resulting  transect,  which              
              traversed  numerous active vent areas, was extensively documented              
              utilizing a variety of 35 mm, electronic still camera,  and  Hi-8              
              video  capabilities.  The primary objective of this study  is  to              
              document  over  a  3-year period temporal changes  in  biological              
              community  structure and associated geological features  observed              
              along  this  active segment of the mid-oceanic ridge  axis.   The              
              approach  involves  a combination of: (1) numerous  35  mm,  Hi-8              
              video,  and  electronic still camera (ESC) imaging surveys  along              
              the  recently marked 1.4 km stretch of the ASC; and (2) long term              
              time-lapse   photography   (Hi-8   video)   at   three-designated              
              "sanctuaries"  within this hydrothermally active  region  of  the              
              ASC.
