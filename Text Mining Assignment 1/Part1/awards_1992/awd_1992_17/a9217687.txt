Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This award supports the participation of 13 U.S. scientists in a               
              U.S.-Japan Seminar on Macromolecular Design for Advanced                       
              Materials, to be held in Napa Valley, California November 6 to                 
              12, 1993.  The co-organizers are Professor Virgil Percec of Case               
              Western Reserve University and Professor Yukio Imanishi of Kyoto               
              University.  The focus of the meeting will be on the most recent               
              advances in the elaboration of novel polymerization methods and                
              their use in the design of new and well-defined complex                        
              macromolecular architectures capable of generating advanced                    
              materials with controlled optical, electronic, ionic, biomedical,              
              high-strength and other special properties.                                    
                                                                                             
              This meeting is the sixth in a series of U.S.-Japan seminars in                
              this field held over a period of 18 years.  The seminar is timely              
              because advanced materials underlie current and projected                      
              developments in the electronics, communications, aerospace,                    
              automotive, and health care industries.  Important contributions               
              are being made in each of these areas in the United States and                 
              Japan, and increased exchange of ideas and information should                  
              lead to further collaborative research between scientists in the               
              two countries.
