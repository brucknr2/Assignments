Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This two-year award supports U.S.-France cooperative research in               
              climate dynamics and paleoclimatology and involves Douglas                     
              Martinson and William Howard of Columbia University's Lamont-                  
              Doherty Geological Observatory and Laurent Labeyrie of the Centre              
              des Faibles Radioactivites, the French National Center for                     
              Scientific Research.  The investigators will study problems of                 
              Quaternary climate dynamics and geochronology in Antarctic deep-               
              sea cores.  The objectives of their research are to integrate and              
              synthesize data sets and to advance knowledge of the temporal and              
              spatial patterns of physical climate and the geochemical changes.              
                                                                                             
              Researchers in the U.S. and France have made significant progress              
              in understanding the role of the Southern Ocean in Quaternary                  
              climate change and in modulating atmospheric chemistry. Deep-sea               
              cores in the French and U.S. collections are well suited for                   
              complementary studies.  The French group has extensive experience              
              with cores which cover the last 160,000 years at resolutions of                
              1000 years and less.  Whereas, the U.S. researchers have analyzed              
              and studied paleoclimate records which cover the past 400,000 to               
              500,000 years at resolutions of 3000-5000 years.  Through the                  
              proposed program, the investigators will have access to new                    
              French cores with a range of age intervals and resolutions.                    
              Their efforts will place both the French and U.S. records on                   
              common time scales, and provide a synthesis of the                             
              paleoecological and geochemical records.
