Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              It is proposed to study small-scale velocity differences in open               
              and closed turbulent flows.  Of special interest is the cross-over             
              from the chaotic state (few degrees of freedom) to the fully                   
              turbulent state, where "cascade" ideas of turbulence may be                    
              applied.  The turbulence will be probed by conventional techniques,            
              such as laser Doppler velocimetry, and also by homodyne light                  
              scattering, which permits the measurement of velocity differences              
              without making the "frozen-turbulence" assumption.  Also to be                 
              studied are:  the dynamics of phase-separation of fluids and liquid            
              crystals contained in porous media; and nucleation in fluid                    
              mixtures under uniform shear.  The common thread running through               
              all of this work is that of systems driven far from equilibrium.               
              %%%                                                                            
              The research deals with "self-similar" phenomena which have the                
              property that they look the same when viewed on all scales of                  
              magnification.  Turbulent fluids exhibit this self-similarity,                 
              which will be studied by light scattering.  Another self-similar               
              occurrence is the motion of fluids constrained within porous media             
              (e.g., oil in sand).  The goal is to understand the origin of this             
              self-similarity.
