Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              A study of the origin of the Galapagos plume is underway; the                  
              feature is documented through satellite ocean color images showing             
              a marked plume of high phytoplankton pigments streaming off the                
              Galapagos Islands.  The phenomenon of enhanced phytoplankton                   
              abundance down current from the Galapagos Islands has also been                
              observed via traditional shipboard studies.  The high productivity             
              zone in a region marked by low productivity, high nutrient waters              
              may result from one of several hypothesized processes: 1.                      
              Introduction of a "seed" population from the Galapagos platform                
              waters which then generates the observed bloom.  2. Disruption of              
              an environmental balance dominated by zooplankton, and a bloom                 
              caused when flow of water over the platform causes zooplankton to              
              lose control, and 3. Introduction of the scarce element Fe into the            
              nutrient rich waters as they pass near the Galapagos Islands,                  
              allowing a previously inhibited bloom condition to develop.                    
              Measurements of nutrients, Fe and other trace elements,                        
              productivity, POC, DOC, PON, DON, phytoplankton and zooplankton                
              growth rates and related parameters around and inside the plume are            
              planned to test the hypotheses.
