Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                                                                                            
              Oceanic waters contain predominantly the stable form of iodine                 
              (iodate), but significant amounts of iodide are found in surface               
              waters.  Iodine is incorporated in a reduced form into                         
              phytoplankton in the photic zone of the ocean.  Some of this iodine            
              can be transported to oceanic sediments in particulate organic                 
              carbon and to the atmosphere as volatile forms, but much remains in            
              the upperwater column where iodide accumulates due to                          
              remineralization of particulate organic carbon.  Iodide oxidation              
              to iodate is not an important chemical process in seawater.                    
              Preliminary results show detectable speciation changes over a year             
              at one location due to oceanic mixing.  This research will                     
              investigate the use iodine speciation as an indicator of primary               
              productivity.  The changes noted above, in conjunction with                    
              sediment trap iodine analyses, will be monitored over time at a                
              time series location to understand iodine and carbon cycling.                  
              Precise methods for the measurement of both iodide and iodate are              
              now available for a study of this type.
