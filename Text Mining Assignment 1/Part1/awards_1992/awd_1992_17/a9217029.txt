Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The goal of this project is to increase the understanding of how               
              the dynamics of the bottom boundary layer affect coastal                       
              circulation on continental margins containing a shelfbreak front.              
              Data collected in the Mid-Atlantic Bight were chosen for this study            
              because the shelfbreak front in that region is a robust and                    
              persistent feature.                                                            
                                                                                             
              The major scientific goals of this project are: evaluate the bottom            
              boundary layer thickness, conduct an analysis of the circulation               
              near the shelfbreak front, and study the bottom flow on the slope.             
              In addition, the study of the bottom flow on the slope will test               
              some scientific hypothesis derived from the models of Lentz and                
              Trowbridge (1991) and Gawarkiewicz and Chapman (1992) which                    
              identify the dependence of the boundary layer thickness on the                 
              stratification, alongshore flow, and steepness of bottom                       
              topography.
