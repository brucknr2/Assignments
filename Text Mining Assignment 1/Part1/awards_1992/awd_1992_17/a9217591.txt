Abstract    :
              The conference will be a two and one-half day event to                         
              address the progress that has been made in the Central and                     
              Eastern United States toward the reduction of the earthquake                   
              threat.  A key focus will be on future needs for research,                     
              i.e., a research agenda for the remaining decade of the 90s                    
              and beyond.  In advance of the conference, monographs will                     
              be developed addressing the state-of-the-art technology in                     
              five technical areas of hazard assessment, the built                           
              environment and research, preparedness, response and                           
              recovery, and social and economical losses.  In addition,                      
              paper and poster sessions will be held to address individual                   
              works and needs in these five areas, and a set of                              
              proceedings will be published containing approximately 150                     
              papers on the subjects.  The conference will be held in a                      
              manner that emphasizes discussion and interaction among                        
              seismologists, engineers, emergency managers, social                           
              scientists, and planners. The conference will be held in                       
              Memphis, Tennessee on May 2-5, 1993.
