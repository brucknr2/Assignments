Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                                                                                             
                                                                                            
              Organic matter degradation and carbonate dissolution in surficial              
              deep-sea sediments control benthic fluxes to sea water and the                 
              extent of organic carbon and calcium carbonate preservation in the             
              ocean.  These processes are studied using microelectrodes to                   
              measure gradients of conductivity, oxygen and pH across the                    
              sediment-water interface.  A modelling study of certain pH results             
              to date reveals that the rate the in situ of calcite dissolution is            
              pressure-dependent and the rate constant is several orders of                  
              magnitude less than laboratory-determined values.  A recent field              
              comparison between fluxes calculated from microelectrode oxygen and            
              pH data, was not observed in the lander fluxes.  This result                   
              departs from present perceptions about the mechanisms of CaCo3                 
              dissolution on the sea floor, is and will be tested by exploring               
              mechanisms that might explain the discrepancy.  The research will              
              focus on a transect of microelectrode profiles and lander fluxes               
              across the saturation horizon on the Ceara Rise in the eastern                 
              equatorial Atlantic Ocean.  The study is a collaborative experiment            
              with Dr. Richard Jahnke (OCE-9201896) who is carrying out a benthic            
              flux experiment in this area.  Diagenesis mechanisms and the                   
              integrity of pH determinations will be tested by measuring pCO2                
              across the sediment-water interface using a fiber-optic sensor                 
              constructed during the past year.
