Abstract    :
              9217198  Hollibaugh  The autoanalyzer will be used by multiple users in a
              variety  of estuarine research projects, all of which require fine  levels of
              precision and accuracy in nutrient analysis.  Experiments determining how pools
              of nutrients change in  response to different biogeochemical variables form the
               general basis of these projects. Primarily, research on NSF  (OCE 89-14921)
              and USDA (91-37102-6859) projects will  benefit from acquisition of the
              autoanalyzer, through the  examination of nutrients in the water column,
              sediments, and  primary producers of Tomales Bay, California. Additionally, 
              the abilities of the autoanalyzer will be exploited by other  users to measure
              nutrient status and flux in sections of San  Francisco Bay, in tidal wetlands
              of coastal California, and  along the reef tract of the Florida Keys. All of
              these  projects address how nutrients are processed in aquatic  environments,
              ultimately to understand the connections  between human activities and the
              function of estuaries. The  proposed autoanalyzer will contribute greatly to
              this goal  and will be an integral aspect of ongoing research and  education at
              Tiburon Center.
