Abstract    :
              9217413  Giedroc   The collective research interests of the primary 
              investigators concern the study of peptide and protein  structure and molecular
              recognition.  The mode of metal  coordination and overall  structure of two
              gene regulatory  zinc metalloproteins (zinc-finger proteins) which interact 
              with nucleic acids will be determined.  Conformational  studies of bound
              substrates and structural changes which  result in autophosphorylation of the
              tyrosine kinase domain  of the human insulin receptor are proposed to study 
              catalysis by this class of enzymes.  NMR structural studies  of nucleated
              -sheets and model -sandwich proteins are  planned to understand the fundamental
              rules that govern the  formation of -sheet secondary structures in proteins. 
              Finally, structural studies of synthetic conformationally  constrained
              peptidomimetics of bio-active peptides, e.g.,  opiate antagonists and active
              site peptides as candidates  for viral protease inhibitors, are proposed.  The
              request  NMR instrumentation will be a component of the Center for 
              Macromolecular Design of the Institute of Biosciences and  Technology at Texas
              A&M University.  As a major goal of the  Center is the recruitment, support,
              and teaching of  outstanding undergraduate, graduate, and postgraduate 
              students, the proposed instrumentation will be used to  enhance and expand
              their educational experience in the area  of protein structure.
