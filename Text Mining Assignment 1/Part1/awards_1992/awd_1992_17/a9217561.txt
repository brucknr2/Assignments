Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                                                                                            
              This study will use germanium/silicon ratios in marine biogenic                
              silica and accumulation rates of opal in the Southern Ocean to                 
              characterize variations in Antarctic productivity and in the                   
              oceanic silica and germanium cycles over the Pleistocene and Late              
              Neogene.  Over the next year efforts will be directed toward (1)               
              implementing the Ge-hydride generation method on a new ICP-MS, and             
              establishing the capability to analyze small volume and mass                   
              samples of marine waters and particulates (pore waters, trap                   
              samples, radiolaria); (2) running and additional set of diatom                 
              cultures with two dominant Antartic species, including the                     
              "reverse" dissolution experiment to determine the Ge/Si                        
              fractionation factors for both diatom uptake and dissolution; (3)              
              publishing the lingering preprints.
