Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Funds are provided to upgrade the image processing facility used in            
              the 0.9m Spacewatch Telescope of the University of Arizona at Kitt             
              Peak.  Currently, a Solbourne computer is used to analyze images of            
              the sky collected in drift-scan mode by a TK2048 charge-coupled                
              device (CCD) mounted at one of the Newtonian ports of the                      
              telescope.  The system processes the images in near real-time, i.e.            
              at the rate with which the images are collected.  Since September              
              1990, earth-approachers have been found at a rate of approximately             
              1.5 per month, including the first observations of asteroids in the            
              5 to 10 m size range.  It has been found that asteroids smaller                
              than 10 m are more numerous by two orders of magnitude than is                 
              expected by extrapolation from the frequency of larger asteroids.              
              These enhancements to the existing computer system will double the             
              discovery rate.  Results could yield information on the origin of              
              asteroids near the Earth.  Observations made possible by this                  
              upgrade will be a key to establishing the dynamical origin of the              
              smallest asteroids (meteorites) and their physical relation to                 
              comets and asteroids.
