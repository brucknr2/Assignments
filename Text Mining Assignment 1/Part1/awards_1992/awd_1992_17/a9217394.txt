Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The Grand Challenge Application Groups competition provides one                
              mechanism for the support of multidisciplinary teams of engineers              
              and scientists to meet the goals of the High Performance Computing             
              and Communications (HPCC) Initiative in Fiscal Year 1992.  The                 
              ideal proposal provides not only excellence in basic research:                 
              focussed problem with potential for substantial impact in critical             
              area(s) of science and engineering, but also significant                       
              interactions between the various disciplinary and computational                
              activities involving mathematical, computer or computational                   
              scientists, that would have an impact in high performance                      
              computational activity beyond the specific problem area(s) or                  
              discipline being studied.  These are the goals of this project                 
              which is a collaboration between applied mathematics, astrophysics,            
              computer and computational science, engineering, geophysical                   
              sciences, to develop parallel algorithms for problems relating to              
              Coupled Fields and Coherent Structures and Geophysical and                     
              Astrophysical Fluid Dynamics (GAFD) Turbulence.  The common                    
              denominator of the various application areas are performance                   
              measures, massive data sets, and the visualization of multi-                   
              terabyte data sets.  In addition to the expertise at the University            
              of Colorado at Boulder, scientists at the National Center for                  
              Atmospheric Research (NCAR) will contribute to geostrophic                     
              turbulence and ocean convection research, and a sub-contract will              
              be given to the scientists at the University of Minnesota who will             
              contribute expertise in both astrophysics and visualization.
