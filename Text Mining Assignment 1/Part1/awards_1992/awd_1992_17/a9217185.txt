Abstract    :
              The need for high quality, directed research on hyperbase systems              
              (hypermedia database systems) has become very apparent to                      
              researchers in many fields.  This workshop brings together                     
              approximately 25 participants from the areas of hypermedia,                    
              database, collaborative and information retrieval systems for an               
              intensive two-day workshop, held in Washington, D.C. in October                
              1992. The workshop has two primary goals.  The first goal is to                
              bring synergy to the hyperbase system research area through                    
              understanding and building of research relationships in this                   
              diverse and multidisciplinary group.  The second goal is to                    
              establish an agenda for research in this critical area of next-                
              generation information systems.  The result of the workshop is a               
              report identifying: critical research issues facing hyperbase                  
              system researchers, current progress on the issues, potential                  
              methods of approach (including literature citations) and a                     
              general research agenda for the field.  The results will be                    
              widely disseminated in the refereed and professional society                   
              literature and through the appropriate conferences.
