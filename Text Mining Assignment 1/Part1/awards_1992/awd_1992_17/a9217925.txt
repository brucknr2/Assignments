Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This award supports the participation of 11 U.S. scientists in a               
              U.S.-Japan Seminar on Molecular and Cellular Aspects of Vascular               
              Smooth Muscle Function, to be held in Hawaii, Feb. 1-4, 1994.                  
              The co-organizers are Professor R. Clinton Webb of the University              
              of Michigan and Professor Yoshiaki Nonomura of the University of               
              Tokyo.  This seminar builds upon the success of two similar                    
              bilateral meetings held in 1977 and 1989.  In addition to the                  
              U.S. and Japanese participants, scientists will be invited from                
              Germany, Belgium, Sweden, Denmark, and Russia.                                 
                                                                                             
              This seminar will bring together specialists in the four                       
              processes in the contraction and relaxation of vascular smooth                 
              muscle:  1) membrane excitation, 2) excitation-contraction                     
              coupling, 3) energy metabolism, and 4) chemomechanical                         
              transduction.  Although these are the same processes that are                  
              involved in the function of other muscle, there are important                  
              individualities among the various muscle types and there is a                  
              high degree of specialization among the investigators.  Since the              
              earlier two meetings on the subject, important new insight has                 
              been developed in basic research in vascular biology.                          
              Participants in this seminar will exchange information and plan                
              directions for future research.
