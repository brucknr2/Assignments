Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation Program            
              will assist the Department of Chemistry at the University of                   
              Wisconsin-Eau Claire in the purchase of a 300 MHz Fourier Transform            
              Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (FT-NMR) spectrometer.  Several new                 
              faculty members whose research is dependent upon high-field NMR                
              will benefit from the acquisition of this instrument.  It will open            
              new opportunities for undergraduates in research that is now                   
              difficult to carry out without such an instrument.  Research                   
              projects to be carried out with this instrument include: (1) the               
              synthesis of tricyclic cyclopropenes, (2) hydrogen exchange studies            
              of proteins, (3) chirality transfer in dioxinones, (4) synthesis of            
              polythiaethers, (5) electron transfer reactions, (6) pH gradients              
              across membrane vesicles, and (7) phase chances in microemulsions.

                   This proposal will assist in the purchase of a modern nuclear             
              magnetic resonance (NMR) spectrometer.  This instrument is an                  
              essential tool for faculty members at the University of Wisconsin-             
              Eau Claire engaged in chemical research.  The instrument provides              
              important information which in most cases can be used to determine             
              the geometric and/or molecular structure of newly synthesized                  
              molecules.
