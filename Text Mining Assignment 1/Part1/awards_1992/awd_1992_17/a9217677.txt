Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              These funds support a three year effort to develop low-noise                   
              cryogenic transistor amplifiers for use in millimeter wavelength               
              radio astronomy.  Transistor amplifiers offer a number of                      
              significant advantages for radio astronomical systems, including               
              very low (Tn < 65 K SSB) noise, large (10 - 20 GHz) instantaneous              
              bandwidth, single sideband system operation without input filters,             
              and good stability.  There are additional virtues of particular                
              importance for focal plane array systems.  Such systems are                    
              relatively non-critical in terms of operating temperature and other            
              conditions and they are well-adapted to reproduction in the                    
              quantities required for arrays.  No mechanical adjustments are                 
              required for optimum performance.  Projections for the performance             
              of HEMT amplifiers in the 3 mm band are receiver noise temperatures            
              below 65 K (single sideband), which should yield atmospheric-                  
              limited performance at most frequencies.  The large bandwidth will             
              facilitate searches for multiple spectral lines over a large                   
              frequency range as well as for emission from galaxies having                   
              unknown velocities.  Presently available devices offer extremely               
              low noise performance in the 40 - 50 GHz range, which is where                 
              initial efforts will be directed.  Within two years, devices with              
              comparable performance in the 3 mm wavelength range should be                  
              obtainable.
