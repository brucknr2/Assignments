Abstract    :
              Professor Jerome Percus is supported by a grant from the                       
              Theoretical and Computational Chemistry Program to perform                     
              theoretical studies in five specific areas including: 1)                       
              equilibrium theory of classical continuum fluids, simple and                   
              complex; 2) the corresponding theory of lattice gasses on                      
              networks of varying complexity; 3) electron fluids, atomic                     
              and molecular, principally at zero temperature; 4) the                         
              nonequilibrium theory of random sequential adsorption; and                     
              5) stationary clock-regulated queuing networks.  A common                      
              thread starting to appear in these diverse fields of                           
              research is that of hierarchical structure, calling for a                      
              multi-level description and strongly influencing the                           
              framework in which more empirical studies will be made.                        
              %%%                                                                            
              Complex systems consisting of strongly interacting molecules                   
              in condensed phases are still not well understood from a                       
              theoretical point of view.  Much of the current line of                        
              research consists of theories based on simplified models                       
              which capture the salient features of the more complex                         
              systems they represent.  Percus' research on such models                       
              will help to elucidate the important physical                                  
              characteristics of such complex systems.
