Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The primary objective of this project is to allow the production of            
              high definition molds and casts of a series of important fossil                
              hominids from the Upper Pleistocene of France.  These fossils are              
              currently at the University of Bordeaux but will soon be dispersed             
              to other facilities at which point they will no longer be available            
              for casting.  Hence, this is an urgent project.  The casts will be             
              become part of the Fossil Pattern Repository and will be available             
              for examination by scholars.
