Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This project is an investigation of the Lagrangian displacement of             
              water masses in the deep equatorial Atlantic Ocean using both                  
              analytical and numerical approaches.  Two numerical models are                 
              used: a reduced gravity shallow water model, and the GDFL ocean                
              general circulation model.  The main scientific goals are (1)                  
              identification of dominant mechanisms for generating wave                      
              transients and how can these transients affect Lagrangian                      
              displacement of water masses and, (2) analysis of effects of bottom            
              topography and shoreline geometry on the Lagrangian equatorial                 
              transport.
