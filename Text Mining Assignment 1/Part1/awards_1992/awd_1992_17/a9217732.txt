Abstract    :
              An exploratory study will be carried out to study the efficacy                 
              of a high velocity mixture of a volatile liquid and a non-                     
              condensable gas in cooling high flux electronics applications.                 
              Preliminary studies at Cray computer Corporation suggest that                  
              such a system could attain a 5- to 10-fold enhancement of                      
              volumetric heat removal rate. The task will include (1)                        
              construction of a high heat flux narrow channel to simulate                    
              high-density electronics packaging; (2) determination of heat                  
              transfer coefficients and pressure drops for a mixed flow of                   
              nitrogen and perfluorinated liquid (FC-72) through the                         
              channel; (3) development of a first order mathematical model                   
              suitable for extrapolating the experimental results to other                   
              configurations of interest.
