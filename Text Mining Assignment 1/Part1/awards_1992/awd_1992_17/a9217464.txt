Abstract    :
              9217464  Kirtman  This U.S.-Brazil Cooperative Science award will support the 
              collaboration of Bernard Kirtman of the University of California  at Santa
              Barbara and Celso de Melo of the Federal University of  Pernambuco, Brazil. 
              The project aims to investigate the  nonlinear optical properties of conjugated
              polymers.    The researchers will formulate theoretical methods that permit an 
              accurate, comprehensive description of these properties, which  include
              distortion due to coupling of vibrations with electronic  polarization induced
              by the oscillatory incident field(s);  electron correlation; and non-resonant
              frequency dispersion.  Ab  initio quantum chemistry calculations of all three
              effects will  be done for the prototype pi-conjugated polymer, trans- 
              polyacetylene using the finite oligomer approach.  A transfer  matrix method
              for circumventing the extrapolations required with  this procedure will also be
              investigated.  Both the U.S. and  Brazilian sides will gain an understanding of
              the interaction  between high intensity optical radiation and conjugated
              polymers,  which could potentially improve the design of polymeric materials 
              for practical purposes.  Students and postdocs on both sides will  benefit from
              training in non-conventional polymer methodologies.    ***
