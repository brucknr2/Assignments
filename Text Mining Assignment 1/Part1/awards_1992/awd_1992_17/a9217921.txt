Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This proposal asks for support to conduct a high-resolution seismic            
              reflection/refraction survey of high-sedimentation-rate drift areas            
              in the North Atlantic south of Iceland.  This work will elucidate              
              the paleoceanography of this high-latitude, sub-polar region in                
              times prior to the most recent Northern Hemisphere deglaciation,               
              and assist in identifying drilling targets.  Seismic                           
              characterization of drift deposits will allow the recovery of high             
              deposition rate sediments (likely 3-10 cm/kiloyear) that hold the              
              key to analysis and interpretation of sub-orbital global change                
              events.  Recent stratigraphic analyses from existing sediment and              
              ice cores show that such events can have extremely abrupt onsets.              
              Proposed work is relevant to the Ocean Drilling Program:  drilling             
              proposals (s) to sample North Atlantic sediment drifts have been               
              high-ranked by scientists working within the "thematic panel"
