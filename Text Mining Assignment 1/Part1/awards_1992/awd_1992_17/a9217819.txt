Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This award supports a two-year cooperative research project                    
              between Professor John Hildebrand, Scripps Institution of                      
              Oceanography, University of California, San Diego, and Professor               
              Junzo Kasahara, Earthquake Research Institute, University of                   
              Tokyo.  The project involves placing seismic stations in island                
              sites along the Mariana, Yap and Palau Trench regions of the                   
              western Pacific, in coordination with a program for long-term                  
              instrumenting abandoned telecommunications cables in the western               
              Pacific with seismic and magnetic sensors.  A graduate student                 
              from UC San Diego will conduct research at the University of                   
              Tokyo as part of this project.                                                 
                                                                                             
              The oceanic deep-sea trenches of the western Pacific are the                   
              result of large-scale subduction of oceanic crust in this region.              
              Associated with subduction is the generation of high levels of                 
              seismicity along dipping Benioff zones on the landward side of                 
              the oceanic trenches.  The large magnitude earthquakes generated               
              at western Pacific subduction zones has been extensively studies               
              using the Global Seismic Network, providing a detailed mapping of              
              the configuration and characteristics of the seismogenic zone.                 
              Smaller magnitude earthquakes require regional seismic networks                
              for study.  This has particularly been accomplished on the                     
              Japanese Islands where an exensive regional netowrk of seismic                 
              stations are positioned above the seismogenic zone.  Other                     
              subduction zone regions of the western Pacific have fewer island               
              sites available for placement of seismic stations, yet these                   
              areas are important to gain a complete picture of the seismicity               
              and tectonic behavior of the western Pacific.
