Abstract    :
                   The proposed project deals with kinetic-MHD theory of low                 
              frequency instabilities and satellite data analysis of particle and            
              wave to understand the excitation mechanisms of internally excited             
              ultra low frequency (ULF) magnetic pulsations observed in the                  
              magnetosphere. The studies will provide important theoretical basis            
              and techniques for computing new stability parameters from                     
              satellite particle data associated with ULF magnetic pulsations                
              observed in the magnetosphere. Transverse waves are probably driven            
              unstable by releasing free energy associated with oxygen ion                   
              velocity space bump-on-tail distribution or its pressure gradient              
              via wave-particle resonances. Preliminary research results have                
              revealed many new and important features of the physics of ULF                 
              waves and the related plasma properties.
