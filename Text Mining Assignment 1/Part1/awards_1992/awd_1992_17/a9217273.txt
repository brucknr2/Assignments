Abstract    :
              The aim of this project is to develop theoretical models that                  
              provide new understanding of the handoff problem in cellular                   
              communications networks. The performance of handoff algorithms in              
              different propagation environments will be analyzed in terms of the            
              tradeoff between unnecessary handoffs and handoff delay.                       
              Procedures for choosing parameters for existing algorithms will be             
              developed.  New optimal algorithms will be derived using the                   
              analytic models.  Handoff algorithms will be analyzed using level              
              crossing theory, an approach that has yielded promising preliminary            
              results. Results from propagation analysis will be used to study               
              the effect of radio channel characteristics on the handoff                     
              procedure.  The design of optimal algorithms will involve the use              
              of sequential decision making, and control and estimation theory.              
              This project aims for fundamental theoretical results regarding the            
              performance of handoff algorithms.
