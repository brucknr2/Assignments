Abstract    :
                    Logical errors in sequential circuit designs and  communication protocols
              have always been an important  problem. They can delay getting a new product on
              the market  or cause the failure of some critical device that is already  in
              use. The most widely used method for verifying such  systems is based on
              extensive simulation and can easily miss  significant errors when the number of
              possible states is  very large.  This research deals with developing an
              alternative approach  based on a technique called temporal logic model
              checking.  In this approach specifications are expressed in a  propositional
              temporal logic, and sequential circuits and  communication protocols are
              modeled as state transition  systems.  An efficient search procedure is used to
              determine  automatically if the specifications are satisfied by the  transition
              system.  The technique has been used in the past  to find subtle errors in a
              number of non-trivial designs.
