Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The study will attempt to answer the question whether planktonic               
              foraminaferal productivity and isotopic composition accurately                 
              record seasonal variations of surface water temperatures.  Stable              
              isotopic analyses will be performed on planktonic foraminafera                 
              samples collected earlier and the PI will continue sediment                    
              trapping for additional annual cycle by deploying sediment traps in            
              the equatorial Atlantic on other funded cruises of opportunity.
