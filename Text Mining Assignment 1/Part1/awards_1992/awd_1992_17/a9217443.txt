Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Organic syntheses are often carried out in organic solvents,                   
              some of which are toxic, hazardous, or environmentally                         
              troublesome.  The choice of a solvent for a homogeneous                        
              synthesis reaction is often limited by the multiple functions                  
              required of the solvent.  Two of the more important functions                  
              are: (1) solubilization of the reactants, reaction                             
              intermediates, and catalyst, and (2) rate or selectivity                       
              enhancement through the participation of the solvent as a base                 
              or as a catalyst ligand.  In the aerobic coupling of 2,6-                      
              dimethylphenol, which is the basis of the commercial                           
              production of poly(2,6-dimethyl-1,4-phenylene oxide) (PPO),                    
              pyridine and nitrobenzene are often used as the reaction media                 
              because of their high solubilities for dimethylphenol, PPO,                    
              and cuprous chloride (the coupling catalyst).  But solvents                    
              such as pyridine and nitrobenzene are highly toxic and                         
              noxious.  Their use presents health, safety and environmental                  
              concerns and alternate solvents and technology need to be                      
              explored.                                                                      
                                                                                             
              The objective of this research is to develop oil-water                         
              interfacial synthesis as a benign alternative to conventional                  
              syntheses that require the use of toxic solvents.  This                        
              technique involves a combination of innocuous oil and aqueous                  
              phases in place of the toxic organic solvent.  The multiple                    
              functions which previously limited the choice of solvent are                   
              here decoupled and are met separately by a biphasic mixture.                   
              The desired reaction is effected at the oil-water interface by                 
              means of a surface-active complex and by pH control of the                     
              aqueous phase.  This project will further develop the                          
              interfacial technique so that it may be (1) optimized and                      
              adopted for commercial PPO synthesis and (2) extended to other                 
              synthesis reactions that have commercial potential.  The                       
              research will receive intellectual input and possible long-
