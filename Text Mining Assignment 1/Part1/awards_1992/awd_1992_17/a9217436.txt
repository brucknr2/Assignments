Abstract    :
                    9217436  Zahorian    This is the second year funding of a two year
              continuing award.   This project investigates the use of the binary-pair
              partitioning  (BPP) method, which partitions an N-way classification task with 
              N*(N-1)/2 pair-discrimination classifiers, in the problem of  speaker and
              dialect identification.  The complexity of the BPP  networks grows with N2 and
              the method, which has been examined in  a preliminary way for speaker
              identification, is well suited for  cases where the talker identification task
              involves a large number  of speakers (N>100).  The preliminary studies of
              speaker  identification with the BPP method involved 100 male speakers 
              belonging to three dialect regions of the DARPA/TIMIT database.   The system
              performed with 100% accuracy in a text independent than  results reported in
              the literature for similar tasks.  The BPP  approach is also suited for tasks
              where multiple elemental  decisions can be combined to obtain an overall
              decision, such as  dialect or language identification.  Refinements and
              extensions to  the method will be investigated, such as (1) enhancement of the 
              input features, (2) the effects of noise and channel distortion on 
              performance, (3) performance in a speaker verification mode as well  as in an
              identification mode, (4) performance in sex and dialect  identification, (5)
              improvements that this method may provide for  speech recognition, and (6)
              training of BPP networks to minimize  the probability of error rather than the
              mean square error.
