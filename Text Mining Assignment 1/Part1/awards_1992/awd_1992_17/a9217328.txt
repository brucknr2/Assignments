Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This award supports a two-year collaborative research project                  
              between Professor Eugene C. Loh of the University of Utah and                  
              Professor Motohiko Nagano of the University of Tokyo.  Together                
              the investigators will attempt to develop a very high resolution               
              camera that can be used as the light signal detector in a high                 
              energy cosmic ray detector and perform a number of studies                     
              related to the design of a very large cosmic ray detector.                     
                                                                                             
              The Japanese group under the direction of Professor Nagano                     
              operates the world's largest surface detectors, called AGASA,                  
              designed to detect electrons, muons, and gamma rays.  The U.S.                 
              group operates the world's only nitrogen scintillation detector                
              called the Fly's Eye Detector.  Topics of mutual interest to the               
              two groups include measurements of the cosmic ray energy                       
              spectrum, chemical composition, and anisotropy.  The common goal               
              is to discover where and how these extremely energetic particles               
              are accelerated.  The search for point sources of neutral                      
              particles is a high priority for both groups.  In addition to the              
              principal investigator, five other scientists and technicians                  
              specializing in electronics, calibration, analysis, and computer               
              modelling will participate in the project.
