Abstract    :
              Identification  of  the dominant mechanism of magma  genesis  for              
              volcanic rocks in the Central Volcanic Zone of the South American              
              Andes  is important in understanding the evolution of magmas  and              
              in  addressing the broader issues of arc magmatism  and  chemical              
              geodynamics  of  the  crust and mantle.  Investigators  who  have              
              studied andesitic and dacitic stratocones of the Andes have  been              
              hampered  by  an inability to constrain the most primitive  magma              
              compositions.   The research outlined in this  proposal  is  more              
              likely  to  yield critical information regarding  the  nature  of              
              parental  magmas in the central Andes as it involves a  study  of              
              lavas  from  minor volcanic centers that exhibit  more  primitive              
              characteristics.    The   project  will   involve   field   work,              
              petrographic  and  mineral chemical analyses,  and  isotopic  and              
              trace   element  geochemical  analyses.   A  careful   microprobe              
              investigation  of xenolith- and xenocryst-relationships  is  also              
              planned.
