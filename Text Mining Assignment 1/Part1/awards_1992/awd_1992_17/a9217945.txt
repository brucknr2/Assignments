Abstract    :
                   This award will provide 77% of the cost of acquiring an X-                
              ray fluorescence spectrometer (XRF) system to be installed and                 
              operated in the Department of Geosciences at Franklin and Marshall             
              College. F&M College is committed to providing the remaining funds             
              needed for the acquisition.                                                    
                   Faculty and undergraduate students at F&M engage in active                
              research projects in the area of igneous, metamorphic, sedimentary,            
              and coal petrology, as well as geochemistry. The multi-element                 
              chemical analysis of geologic samples provided by this equipment               
              will allow several research projects to proceed with modern                    
              instrumentation. Instruction and use of the XRF spectrometer will              
              also be incorporated in several laboratory undergraduate courses.
