Abstract    :
              This project proposes the construction of a powerful,                          
              variable-field nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectrometer                   
              (range from 0 to 2 Tesla) for the investigation of                             
              relaxation and molecular dynamics in a broad range of                          
              materials, including liquid crystals, phospholipid                             
              membranes, and polymers, as well as bonding structure in                       
              bioinorganic compounds. Field-cycling NMR (FC-NMR) is an                       
              innovative and rather new technique and such FC-NMR                            
              spectrometers are not commercially available. The major                        
              application of the FC-NMR spectrometer will be to obtain                       
              novel information on the relaxation properties of IH, 2H,                      
              l9F, and 31P nuclei in the solid and liquid-crystalline                        
              states of various materials at low to         intermediate                     
              magnetic fields strengths (0 to 2 Tesla), where measurements                   
              using standard NMR methods are difficult or impossible. The                    
              relaxation mechanisms will yield new information regarding                     
              the dynamics of the molecules in the various materials to be                   
              studied. Knowledge of the relaxation in the low magnetic                       
              field (low frequency) region is essential to obtain any                        
              comprehensive understanding of the molecular properties in                     
              solids, liquid crystals, and membranes. The FC-NMR                             
              spectrometer will also be used to obtain information                           
              regarding the charge distribution around quadrupolar nuclei,                   
              such as 2H, 14N, 17O, and 59Co in bioinorganic substances,                     
              which is essential to achieve a detailed understanding of                      
              their reaction chemistry and their role in enzyme                              
              mechanisms.
