Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              In this project the P.I. will analyze existing samples from Legs 28            
              and 29 of DSDP from the Indian ocean.  The data will be used to (a)            
              evaluate the extent of variation of isotopic composition of the                
              Indian ocean MOR mantle, and (b) determine whether Pacific mantle              
              has migrated westward through time and, if so, at what rate.
