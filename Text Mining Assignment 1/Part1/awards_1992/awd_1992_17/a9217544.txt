Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This award supports the participation of 15 U.S. scientists in a               
              U.S.-Japan Seminar on Stochastic Analysis on Infinite Dimensional              
              Spaces, to be held January 4-8, 1994 in Baton Rouge, Louisiana.                
              The co-organizers are Professor Hui Hsiung Kuo, Louisiana State                
              University, and Professor Hiroshi Kunita, Kyushu University,                   
              Fukuoka, Japan.  The objective of the seminar is to exchange                   
              information on stochastic analysis related to Lie groups,                      
              stochastic partial differential equations, stochastic flows and                
              analysis on Wiener functionals, large deviation, white noise                   
              calculus, and stable laws.                                                     
                                                                                             
              Both the United States and Japan have leading scientific                       
              researchers in the field of stochastic analysis on infinite                    
              dimensional spaces.  The field has been growing rapidly during the             
              last two decades because of its diversified applications and                   
              mathematical theory.  The time is right for researchers from both              
              countries to have in-depth discussions on the state of the art in              
              this field.
