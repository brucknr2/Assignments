Abstract    :
              This project seeks support to quantify and codify measurements of              
              structural, igneous, and metamorphic/alteration features observed              
              in core materials and logs of Ocean Drilling Program Hole 504B.  At            
              just over 2 kilometers sub-seafloor depth, 504B is the deepest                 
              borehole in ocean crust, and the only one that samples the pillow              
              basalt/sheeted dike transition.   This borehole has been                       
              successfully deepened through six (6) DSDP and ODP legs.  PI began             
              the task of detailed description of structural and petrologic                  
              features on the most recent, Leg 140.  His initial work shows that             
              significant trends and/or cycles in such features as vein abundance            
              and secondary minerals may exist.  PI now wishes to extend this                
              work through examination and description of core materials from the            
              previous five (5) drilling legs.  The goals of this research are to            
              provide a standard and more detailed descriptive log of this                   
              important ocean crustal reference section, and to determine what               
              overall trends and cycles in structural and petrologic features                
              exist down hole.  This information, in turn, will provide insights             
              to processes of ocean crust formation, as well as processes of                 
              secondary hydrothermal alteration of ocean crust.
