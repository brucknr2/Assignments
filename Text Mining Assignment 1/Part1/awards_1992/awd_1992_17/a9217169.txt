Abstract    :
              This research employs on a novel time-resolved spectroscopy for                
              specular thin films and surfaces based on ellipsometry.  Rapidly               
              evolving thin films and surfaces can be characterized in real time             
              with sub-monolayer sensitivity and resolution.  The technique                  
              differs from alternative methods because of its speed, it requires             
              no in vacuo instrumentation, it operates passively during                      
              deposition, and it can probe surfaces even in the most adverse                 
              environments such as chemical vapor deposition.  The technique is              
              being applied to a number of growth processes in group IV                      
              semiconductors.                                                                
              %%%                                                                            
              This project continues the development and application of a                    
              technique to measure the deposition of atomic layers.  The                     
              technique is unique in that it measures the growth atomic layer by             
              atomic layer.  In addition, it is very fast and robust and can be              
              used to monitor growth of semiconductor layers in the chambers that            
              are used commercially.  The technique is based on reflection of                
              light from the surface that is growing.  The technique is being                
              applied to a number of materials, primarily semiconductors.
