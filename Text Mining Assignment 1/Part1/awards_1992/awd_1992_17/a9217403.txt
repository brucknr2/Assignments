Abstract    :
              This proposal is for the purchase of a fluorescence-                           
              activated cell sorter to replace one purchased in 1983 at                      
              the inception of the Center for Fluorescence Research in                       
              Biomedical Sciences at Carnegie Mellon University.  The PI                     
              and co-PI are leaders in the flow cytometry community and                      
              the current FACS has been used in 38 research publications                     
              in cell biology in the 9 years since its installation.  No                     
              other instrument exists at CMU.  Limitations in its                            
              capabilities compared to newer instruments and difficulties                    
              with repairing and maintaining it justify replacement.  The                    
              group of major and minor users receives over $3,290,000 in                     
              direct cost research support  per year from federal and                        
              other agencies, including over $690,000 per year from NSF.                     
              The proposal replacement instrument will be used for                           
              research in a number of areas of cell, molecular and                           
              developmental biology, including membrane traffic, somatic                     
              cell genetics, fluorescent probe development, mitochondria                     
              physiology and cell differentiation and will be an integral                    
              part of the recently-established NSF Science and Technology                    
              Research Center in Light Microscopy Imaging and
