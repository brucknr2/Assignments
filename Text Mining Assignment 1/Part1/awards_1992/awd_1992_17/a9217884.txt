Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Through this activity the American Physical                                    
              Society (APS) will expand its existing efforts                                 
              to assist in the development of physics                                        
              infrastructure and to aid young physicists in                                  
              the former Soviet Union (FSU).  The APS will                                   
              support regional summer schools, seminars and                                  
              workshops; supplement the APS journal                                          
              distribution program to restore library                                        
              subscriptions to key FSU research institutions;                                
              and assist in the development of peer review                                   
              systems in the FSU.  The APS Task Force, which                                 
              is coordinating current Society initiatives in                                 
              this area with support through donations from                                  
              the APS membership and a matching Sloan                                        
              Foundation grant, will provide oversight for                                   
              this program.  The Task Force obtains advice                                   
              from committees it has organized in Russia and                                 
              Ukraine, from a committee of expatriate FSU                                    
              scholars resident in the U.S., and from the                                    
              various Divisions of the Society.  The                                         
              activities will be pursued in close cooperation                                
              with the European Physical Society.
