Abstract    :
              The University of Hawaii, Institute of Geophysics will continue                
              development, construction and testing of FOCUS (Fiber-Optic                    
              Communication Undersea System).   FOCUS is designed to be a                    
              relatively small, lightweight, fiber-optically tethered real-time              
              video camera system offering maneuverability and deep sea                      
              capabilities at a low unit cost.  It will provide ocean scientists             
              with high resolution, real-time digital color video in depths to               
              6,000 meters.  Its size, weight, and modular construction will make            
              FOCUS usable from ships of opportunity, and those without a complex            
              over-the-side support system.  The key to FOCUS' relatively small              
              size is a new electro-optic cable.  The phase 2 effort will consist            
              of deep water field testing and addition of a passive, low-cost                
              'eyeball' that will hang below the main FOCUS frame.   The                     
              University is providing sharing.  A variety of geological and                  
              geophysical studies of the seafloor can make use of cost-effective             
              capabilities provided by a vehicle such as FOCUS.
