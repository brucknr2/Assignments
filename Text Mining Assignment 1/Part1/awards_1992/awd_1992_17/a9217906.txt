Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Astrometric Research at the Yale University Observatory.                       
                                                                                             
              Dr. Van Altena will continue a wide range of current and planned               
              long term astrometric research based at Yale University.  This                 
              award will provide some support for the reduction of data from the             
              Southern Proper Motion Survey, but the principal objective is to               
              support those operations that are closely related to the PI's                  
              facilities in New Haven, CT.  Dr. Van Altena plans to produce a                
              catalog of Right Ascensions and Declinations for faint stars seen              
              from the Southern Hemisphere for use with large telescopes in                  
              determining positions of faint extra-galactic objects and                      
              positioning fiber optic probes for spectrographs.  Work will                   
              continue on the determination of parallaxes of selected stars of               
              astrophysical interest and on determination of reliable proper                 
              motion memberships in stellar clusters.
