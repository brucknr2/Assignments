Abstract    :
                   This research project will study trophic relations in benthic             
              microbial food webs.  The objectives are: (1) to estimate the rates            
              of bactivory and herbivory of benthic nanoflagellates, ciliates,               
              nematodes, copepods, and other organisms in tidal-flat communities;            
              (2) to compare the trophic structures of several distinct types of             
              intertidal microbial communities inhabiting exposed sandy,                     
              protected sandy and muddy beaches; and (3) to examine changes in               
              the trophic structure of the benthic microbial community in course             
              of seasonal succession.  These objectives will be conducted through            
              field grazing experiments using fluorescent-labeled bacteria and               
              diatoms as food tracers.  This approach has been used previously to            
              study planktonic protozoan grazing and it will be adapted here for             
              studying benthic metazoans.  A part of this novel experimental                 
              design has been already tested in the field.  The advantage of this            
              experimental design is that it allows simultaneous measurements of             
              microbenthic bactivory and meiobenthic herbivory.  These data are              
              needed to analyze the energy flow through benthic communities, to              
              evaluate the role of grazing in controlling bacterial and algal                
              production and to examine food competition among protozoans and                
              meiofauna.  This research will describe a unique data set that is              
              currently unavailable for any benthic community.
