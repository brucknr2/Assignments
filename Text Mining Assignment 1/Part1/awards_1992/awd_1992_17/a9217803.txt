Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Uncertainty in modeling the response of Eath environments to                   
              changing conditions such as global warming arises from a poor                  
              understanding of the dynamics of these environments.  It is                    
              established that over the past 20,000 years the Sahara has                     
              undergone dramatic swings from more extensive and sand-sea                     
              devlopment than today to being vegetated with common lakes and                 
              rivers.  While   these swings correspond to Milankovitch cycles,               
              our basis for understanding these in a process-reponse model has               
              only recently begun to emerge.  The area of the Sahara extending               
              from the Atlas Mountains onto the Sahara  Platform in Tunisia                  
              offers a microcosm of diverse environments, where deposits are                 
              housed in a subsiding trough.  Remote sensing is first used to map             
              present environments, recognize relict features, and locate                    
              specific depocenters for detailed field work.  Field work involves             
              the establishment of an unconformity-bounded stratigraphic                     
              framework for eolian, fluvial and lacustrine deposits in the area              
              through field mapping of soil-geomorphic and stratigraphic                     
              relationships, facies analysis, and geophysical methods.                       
              Subsequent lab analysis involves the dating of the sequences so                
              they can be correlated with climatic events.  Because the response             
              of eolian and associated depositional systems to climatic and other            
              factors is the basis for sequence stratigraphy, the results are                
              expected to help formulate a general process-response eolian                   
              sequence  model that will have predictive capabilities with respect            
              to changing external controls.
