Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This award is an emergency grant to preserve some valuable                     
              research equipment consisting of vehicles and camping supplies by              
              moving them out of harm's way (warfare in the region and a                     
              breakdown of civil authority) in Zaire to Uganda, where they will              
              be preserved for future research.  The research that will be done              
              in the future involves looking for fossil evidence of human                    
              evolution in the area.
