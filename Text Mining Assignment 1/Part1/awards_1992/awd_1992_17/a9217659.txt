Abstract    :
                   This award supports a conference on Design Theory, Coding                 
              Theory, and Cryptography, which is to be organized by Professor                
              Lindner, at Auburn University.   The combinatorics group at                    
              Auburn has been an extremely active group.  This meeting will                  
              bring together experts from all over the world.  The organizers                
              will make a concerted effort to bring in minority graduate                     
              students to the conference.  The participation of these graduate               
              students will enhance their abilities to participate more fully                
              in mathematical research.                                                      
                   The research is in the general area of combinatorics.                     
              Combinatorics attempts to find efficient methods to study how                  
              discrete collections can be organized.  The behavior of discrete               
              systems is extremely important to modern communications.  For                  
              example, the design of large networks, as in telephone systems,                
              and the design of algorithms in computer science all deal with                 
              discrete objects, and this makes use of combinatorial research.
