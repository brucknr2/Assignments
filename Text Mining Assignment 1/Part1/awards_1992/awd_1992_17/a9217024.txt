Abstract    :
              This grant supports the continued operation, and analysis of the               
              data produced by, induction magnetometers at South Pole and McMurdo            
              Stations in Antarctica and Sondre Stromfjord, Greenland.  These                
              high geomagnetic latitude sites are ideally suited for the study of            
              plasm physics processes which occur near the boundary of the                   
              Earth's magnetosphere, at the poleward edge of the auroral oval and            
              in the polar cap.  The data from this three station network, plus              
              data from additional new magnetometers operated by the same group              
              but supported by other programs, will make possible research which             
              almost certainly will result in new insight into the various                   
              phenomena which produce magnetic micropulsations.
