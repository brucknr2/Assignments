Abstract    :
              It is now possible to detect and study radio emission from the                 
              coronae of stars by using the improved sensitivity of the VLA.  The            
              PI is exploiting this capability to survey a variety of stars which            
              are known or expected to have coronae.  These include weak-lined T             
              Tau stars, dMe flare stars, RS CVn binaries, stars in the . Persei             
              cluster, the rapidly rotating K dwarf AB Dor, etc.  The goal is to             
              understand the structure and underlying physical processes of the              
              coronae.
