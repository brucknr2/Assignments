Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  This project studies small clusters composed a few to dozens              
              of atoms.  The clusters are formed in the gas phase at very low                
              temperatures -- otherwise they would fall apart.  The research                 
              sheds light on the mechanisms by which individual atoms                        
              (particularly helium and neon) attack one another and form larger              
              masses leading to the bulk phase.  The research also looks at                  
              electrically charged clusters and their properties, which also                 
              provide information about the build up of materials firm atoms or              
              clusters.
