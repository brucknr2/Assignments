Abstract    :
              This project, in the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program,                 
              will develop new methods for the synthesis of novel supra-                     
              molecular systems.  In particular, well-ordered and chemically                 
              robust surface multilayer films based on structurally charact-                 
              erized lamellar inorganic compounds will be synthesized.                       
              Layered metal phosphates and phosphonates will be synthesized                  
              from precursors capable of Watson-Crick base pairing and other                 
              multipoint cooperative hydrogen bonding interactions.                          
              Multilayer thin films based on Hoffmann clathrate structures                   
              will also be prepared and the structure, host-guest chemistry,                 
              electrochemistry, and optical properties of the films will be                  
              investigated.

              This project involves the development of new techniques for                    
              growing complex, multilayer structures (films) based on                        
              lamellar inorganic compounds.  These techniques are inteneded                  
              to add to an emerging "nanofabrication" technology which                       
              depends upon wet-chemical methods rather than ultrahigh vacuum                 
              deposition.  This may ultimately lead to the successful                        
              preparation of molecular-scale electronic, optical, and other                  
              type devices.
