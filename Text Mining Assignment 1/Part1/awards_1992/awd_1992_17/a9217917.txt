Abstract    :
                   The  proposed research project will concentrate on four                   
              areas relating to minimal surfaces of finite type.                             
                   The first area will involve the development of                            
              algorithms to calculate integral periods that arise in the                     
              Weierstrass representation of minimal surfaces.                                
              Determination of these periods is critical in insuring that                    
              finite type minimal surfaces are well-defined.                                 
                   The second area of study will be to analyze which                         
              finite type minimal surfaces are embedded in Euclidean three-                  
              space.  Work already completed by the proposer in analyzing                    
              Hoffman-Meeks-Costa surfaces will be expanded upon and the                     
              proposer and student research assistants will study the                        
              relationship between finite type minimal surfaces and the                      
              algebraic curves that generate them.                                           
                    A third research component will be the expansion of                      
              the proposer's Mathematical package "Finite Type."  This                       
              package will facilitate the general study of finite type                       
              minimal surfaces.                                                              
                   Finally,  an integral part of the proposed project will                   
              be summer research experiences for one student during each                     
              of the 1993, 1994, and 1995 summer periods.  Student                           
              research activities will be directly related to one of the                     
              three research areas of the project and will strengthen the                    
              student research program of the mathematics/computer science                   
              department at Gustavus.
