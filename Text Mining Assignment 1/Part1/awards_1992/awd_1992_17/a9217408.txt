Abstract    :
              This U.S.-Brazil Cooperative Science Program                                   
              award will support the continuing collaboration                                
              of five condensed-matter theorists:  two from                                  
              the U.S.--Leo Falicov of the University of                                     
              California at Berkeley and Mark Robbins of                                     
              Johns Hopkins University--and three from                                       
              Brazil--Belita Koiller of the Pontifical                                       
              Catholic University in Rio de Janeiro, Helio                                   
              Chacham of the Federal University of Minas                                     
              Gerais, and Roberto Osrio of the Federal                                      
              University of Braslia.  The research will                                     
              focus on semiconductor alloys, fluid invasion                                  
              of porous media, and pressure-induced                                          
              electronic phase transitions.                                                  
                                                                                             
              The project extends previous collaborative                                     
              research in the U.S., while Koiller was on                                     
              sabbatical at Johns Hopkins.  NSF support will                                 
              allow the reciprocation of this collaboration,                                 
              by funding three trips by the U.S. side to work                                
              in Brazil.  The project promotes cost-                                         
              effectiveness by teaming a total of five                                       
              different institutions, two in the U.S. and three                              
              in Brazil.  Both the U.S. and Brazilian sides                                  
              will contribute expertise in condensed-matter                                  
              physics theory in application to this important                                
              research topic.
