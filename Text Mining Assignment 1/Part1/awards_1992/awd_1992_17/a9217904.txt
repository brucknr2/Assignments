Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This award supports a two-year collaborative research project                  
              between Professor Jerry P. Becker of Southern Illinois University              
              at Carbondale and Professor Tatsuo Miwa of the Institute for                   
              Applied Optics, Tokyo.  The project involves cross-cultural                    
              research on computer use in teaching mathematical problem solving              
              in schools.  The collaboration stems from a U.S.-Japan seminar on              
              this topic in 1991 and follows major movements in the United States            
              and Japan to reform mathematics education and incorporate use of               
              technology (computers and calculators) to enhance the teaching and             
              learning of mathematics in the classroom.                                      
                                                                                             
              The investigators will address the following areas of research:                
              the aims of teaching mathematics, software use, curriculum                     
              development, development of open-ended mathematics problems,                   
              teacher education, and development of teaching units for cross-                
              cultural use in classrooms.  The research continues earlier                    
              collaboration in studying students' problem solving behaviors in               
              mathematics.  The award is also supported by funds from the                    
              Research in Teaching and Learning Program, Division of Research,               
              Evaluation and Dissemination, Directorate for Education and Human
