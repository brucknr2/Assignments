Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              In a previous study, cataclysmic variables located far from the                
              galactic plane were found to differ in their properties from those             
              near the plane.  Spectra and photometry of such objects will be                
              obtained to study the nature of their binary companions. This will             
              allow the distances to be obtained and from them, luminosities of              
              the accretion disks which give rise to the outbursts of the                    
              variables.  A search for galactic plane counterparts of these                  
              objects will be made.  The relationship of these systems to                    
              theories regarding the hibernation of cataclysmic variables will be            
              explored.
