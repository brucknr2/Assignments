Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This award will support a two-year collaborative research project              
              between Professor Emil Reisler of the University of California,                
              Los Angeles, and Professor Kazuo Sutoh of the University of                    
              Tokyo.  The objectives of the project are to clarify the                       
              mechanism of actomyosin interactions by mapping actomyosin                     
              binding sites in the presence and absence of ATP and to identify               
              structural determinants of actin's function in force generation                
              and motility.  It is anticipated that this research will                       
              contribute to the understanding of biological energy transduction              
              processes.                                                                     
                                                                                             
              The group at the University of Tokyo will generate a large number              
              of Dictyostelium actin mutants, particularly in subdomains I and               
              II of actin, and will test these mutants for actomyosin ATPase                 
              activity, in vitro motility, and force generation functions.  The              
              UCLA group will carry out in depth biochemical analysis of actin               
              mutants with altered or impaired functional properties.  In                    
              addition to the principal investigator, a graduate student and a               
              postdoctoral fellow will each visit Japan for an extended period               
              to participate in the project.
