Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  Most chemical analyses of atmospheric particles are carried               
              out on bulk samples.  However, particle by particle variations in              
              composition strongly influence atmospheric transformations,                    
              visibility degradation, and the fate of particulate pollutants.  In            
              addition, knowledge of the microscopic mixing characteristics of               
              combustion products is essential to understanding particle                     
              formation in combustion.  With the development of computer-                    
              controlled scanning and x-ray detectors which measure elements as              
              light as carbon, the scanning electron microscope (SEM) has a great            
              deal of promise for this application.  However, more development               
              work is needed to assure that the elemental analysis accurately                
              reflects the composition of the aerosol.                                       
                                                                                             
                   The goal of this research is to obtain accurate single                    
              particle analyses of atmospheric aerosols with an electron                     
              microscope.  Monodisperse aerosols of known composition will be                
              used to 1) conduct studies of electron beam damage to major                    
              components of atmospheric aerosols, 2) test methods to reduce beam             
              damage, and 3) validate existing quantitation methods.  The                    
              potential of the SEM for measuring carbon will also be assessed.               
              The techniques developed will be used in the future to identify the            
              elemental characteristics determining the uptake of water by                   
              aerosols.
