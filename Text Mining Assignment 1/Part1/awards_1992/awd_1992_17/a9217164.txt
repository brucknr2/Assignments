Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  The satellite altimeters aboard the Geosat and ERS-1                      
              spacecraft have mapped the marine gravity field over nearly all of             
              the world's oceans to a high accuracy.  The Geosat data south of 30            
              degrees south has recently been declassified.  In the wavelength               
              band 15 to 150 km, variations in gravity anomaly are highly                    
              correlated with seafloor topography.  Since many southern ocean                
              areas are sparsely surveyed, these new Geosat data reveal many                 
              previously unsurveyed features.  The objectives of this project are            
              to: (1) merge the Scripps satellite altimeter processing system                
              with the shipboard data processing system so these data sets can be            
              compared and correlated, (2) investigate three methods for                     
              constructing inverse transfer functions for mapping dense satellite            
              gravity onto the sparse ship topography profiles, (3) extract                  
              regional variations in the topography/gravity transfer function and            
              relate them to tectonic provinces, (4) use topography/transfer                 
              functions to interpolate seafloor topography between sparse ship               
              sounding, and (5) examine variations in topography/gravity transfer            
              function at spreading ridges with emphasis on the variation with               
              spreading rate and distance to ridge/transform intersection.
