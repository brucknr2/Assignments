Abstract    :
              Interstellar grains are thought to form, among other places, in                
              circumstellar flows from novae and infrared variable stars.  Such              
              objects will be observed in the infrared to learn about the                    
              nucleation and growth of grains in these environments, assess the              
              heavy element contributions to the interstellar medium from novae              
              and infrared variable stars, and gain information on stages of                 
              stellar evolution preceding the mass loss.  A network of three                 
              remotely controlled infrared telescopes in three different states              
              will make it possible to begin observations promptly after a nova              
              eruption is detected to determine the composition of the ejecta and            
              to follow the development of dust in the ejecta.  The infrared                 
              variables will be monitored to learn their characteristics and to              
              study the changes in the inner dust shell throughout the                       
              pulsational cycle.
