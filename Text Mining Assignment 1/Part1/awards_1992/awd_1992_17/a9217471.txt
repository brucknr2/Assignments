Abstract    :
              The relationship between structure, reactivity, and energetics                 
              of gas phase organic ion-molecule reactions will be                            
              investigated. A variable temperature flowing afterglow                         
              apparatus, along with ab initio molecular orbital calculations,                
              will be used to carry out these studies. The resulting                         
              information will provide mechanistic insights which are                        
              unavailable from condensed phase work. Species to be                           
              investigated include vinyl, cyclopropyl, and alkyl anions. As                  
              well, unimolecular rearrangements and substituent effects will                 
              be studied. These investigations will provide critical                         
              information on a number of important areas including hydrogen                  
              bonding, nucleophilic substitution, eliminations, orbital                      
              symmetry controlled reactions, and the relationship between                    
              structure, reactivity, and energetics.                                         
              %%%                                                                            
              Many important reactions occur are in the gas phase, including                 
              most of the reactions involved in atmospheric chemistry. This                  
              project will therefore not only contribute to an understanding                 
              of the fundamental principles which control a variety of                       
              chemical transformations, but will also provide a paridigm for                 
              understanding processes which occur in the atmosphere. In this                 
              grant from the Organic Dynamics Program to Professor S. Kass at                
              the University of Minnesota, particular attention will be paid                 
              to investigation of reactions and rearrangements in the gas                    
              phase which involve negatively charged organic species called                  
              anions.
