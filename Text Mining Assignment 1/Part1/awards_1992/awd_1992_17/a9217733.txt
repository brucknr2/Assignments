Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Support is provided for the acquisition of side-looking sonar                  
              imagery to study one of the world's most important subsea "drainage            
              systems" situated directly in front of the outlet of the                       
              Pleistocene Laurentide icecap in the Hudson Strait and extending to            
              the slopes and basins of the Labrador Sea.  The proposed research              
              is a multi-year collaborative effort between McGill University,                
              Montreal, Canada, Bedford Institute of Oceanography (BIO)/ Atlantic            
              Geoscience Centre (AGC), Dartmouth, Nova Scotia, the Geological                
              Observatory (L-DGO) of Columbia University.  The scientific                    
              objectives to be addressed are three fold.  (1) To define                      
              depositional and morphological elements of the Northwest Atlantic              
              Mid-Ocean Canyon (NAMOC), as a type example of non-classical fan               
              turbidite system without shifting distributary channels and                    
              terminal lobes and to acquire a quantitative hydrodynamic                      
              understanding of the sediment-laden flows that have passed through             
              the channels.  (2) To identify the principle sedimentological                  
              processes active on an ice-marginal slope and to explain variation             
              in continental slope dynamics in terms of ice sheet expansion and              
              rapid melting.  (3) To use data collected in the program to advance            
              the techniques of remote acoustic characterization of the                      
              sedimentary substrate.
