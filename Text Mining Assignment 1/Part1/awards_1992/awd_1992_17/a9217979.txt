Abstract    :
              Research will be carried out in the following areas: Precision                 
              measurement of atomic Permanent Electric Dipole Moments and                    
              fundamental symmetries; electron scattering from polarized He-3                
              at intermediate and high energies to extract information on                    
              neutron structure; neutron beta-decay experiments to measure the               
              neutron half life and measure the D-coefficient with a polarized               
              neutron beam.  Specific goals over the next three years are (1)                
              Measurement of the permanent electric dipole moment of Xe-129                  
              with He-3 magnetometry using magnetic induction detection of free              
              precession; (2) Development of new precision measurement                       
              techniques one to two orders of magnitude more sensitive than the              
              magnetic induction technique with application to the electric                  
              dipole moment experiments and tests of fundamental ideas                       
              including Linearity in Quantum Mechanics and Local Lorentz                     
              Invariance;  (3)  To run SLAC experiments E-142, polarized                     
              electron scattering from polarized He-3 to measure the spin                    
              dependent structure function of the neutron and test the Bjorken               
              sum rule; (4) To run SLAC experiment E-143, polarized electron                 
              scattering from polarized H1 and H2 as part of the program begun               
              with E-142; (5) To run experiments 88-25 at Bates, inclusive                   
              quasi-elastic scattering of polarized electrons from polarized                 
              He-3; (6) To design an experiment to continue the inclusive and                
              exclusive quasi-elastic scattering measurements at CEBAF which                 
              will allow higher momentum transfer and greater precision; and                 
              (7) To measure the D-coefficient in polarized neutron decay and                
              improve the neutron half life measurements by employing advanced               
              methods of neutron flux measurement.
