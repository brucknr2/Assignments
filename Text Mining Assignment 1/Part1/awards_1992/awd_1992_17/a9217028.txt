Abstract    :
              9217028  Sorbjan         The PIs propose to use large eddy simulation model with
              a  nested grid to develop new and improve existing parameterizations  of
              dynamic and thermal effects in the atmospheric mixed layer.   Initially,
              idealized simulations of the following four regimes of  the convective boundary
              layer will be performed:  (1) non-  penetrative and shearless, (2) penetrative
              and shearless, (3) non-  penetrative with shear, and (4) penetrative with
              shear.  From  these, a comparison of non-penetrative and penetrative shearless 
              regimes will be used to investigate entrainment processes on the  top of the
              CBL.  In addition, a study of the shearless and sheared  regimes will be
              performed to develop a parameterization the sheared  CBL.  Furthermore, they
              will also investigate effects of moist  convection with cumulus-humilis type of
              clouds on dynamics of the  mixed layer.  Finally, they will attempt to test
              parameterizations  of the sheared CBL regimes through comparison with
              observations  taken during the Phoenix and the Stormfest experiments.  The 
              developed parameterizations are hoped to be used in numerical  weather
              prediction and climate simulation models.  ***
