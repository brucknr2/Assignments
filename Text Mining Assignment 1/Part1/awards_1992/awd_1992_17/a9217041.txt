Abstract    :
                   The Grand Challenge Application Groups competition provides               
              one mechanism for the support of multidisciplinary teams of                    
              scientists and engineers to meet the goals of the High Performance             
              Computing and Communications (HPCC) Initiative in Fiscal Year 1992.            
              The ideal proposal provided not only excellence in science:                    
              focussed problem with potential for substantial impact in a                    
              critical area of science and engineering) but also significant                 
              interactions between scientific and computational activities,                  
              usually involving mathematical, computer or computational                      
              scientists, that would have impact in high-performance                         
              computational activity beyond the specific scientific or                       
              engineering problem area(s) or discipline being studied. In the                
              award to Berwick, Bizzi, Bulthoff, Jordan, Wexler, Poggio, Rivest,             
              Winston, and Yang at MIT, the research project - High Performance              
              Computing for Learning - has been designed explicitly to push the              
              High Performance Computing algorithmic and architectural envelope              
              via a CM-5 and VLSI testbed and to address many of the HPCC goals.             
              It will advance new algorithms and software for a broad class of               
              optimization and learning problems, tested on and directly driving             
              operating system and architectural changes on the CM-5 (working                
              with one of the CM-5's key architects). The learning problems                  
              addressed are essentially an entire class of modeling/optimization             
              problems that intersect with nearly all HPCC Grand Challenge                   
              Problems.
