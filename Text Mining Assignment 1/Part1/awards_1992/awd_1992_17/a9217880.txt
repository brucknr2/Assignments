Abstract    :
              This award is made as the starter grant increment of Dr. Nancy                 
              Levinger's Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in Chemistry Award                 
              in support of her research at Colorado State University. This                  
              research will probe the role of molecular modes in photoinduced                
              charge transfer reactions, especially electron transfer. A                     
              detailed molecular picture of the structural changes and                       
              dynamics of chemical reactions in solution will be developed.                  
              One of several systems to be studied is electron transfer of                   
              nitrosyl or nitrosonium cations with arenes. Reactions will be                 
              followed by time-resolved resonance Raman spectroscopy and time                
              resolved visible and ultraviolet pump/infrared probe absorption                
              spectroscopy.                                                                  
              %%%                                                                            
              Charge-transfer process are ubiquitous in chemistry. The                       
              detailed vibrationally resolved information gathered in this                   
              research will extend our understanding of the complicated                      
              behavior of charge-transfer processes in solution.
