Abstract    :
              This research program will exploit a newly developing methodology              
              to resolve a controversy regarding the cycling of carbon, oxygen,              
              and nitrogen at the sediment-water interface.  These studies will              
              serve as an indicator of pelagic-benthic coupling and the                      
              availability and fate of fixed carbon on the extensive shallow-                
              water shelves in the Arctic.  This study will also provide cross               
              comparison between shipboard sediment incubations and in-situ                  
              benthic flux studies to monitor fluxes of oxygen, carbon dioxide,              
              and nutrients with overlying bottom water.  This program will be               
              conducted in conjunction with previously funded research to                    
              evaluate the role of the Arctic shelves in global biogeochemical               
              cycling.  These complimentary programs will take place on-board                
              the R.V. Alpha Helix in the Chukchi and Beaufort Seas during the               
              summer of 1992.
