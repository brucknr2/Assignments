Abstract    :
              This is the first year of a three-year continuing award.  The                  
              research investigates a new approach to surface reeconstruction in             
              computer vision. Surface reconstruction, the process of recovering             
              descriptions of the visible surfaces in a scene from a noisy and               
              perhaps sparse set of depth points, plays a fundamental role in                
              such robotic tasks as object modeling, grasp planning and                      
              navigation.  Standard approaches have two limitations:  they assume            
              that there are no extreme errors in the data; and they assume that             
              the visible surface can be accurately modeled with a single                    
              piecewise continuous function of the image coordinates.  These                 
              limitations severely restrict the applicability of present surface             
              reconstruction techniques.  The new approach overcomes these                   
              problems using a two phase technique:  (1) a local estimation phase            
              that produces polynomial surface patches in regions throughout the             
              image, including possibly overlapping surfaces, and (2) a global               
              refinement phase that links and refines mutually consistent local              
              estimates.
