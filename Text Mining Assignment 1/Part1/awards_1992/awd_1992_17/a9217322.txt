Abstract    :
              At the end of its active life, a massive star will experience                  
              sudden collapse.  This is followed by a rebound to produce a                   
              supernova explosion.  While the basic mechanism has been known for             
              some time, supernova models have been unable to reproduce the                  
              observed energies of these events.  The PI showed that convective              
              instabilities occur near the core of the rebounding star which he              
              believes are of central importance to the explosion and which will             
              rectify the energy deficiency.  With previous NSF support, he has              
              developed a hydrodynamic code to study the development of the                  
              instabilities and now proposes to embark on multi-dimensional                  
              studies of supernova explosions.
