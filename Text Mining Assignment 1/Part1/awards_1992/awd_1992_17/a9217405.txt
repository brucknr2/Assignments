Abstract    :
                   This award supports a conference entitled: "Conference on                 
              Large Scale Optimization".                                                     
                   The conference will be held from 15 to 17 February 1992, at               
              the University of Florida.  The conference will be concerned with              
              algorithms, applications, and software for large scale                         
              optimization.  The topics will include applications in the fields              
              of engineering, computer science, operations research, optimal                 
              control, economics, telecommunications, and stochastic                         
              optimization.  Its major objective is to provide a forum for                   
              cross-disciplinary exchange of research advances, as well as a                 
              foundation for joint research cooperation and stimulation for                  
              future research.
