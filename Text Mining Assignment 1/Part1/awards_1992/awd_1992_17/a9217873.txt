Abstract    :
                   The funding will support the attendance of eight graduate                 
              students at the 9th Winter Conference on Nuclear Dynamics to                   
              be held in Fort Myers, Florida, in January 1993.  This series                  
              of workshops brings together experts representing the full                     
              spectrum of nuclear dynamics, ranging from low-energy                          
              reactions at ATLAS, Holifield, and Daresbury through medium-                   
              energy collisions at many laboratories to high-energy                          
              interactions at AGS, CERN, and RHIC.  The workshop proceedings                 
              will be published.
