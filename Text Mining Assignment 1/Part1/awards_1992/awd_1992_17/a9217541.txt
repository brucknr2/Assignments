Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This Science in Developing Countries award will                                
              support twelve U.S. mathematicians to participate in                           
              the Second Latin American Meeting in Analysis.  This                           
              meeting is being organized by the Latin American                               
              Federation of Mathematical Societies and the                                   
              Colombian Mathematical Society and will emphasize                              
              nonlinear analysis, functional analysis, partial                               
              differential equations and differential geometry and                           
              other areas of analysis.  Participants will deliver                            
              plenary talks and lead informal sessions with Latin                            
              American researchers interested in a common set of                             
              problems.  The project will involve students and                               
              active researchers.                                                            
                                                                                             
              This meeting will provide an opportunity for highly                            
              regarded U.S. mathematicians to interact with their                            
              Latin American counterparts.  This opportunity is                              
              fundamental, not only in fostering short and log-                              
              term projects on specific research problems in                                 
              analysis, but also in helping to sustain the                                   
              mathematical infrastructure of the countries of the                            
              region.
