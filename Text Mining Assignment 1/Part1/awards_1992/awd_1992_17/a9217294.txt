Abstract    :
              Hannes Jonsson is supported by a grant from the Theoretical                    
              and Computational Chemistry Program in the Chemistry                           
              Division, the Materials Theory Program in the Division of                      
              Materials Research, and the New Technologies Program in the                    
              Division of Advanced Scientific Computing to develop                           
              scalable, portable computational algorithms for performing                     
              Car-Parrinello (CP) simulations on MIMD computers.  This                       
              grant is part of the Computational Approaches to Real                          
              Materials initiative in Division of Materials Research and                     
              the High Performance Computing and Communications                              
              Initiative.  Jonnson will optimize the CP code for massively                   
              parallel computers, and use it to perform simulation studies                   
              of short range order in Silicon and Aluminum bulk liquids                      
              and solid-liquid interfaces.  For comparison with these                        
              first principles simulations, Jonnson will also carry out                      
              Monte Carlo and Molecular Dynamics Simulations using                           
              empirical potential functions, in particular the Stillinger-                   
              Weber potential for Silicon and and Embedded Atom Method                       
              potential for Aluminum.                                                        
              %%%                                                                            
              A molecular level understanding of the atomic and molecular                    
              interactions is of key importance in the rational design of                    
              new materials.  Theoretical and computational approaches to                    
              this problem will be significantly enhanced through the use                    
              of massively parallel computers.  The Car-Parrinello                           
              methodology shows great promise as a first principles                          
              approach to understanding such interactions, but its                           
              applications are currently limited by the speed of vector                      
              processors.  Jonnson proposes to adapt the Car-Parrinello                      
              algorithms for massively parallel computers which should                       
              significantly enhance their applicability to more complex                      
              materials systems.
