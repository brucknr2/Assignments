Abstract    :
              This is a grant to conduct a workshop composed of NSF grantees                 
              whose awards were made in the new area of inter-disciplinary                   
              research known as Coordination Theory and Collaboration                        
              Technology (CTCT).  The purposes of the workshop are:  First, to               
              provide a forum for the exchange of knowledge in the form of                   
              perspectives, findings, methods and theory for this young,                     
              interdisciplinary field.  Second, to provide an opportunity for                
              the field to coalesce and grow.  While certain subsets of the                  
              community of the researchers mingle at various professional                    
              meetings, as a whole, these investigators do not have regular                  
              contact.  Third, this provides an opportunity for the research                 
              from these projects to be made more visible to the Washington                  
              based research funding and policy community.  This workshop                    
              represents a planning opportunity for the IT&O Program.  The                   
              future research agenda for CT2 funding and community building is               
              an important part of the workshop program.  The workshop is held               
              on July 8 through July 10, 1992 in Washington, DC.  A workshop                 
              report will be prepared and made available through publications                
              and in response to requests.
