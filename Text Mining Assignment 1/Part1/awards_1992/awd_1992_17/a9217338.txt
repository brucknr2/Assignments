Abstract    :
                    Moving  water can dislodge sessile marine organisms.   Such              
              physical  disturbance  can be important  in  structuring  benthic              
              communities.   Sessile  organisms range in stiffness  from  rigid              
              corals  to flexible macroalgae.  The object of this investigation              
              is  to  study  how  the flexural stiffness and  size  of  planar,              
              sessile   organism   (e.g.  many  macrophytes  and   invertebrate              
              colonies)  affect  the  hydrodynamic forces  they  experience  in              
              unidirectional   currents  and  in  waves   (oscillating   flow).              
              Experiments   using   physical  models  in   unidirectional   and              
              oscillating   flow   tanks  will  systematically   quantify   the              
              relationship of an organism's size and stiffness to force and  to              
              local  water  velocities  relative to  the  organism's  surfaces.              
              These   experiments  will  be  complemented  by   similar   field              
              measurements  on real macroalgae and models.  An example  of  the              
              biological   consequences  of  the  relationship  between   size,              
              stiffness,   and   hydrodynamic  force  will   be   explored   by              
              investigating  the  mechanical  interactions  between  encrusting              
              epiphytic bryozoans and the algal hosts they stiffen.  This study              
              is  significant  because it will provide basic  rules  about  the              
              consequences  of  size  and flexibility to the  vulnerability  of              
              sessile  organisms  to physical disturbance in wave-swept  versus              
              current-swept habitats.
