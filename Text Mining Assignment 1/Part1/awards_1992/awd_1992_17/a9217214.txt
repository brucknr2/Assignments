Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This project will involve a detailed petrologic, geochemical, and              
              isotopic (O,S,H & C) investigation of the alteration materials in              
              Site 786 core (Izu-Bonin arc), which is the deepest core in an arc             
              basement with the best recovery.  The goal is to quantify the                  
              nature of the altered material that is being subducted, compare                
              with ophiolite complexes, and obtain constraints on the origin of              
              hydrothermal sulphide ore deposits associated with arc type                    
              materials.
