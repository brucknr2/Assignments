Abstract    :
                   The Grand Challenge Application Groups competition provides               
              one mechanism for the support of multidiscipinary teams of                     
              scientists and engineers to meet the goals of the High Performance             
              Computing and Communications (HPCC) Initiative in Fiscal Year 1992.            
              The ideal proposal provided not only excellence in science:                    
              focussed problem with potential for substantial impact in a                    
              critical area of science and engineering) but also significant                 
              interactions between scientific and computational activities,                  
              usually involving mathematical, computer or computational                      
              scientists, that would have impact in high-performance                         
              computational activity beyond the specific scientific or                       
              engineering problem area(s) or discipline being studied.  In the               
              award to Scott, McCammon, Glowinski, and Pettitt, the research will            
              resolve several issues that will enable high-performance computing             
              to solve critical problems in biomolecular design.  The most                   
              obvious problem relates to the difficulty in using advanced                    
              computer architectures.  Secondly, new algorithms (mathematical and            
              computer science-based) and methods (physical science-based) are               
              needed to solve problems with reasonable efficiency.  Finally,                 
              detailed understanding of what types of problems can be treated                
              with vastly improved computing resources is needed to guide and                
              provoke the development of both algorithms and software.  The grand            
              challenge problem motivating the computational research include                
              thermodynamic cycle perturbation theory applied to ligand-binding              
              proteins and Poisson-Botzman/Brownian dynamics applied to protein              
              design.  The award will support postdoctoral associates, graduate              
              students, and the purchase of a high performance computing system.
