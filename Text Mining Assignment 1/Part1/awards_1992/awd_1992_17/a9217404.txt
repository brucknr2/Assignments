Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This two-year award supports U.S.-France cooperative research                  
              in high energy particle physics between Gerard M. Crawley of                   
              the National Superconducting Cyclotron Laboratory at Michigan                  
              State University and S. Gales of the Nuclear Physics Institute,                
              Orsay, France.  Both research groups will conduct joint,                       
              complementary experiments on decay studies of high lying single                
              particle states and giant resonances.  The understanding of the                
              structure of high lying states in the nucleus will be enhanced                 
              significantly through studies on particle decay.  The investigators            
              will conduct experiments at Michigan State University and at                   
              GANIL facility in France on the following topics: (1) structure                
              of high lying states observed in heavy ion transfer reactions; (2)             
              proton decay of Gamow-Teller and other states in heavy nuclei;                 
              and (3) the existence and properties of the giant isovector                    
              monopole resonance.                                                            
                                                                                             
              This cooperation takes advantage of unique U.S. and French                     
              expertise and facilities. High beam energies, which are necessary              
              for all of the experiments, are available at Michigan State's                  
              National Superconducting Cyclotron Laboratory. The GANIL                       
              facilities in Caen, France, composed of three connected                        
              cyclotrons, a unique spectrometer, and neutron detector array,                 
              are available together with French expertise, to carry out the                 
              complex experiment on giant resonances.
