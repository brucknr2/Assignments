Abstract    :
              A series of projects in nuclear astrophysics will be undertaken.               
              These include studies of nuclear reactions with electron screening             
              taking into account, an analysis of the light curves and long term             
              evolution of novae, nucleosynthesis in nova explosions,                        
              nucleosynthesis in the explosion of massive stars, abundance                   
              history of light elements in the galaxy, the formation of globular             
              clusters and the collapse history of the Milky Way galaxy.
