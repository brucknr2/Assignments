Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This project is a renewal of a previous grant concerned with 2-D               
              modelling of continental extension and rifting.  The P.I. will                 
              extend his earlier developed 2-D model of continental rifting which            
              incorporates the effect of lower crustal flow and explains the                 
              development of wide continental extension areas with high heat                 
              flow.  The P.I. will now use this model to derive the parameters               
              (stress & strain, heat flow, time etc.) which control the long time            
              development of continental margins.  Then these will be compared               
              with several margins as a test.
