Abstract    :
              9217457  Hughes       The goal of this research program is to combine multi-user
               coding and collision resolution to design multiple-access  communicati on
              systems which convey data efficiently, reliably, and  with tolerable delay. 
              Two general issues are addressed.   The  first concerns the assignment of codes
              to a group of M potential  users which permit any subcollection of up to T of
              these users to  transmit reliably at the same time.  This work will explore the
               limits imposed by information theory as well as the design of new  codes.  The
              second part of this research introduces a new  multiple-access scheme called
              protocol division multiple-access  which combines aspects of mutiuser coding,
              collision resolution,  and code division multiple-access. Preliminary results
              suggest  that, for a given throughput, PDMA can significantly reduce message 
              delay on channels with long propagation delays (e.g. satellite  links).  ***
