Abstract    :
              This theoretical research will concentrate on three areas: (i) the             
              dynamics of interfaces separating phases of matter; (ii) the                   
              kinetics of phase transitions; and, (iii) polymer statistical                  
              mechanics.  The work on interface dynamics and pattern formation               
              will involve examples from solidification as well as from fluid                
              mechanics, and will contain aspects of both conceptual, e.g.,                  
              defect dynamics in Hele-Shaw flow, and practical, e.g., materials              
              fabrication, levels.  The kinetics of phase transitions work will              
              involve, for example, studies of the phase separation process under            
              a variety of conditions, e.g., external driving fields or shear                
              flows.  Aspects of this work may have eventual application to the              
              fabrication of polymer blends.  The polymer statistical mechanics              
              research will involve fluctuations in inhomogeneous media and will             
              bear on stabilizing interfaces between different media.

              The study of interfacial regions between different phases of                   
              matter, water and ice, for instance, is one of the most fundamental            
              topics in condensed matter physics and one of the most practical in            
              materials science.  Analytical and numerical techniques will be                
              used to study the evolution of interfaces and the kinetics of                  
              associated phase changes under a variety of conditions.  The                   
              research will have important consequences for materials growth and             
              fabrication, as well as basic physics.
