Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Under an SGER grant (Small Grant for Exploratory Research) a                   
              test for local isotropy of turbulence will be carried out by                   
              an NSF grantee at a large Reynolds number windtunnel at the                    
              NASA Ames Research Laboratory. The experiment will use special                 
              miniature multielement hot-wire probes, and the test for                       
              isotropy will be based on velocity gradient data.                              
                                                                                             
              The experiment will help settle the question of how valid is                   
              the commonly held assumption of universality at the fine                       
              scales of turbulence at high Reynolds numbers, and the range                   
              of validity of this concept. Th concept forms the basis of                     
              present models of turbulent flow in various engineering                        
              systems, and improvement in such predictive models requires                    
              clarification of this basis.
