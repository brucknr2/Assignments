Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The importance of Asian dust-Fe on phytoplankton species                       
              composition will be examined and the Fe limitation hypothesis will             
              be tested across a dust gradient in the macronutrient rich water of            
              the Subarctic Pacific from Kamchatka to Station P.                             
              In situ changes in phytoplankton species composition will be                   
              determined by HPLC pigment analyses and microscopy.  In addition,              
              the project will determine the physiological status of diatoms and             
              prokaryotic algae across this high to low dust gradient in a                   
              relatively unstudied area of the Subarctic Pacific Ocean.
