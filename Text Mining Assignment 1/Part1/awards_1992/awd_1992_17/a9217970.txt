Abstract    :
              The use of globular cluster stars to study early chemical                      
              enrichment in the galaxy is rendered uncertain by the existence of             
              stars in the same cluster with different surface abundances of                 
              carbon, nitrogen, oxygen and possibly other elements.  To clarify              
              the causes of this, a systematic survey of the chemical abundances             
              of stars in different evolutionary states in various clusters will             
              be made.  This investigation is possible for the first time due to             
              the capabilities of new instrumentation at Lick Observatory and the            
              Keck Telescope in Hawaii.
