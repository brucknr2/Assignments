Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This three-year award supports U.S.-France cooperative research                
              in microelectronics among Dimitris Pavlidis, University of                     
              Michigan, Frederique Ducroquet, National Institute for Applied                 
              Sciences (INSA), and S. K. Krawczyk of the Ecole Centrale in                   
              Lyon, France.  The objective of the project is to study                        
              optimization, process control and reliability of high electron                 
              mobility transistors (HEMTs).  The basic heterostructures for                  
              HEMTs will be grown, designed, fabricated and electrically                     
              characterized at the University of Michigan.  These samples will               
              be further analyzed by various material characterization                       
              techniques developed at INSA and the Ecole Centrale in Lyon.                   
              The investigators will characterize the material under optimum                 
              growth conditions, analyze the process and defects induced by                  
              thermal stress.                                                                
                                                                                             
              The U.S. investigator brings to this collaboration expertise in                
              performance optimization of HEMTS and other electronic                         
              devices and the fabrication of novel HEMTs.  This is                           
              complemented by French expertise in various characterization                   
              techniques, which include photo and electro-reflectance                        
              characterization.  The results from the material analysis will                 
              advance understanding of the effects of growth conditions on                   
              material properties and the reliability of such structures.  Such              
              studies are important to the development of new semiconductor                  
              devices.
