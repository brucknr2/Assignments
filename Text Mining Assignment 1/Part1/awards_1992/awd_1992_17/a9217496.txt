Abstract    :
              Theoretical research will be conducted on cooperative phenomena in             
              strongly interacting condensed matter systems.  In particular, the             
              research will focus on the interplay between metal-insulator                   
              transitions, magnetism, superconductivity and Kondo physics in                 
              disordered electronic systems.  The goal of the research is to                 
              understand the possible phases that such systems can display as the            
              disorder and the Fermi liquid parameters are varied.

              Theoretical research will be conducted on systems of electrons                 
              which interact with each other so strongly that conventional                   
              theoretical techniques are not applicable.  These types of material            
              systems are relevant to both current fundamental issues in                     
              condensed matter physics and to real materials such as high                    
              temperature superconductors and electronic materials.
