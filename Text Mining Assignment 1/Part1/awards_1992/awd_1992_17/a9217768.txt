Abstract    :
              The objectives of this research are to develop a theoretical                   
              framework and geometrical algorithms for the robust and fast                   
              intersection of surfaces used in geometric and solid modeling.                 
              Symbolic computation will be used.  That is, instead of                        
              applying algebraic or numerical techniques, the use of a basic                 
              set of geometry routines (line/line intersection, line/circle                  
              intersection, etc.) combined with a set of techniques for the                  
              easy construction and linkage of intersection points is                        
              applied.  The research has the following significant output:                   
                                                                                             
                   o    a set of robust, fast and reliable intersectors that                 
                        are capable of handling special cases such as                        
                        touching and overlapping surfaces,                                   
                                                                                             
                   o    a set of visually describable algorithms that can be                 
                        included in an academic course, and                                  
                                                                                             
                   o    theoretical and computational foundation of robust                   
                        three-dimensional geometric computations.
