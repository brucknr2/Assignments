Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This project supports the dissertation research of an                          
              anthropology student from the University of Michigan.  The                     
              research will examine the relationship between indigenous                      
              politics and the regulation of natural resources in northern                   
              Madagascar.   Using ethnographic methods of participant                        
              observation, structured interviewing, household surveys, extended              
              case studies of resource conflicts, and analysis of remote                     
              sensing images of land use, the student will try to understand                 
              the local populations' patterns of resource use in the context of              
              competing demands from local, national, and international                      
              interests.                                                                     
                                                                                             
              This project is important because Madagascar is a uniquely                     
              important ecological resource for the world.  Understanding the                
              dynamics of resource use by local traditional peoples can help                 
              international aid organizations design programs to satisfy local               
              needs as well as preserve the environment.
