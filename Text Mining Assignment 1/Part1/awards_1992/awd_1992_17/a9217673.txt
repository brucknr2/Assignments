Abstract    :
              The Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution (WHOI) will undertake an              
              engineering development and testing program to upgrade a suite of              
              Ocean Bottom Seismometers (OBS') for deployments of up to one year.            
              Approximately thirty OBS' have been made available to the ocean                
              science community.  Half of the instruments are maintained on the              
              East Coast at WHOI, and an equal number on the West Coast at                   
              Scripps.  The suite of instruments were designed to have common                
              capabilities and response characteristics, and modular design was              
              use2d so various components could be readily upgraded.  The                    
              standard battery packs and data loggers allow for deployments of               
              only two months.  Scientific requirements increasingly call for                
              longer deployments, lasting up to one year.  Two of the standard               
              OBS' will be converted with new battery packs and corrosion                    
              preventative measures.  One of the units will be deployed offshore             
              for a year, but checked on a regular basis.  Results of this                   
              development and testing program will be shared with other                      
              institutions that use the instruments.
