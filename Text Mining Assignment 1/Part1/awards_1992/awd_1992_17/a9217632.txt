Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This Americas Program award will support the first                             
              U.S.-Mexico bilateral symposium on the physics of                              
              complex fluids, organized by Dr. Philip  Pincus of                             
              the University of California, Santa Barbara and Dr.                            
              Magdaleno Medina-Noyola, of the Universidad Autonoma                           
              de San Luis Potosi, Mexico.  The primary objectives                            
              of the symposium are the development of specific                               
              collaborations between U.S. and Mexico; the                                    
              establishment of an organizational framework for                               
              nurturing continuing exchanges; and the development                            
              of a plan for fostering mutual access to special                               
              facilities and instruments in both countries.                                  
                                                                                             
              The complex fluids field, a developing                                         
              multidisciplinary scientific area involving physics,                           
              chemistry and biology, has applications to a diverse                           
              range of technologies, including, among others,                                
              enhanced oil recovery, processing of high                                      
              performance structural ceramics and polymers,                                  
              biomolecular materials, and microreactors.                                     
              Consequently, the symposium will involve                                       
              representatives from academia and industrial                                   
              laboratories as well.
