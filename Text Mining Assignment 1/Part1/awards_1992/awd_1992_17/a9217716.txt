Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Multiwavelength surveys of galaxies are of great importance for                
              investigations of structure and stellar content.  The research to              
              be carried out will be a new, extensive survey of spiral galaxies              
              using wide-field infrared and optical imaging systems developed                
              at The Ohio State University.  Infrared observations are key to                
              this survey because infrared light is a better tracer of the                   
              stellar mass distribution than optical light and the effects of                
              internal absorption by dust are minimized.  Photometry and                     
              infrared long-slit spectroscopy will be used to study the                      
              dependence of stellar content on position, including the                       
              identification of regions of active star formation.  The effects               
              of scattering and absorption by dust on the observed luminosity                
              and color of a galaxy will be investigated.
