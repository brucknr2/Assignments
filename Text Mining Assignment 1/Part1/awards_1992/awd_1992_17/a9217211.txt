Abstract    :
              This project is concerned with glacier and climate variations in               
              the low latitudes, focusing on climatic forcing-response processes.            
              Given the global nature of climate, interest is in the tropics as              
              a whole, with a regional emphasis on East Africa.  The project                 
              components include glacier area-change detection from satellite for            
              selected mountains with suitable "ground truth"; ice volume-change             
              detection from an areo-photogrammetric re-mapping of Mount Kenya's             
              glaciers; a quantitative analysis of the various kinds of climatic             
              forcing that have driven the changes of Lewis Glacier, Mount Kenya,            
              from the latter part of the last century to the 1990's; and with               
              lower priority, a comparative climatic forcing  and retreat history            
              of glaciers in New Guinea, East Africa, and the South American                 
              Andes.  Overall, the project shall follow promising leads in the               
              development of "tropical satellite glaciology" for climate                     
              purposes, in combination with the analysis of existing field                   
              observations, while requiring only limited field work.  Particular             
              attention shall be given to the quantitative evaluation of the                 
              climatic forcing of recent glacier changes that  may be relevant               
              to the "greenhouse" issue.
