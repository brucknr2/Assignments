Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Dr. Gwinn will continue studies of interstellar scattering with                
              very long baseline interferometry (VLBI).  These studies probe the             
              density fluctuations responsible for interstellar scattering,                  
              particularly their spatial spectrum, and the structures of the                 
              scattered sources.  He will: (i) Further study scattering of                   
              Hydroxyl masers in the source W49N; (ii) Study scattering of the               
              Vela pulsar; (iii) Attempt to resolve the emission region of the               
              Vela pulsar at nanoarcsecond scales, using the scattering disk as              
              a lens; (iv) Observe scattering from pulsars showing strong low                
              frequency variability; and (v) Assess the effects of scattering on             
              astrometric observations of the millisecond pulsar 1937-214.                   
              Observations of pulsars will make use of VLBI in the snapshot, or              
              speckle, regime of scattering.
