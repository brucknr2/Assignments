Abstract    :
              This US-Brazil Cooperative Science award will                                  
              support the research collaboration of Edward                                   
              Green of Virginia Polytechnic Institute and                                    
              State University and Eduardo Marcos of the                                     
              University of Sao Paulo, Brazil.  The project                                  
              aims to explore the category of graded modules                                 
              of a graded ring by studying the local theory                                  
              which the two researchers have introduced.                                     
                                                                                             
              The PIs will investigate two specific problems.                                
              First, they will study finite dimensional                                      
              algebras which are locally of finite type (a                                   
              notion they have defined for graded algebras).                                 
              They expect that these graded algebras should                                  
              have the property that the number of "gradable"                                
              components in the Auslander-Reiten quiver is                                   
              finite.  Second, they will investigate the                                     
              local structure of the category of graded                                      
              Cohen-Macaulay modules over a graded local                                     
              commutative algebra by studying an equivalent                                  
              subcategory of the category of modules over a                                  
              finite dimensional algebra.  The US side will                                  
              contribute expertise in graded modules and                                     
              finite dimensional representation theory.  The                                 
              Brazilian side will contribute expertise in                                    
              Cohen-Macaulay modules.  Through this                                          
              collaboration, both sides will gain a better                                   
              understanding of representation theory, an                                     
              important topic in mathematics.
