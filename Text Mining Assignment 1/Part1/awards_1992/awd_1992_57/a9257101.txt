Abstract    :
              Motivated by the need for robust polymers optically superior to                
              polyamides yet suitable for cointegration of optical                           
              interconnection waveguides directly with the active CMOS                       
              interconnection substrate of advanced multi-chip modules (MCMs),               
              the research seeks to fabricate the first optical waveguides with              
              polyphenylsilsesquioxane (PPSQ), a spin castable, low temperature              
              processed silicon ladder polymer used as a thin and thick film                 
              dielectric for microelectronics.  This material potentially offers             
              the low loss obtainable with less stable optical polymers while                
              offering thermal stability and process latitude (patterning, wet,              
              dry etching) exceeding that of polyamide.  This research assesses              
              the suitability of PPSQ together with planarizing and superstrate              
              polymer layers for providing a multilayer system supporting                    
              fabrication of high density waveguide arrays directly over the Si              
              devices of emerging active MCM substrate.
