Abstract    :
              The focus of this research is the development of high performance              
              analog architectures and circuits for mixed analog-digital IC's.               
              Emphasis will be placed on improving the immunity of the analog                
              circuits to digital switching noise and in obtaining high speed and            
              accuracy analog circuit performance with the newly emerging 3.3                
              Volt power supply standard.  Current-mode circuits will be examined            
              as a way of overcoming these limitations and this research will                
              yield a general understanding of the advantages and limitations of             
              current-mode circuits as compared to voltage-mode circuits.  The               
              current-mode circuits will be used to implement area efficient,                
              high-order sigma-delta A/D converters.
