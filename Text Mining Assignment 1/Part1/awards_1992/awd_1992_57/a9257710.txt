Abstract    :
              Dr. Moore will compare soil webs from nine established and three               
              proposed paired native and disturbed sites to detect pattern in                
              the effects of anthropogenic disturbance of food web structure                 
              and function.  The research will be coupled with a program where               
              primary and secondary school teachers from U.S. school districts               
              near the sites and student teachers at the University of Northern              
              Colorado will be given summer research experience to augment                   
              their curricula.
