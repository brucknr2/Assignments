Abstract    :
                   This young investigator's research focuses on studies of the              
              Earth's interior utilizing high-pressure and high-temperature                  
              experiments.  Specific research interests include the physics and              
              chemistry of high-pressure minerals and melts and the thermal                  
              structure of the Earth's interior.  Her research is conducted at               
              the Institute of Tectonics of the University of California at                  
              Santa Cruz.
