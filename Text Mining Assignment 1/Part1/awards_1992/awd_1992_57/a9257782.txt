Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The research plan that the PI has initiated will answer a                      
              long-standing puzzle of embryology- how do inducers transmit                   
              their effects to cause particular patterns of organ formation                  
              in vertebrates? The PI is involved in several innovative teaching              
              projects, and is committed to increasing the standard of science               
              education in the United States.  This NYI award will free time                 
              that she would otherwise devote to grant applications and allow                
              her attention to focus on performing research of the highest                   
              quality and on implementing changes in both the curriculum of                  
              her home institution and in the involvement of scientists                      
              in school-level education.
