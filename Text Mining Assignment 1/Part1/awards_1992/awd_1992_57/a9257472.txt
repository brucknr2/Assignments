Abstract    :
                   This NYI award will support the research of a promising and               
              accomplished young investigator.  His research will include a                  
              experimental and theoretical investigation of very low energy                  
              molecular collision processes using a collisional cooling                      
              technique.  These studies will enable a more precise                           
              determination of intermolecular potential surfaces and contribute              
              to a deeper understanding of molecular collision dynamics, energy              
              transfer, and conditions in interstallar gas clouds and outer                  
              planet atmospheres.
