Abstract    :
                 Intelligent systems often need to deal with two kinds of                    
              uncertainty: (1) system requirements that are qualitative in                   
              nature, and (2) uncertainty about the state of the external                    
              environment. The primary objective of this research is to develop              
              sound and practical techniques for dealing with these issues. To               
              address the first issue, fuzzy logic based methodologies for                   
              specifying and validating qualitative requirements are being                   
              developed. Explicitly capturing the elasticity of the system's                 
              requirements facilitates the exploration of various trade-offs                 
              during the design stage and enables a more realistic validation of             
              the implemented system. To address the second issue, systematic                
              modeling techniques for designing hybrid autonomous intelligent                
              systems are being developed. These techniques use fuzzy logic to               
              integrate AI symbolic problem solving with the numeric processing              
              exhibited by neural networks and model-based control. Potential                
              industrial applications of such hybrid systems range from the                  
              petrochemical process control to autonomous vehicle systems and                
              automated manufacturing systems. Methodologies and techniques                  
              developed in this research project will not only enhance the                   
              quality and the adaptability of the next generation of intelligent             
              systems, but will also reduce the cost for designing and                       
              maintaining them.
