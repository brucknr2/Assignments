Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This research includes studies on the effect of coarsening, grain              
              growth and particle packing on densification, defect formation and             
              constitutive parameters, and reactive processing of composites and             
              constrained films.  Sub-critical mechanical properties (e.g.                   
              fatigue and creep) of ceramic composites and multilayered systems              
              including film-substrate assemblies will also be determined.
