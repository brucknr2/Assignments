Abstract    :
              The research plan involves the rheological behavior of fresh cement            
              paste and concrete.  There are a number of challenging scientific              
              issues in cement rheology.  It is critical to understand the                   
              various dynamic microstructural processes, not only to understand              
              flow behavior of cement paste, but also to predict and control flow            
              of concrete.  One dynamic process is hydration, through which                  
              concrete transforms from liquid to solid.  Another is flocculation             
              and the response of flocculated particles to shear.  The long-                 
              range objective during the next five years is to develop a                     
              microstructure-based model to simulate the flow behavior of cement             
              past and concrete.  The effort will focus on developing a dynamic              
              computer-based microstructural simulation of hydration,                        
              flocculation and flow behavior.  The simulation will be based on               
              physicochemical aspects of particle interactions, including those              
              resulting from hydration reactions, an approach generally similar              
              to non-equilibrium molecular dynamics, a recent approach for                   
              modeling flow behavior of suspensions.
