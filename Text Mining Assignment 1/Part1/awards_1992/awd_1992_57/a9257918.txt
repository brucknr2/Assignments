Abstract    :
                   The research will develop new effective statistical methods               
              for improving product quality, manufacturability, and                          
              reliability.  Specific research topics include:  (1) robust                    
              design/Taguchi methods for improving product and manufacturing                 
              process design, (2) experimental design methods for optimizing                 
              job shop or manufacturing systems configurations or policies, and              
              (3) statistical process control methods for monitoring                         
              manufacturing processes with multiple correlated quality                       
              characteristics.                                                               
                   The research will involve academic researchers, engineers                 
              from industry, and students to develop new statistical methods to              
              solve industrial problems.  Practical strategies, techniques, and              
              tools will be developed and implemented.
