Abstract    :
              This is an NSF Young Investigator Award.  The research                         
              addresses the processing of nanoscale materials with unusual                   
              surface reactivity and physical properties for catalysis and                   
              ceramic applications.                                                          
                                                                                             
              One objective is to achieve highly dense materials at                          
              relatively low sintering temperatures by exploiting the small                  
              grain size and enhanced surface diffusion of nanometer-sized                   
              particles prepared by the gas condensation method.  Structural                 
              evolution of the nanostructured materials is observed by X-ray                 
              diffraction, atomic force microscopy, and photoacoustic                        
              infrared spectroscopy.  Mechanical properties of these                         
              materials are also analyzed for net-shape forming and high-                    
              temperature applications.                                                      
                                                                                             
              Nanostructural composites are synthesized as supported metal                   
              catalysts; these materials should offer high metal dispersion                  
              and                                                                            
              possibly enhanced catalytic activity, and can be engineered to                 
              have a high density of uniform nanoscale pores.  The thermal                   
              stability, selectivity, and reactivity of nanostructure                        
              catalysts in chemical manufacturing processes are studied and                  
              compared to those of catalysts produced by sol-gel synthesis                   
              or traditional impregnation methods.  Catalysts are                            
              characterized by small-angle X-ray scattering, Moessbauer                      
              spectroscopy, atomic force microscopy, positron annihilation                   
              spectroscopy, and calorimetry.  Reaction kinetics of processes                 
              using the novel catalysts are followed with high-temperature                   
              photoacoustic infrared spectroscopy.
