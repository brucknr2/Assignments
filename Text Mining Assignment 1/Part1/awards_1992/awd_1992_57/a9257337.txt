Abstract    :
                   This research will focus on the application of artificial                 
              neural systems to decision problems involving pattern recognition,             
              prediction and optimization; the design of adaptive neural                     
              algorithms for these problems; and the application of common                   
              operations research tools to the study of artificial neural                    
              networks.  Neural networks are being applied to problems from the              
              operations research domain, and this research is involved in the               
              use of network and routing problems.  In addition, mathematical                
              programming will be applied to the design and modification of                  
              neural networks for decision problems involving pattern recognition            
              and prediction.                                                                
                   Additional research will utilize concepts concerning adaptive             
              supervised and unsupervised neural networks and how to select,                 
              construct, and train them.  The use of neural networks in the area             
              of tool wear monitoring and prediction, product demand prediction,             
              and quantification of human driving comfort will be investigated.
