Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This program will establish the first facility in the U.S. for                 
              crystallographic analysis of defects in bulk samples using electron            
              channeling contrast imaging (ECCI).  The facility will be used in              
              current and new research programs including the examination of                 
              crack tip processes in brittle materials, interfacial studies in               
              composites, and thin film/coatings analysis.
