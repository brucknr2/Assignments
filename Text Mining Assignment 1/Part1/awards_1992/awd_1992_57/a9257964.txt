Abstract    :
              The focus of this research is on the development of innovative VLSI            
              design methodologies that will facilitate the next generation of               
              high performance signal processing and computing systems.  A                   
              variety of analog, digital, and mixed signal circuitry will be                 
              implemented for use in high performance computing applications                 
              including object recognition, smart sensors, adaptive neural                   
              networks, and programmable analog filters.
