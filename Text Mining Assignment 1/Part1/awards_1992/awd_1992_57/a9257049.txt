Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This National Science Foundation Young Investigator Award will                 
              support the construction of theoretical models of stars and the                
              effects of radial and nonradial stellar oscillation on stellar                 
              spectra.  The principal investigator, Dr. Steven Kawaler, will use             
              these models, together with observations of variable stars and                 
              techniques of stellar seismology, to understand the internal                   
              structure and evolution of stars.
