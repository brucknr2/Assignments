Abstract    :
              This 1992 National Science                                                     
              Foundation Young Investigators                                                 
              (NYI) grant focuses on the                                                     
              development of computational                                                   
              techniques which can control                                                   
              engineering analysis accuracy using                                            
              adaptive multiscale techniques.                                                
              This approach is a hybrid of the                                               
              hierarchical modeling technique                                                
              based on the a posteriori                                                      
              estimation of discretization                                                   
              errors.  The techniques developed                                              
              will be general, however, specific                                             
              emphasis will be given to the                                                  
              analysis of advanced material                                                  
              behavior.
