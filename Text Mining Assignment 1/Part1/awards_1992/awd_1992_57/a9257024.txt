Abstract    :
              This National Science Foundation Young Investigator project is in              
              the general area of analytical and surface chemistry and in the                
              subfields of bioanalysis and neurochemistry.  During the tenure of             
              this five-year award, Professor Sweedler and his students will                 
              develop the analytical instrumentation and methodology capable of              
              identifying and quantifying neuronal releasates from a single                  
              nerve terminal and the contents of individual varicosities, and                
              then use those techniques to better understand the mechanisms of               
              cellular communication.  Specific thrusts include the development              
              of capillary zone electrophoresis/laser induced fluorescence                   
              instrumentation and methodology to assay and quantitate the                    
              contents of individual varicosities and vesicles; demonstration of             
              the capabilities of that instrumentation using cultured neurons;               
              study of the distribution of neuropeptides within individual                   
              neurons of the giant marine mollusk Aplysia; quantitative                      
              measurement of the peptide content of individual varicosities                  
              along a nerve process; measurement of the release of neuropeptides             
              from a single nerve terminal; and determination of whether                     
              facilitation in Aplysia neurons is due to enhancement of                       
              neurotransmitter release.                                                      
              %%%                                                                            
              The successful attainment of the goals of this project will afford             
              protocols for the reliable quantitation of analytes in the                     
              zeptomole range, thereby extending the sensitivity of conventional             
              cell sampling techniques by over a thousand fold.  This research               
              will also serve to further bridge the scientific domains of                    
              analytical chemistry and cellular neurobiology, lead to a                      
              description of the subcellular dynamics of neuronal signalling,                
              and contribute to our basic understanding of the nervous system.
