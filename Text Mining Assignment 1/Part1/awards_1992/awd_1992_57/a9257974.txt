Abstract    :
                This NYI award is made in recognition of significant achievements as         
              a researcher and teacher and high potential for future contributions           
              to this country's scientific and engineering enterprise.  It supports          
              research in operating systems for high performance computer                    
              architectures and applications.  In particular, the appropriate                
              division of responsibility between the operating system kernel and             
              each application will be investigated from the standpoint of                   
              delivering major improvements in application performance on high               
              performance computer systems.
