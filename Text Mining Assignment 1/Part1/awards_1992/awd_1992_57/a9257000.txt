Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Nanometer-sized silicon-metal Schottky barriers will be fabricated             
              in a scanning tunneling microscope (STM) by an electrochemical                 
              deposition method.  The electrical properties of these interfaces,             
              which are measured in-situ in the STM, will allow the chemical                 
              nature of the silicon-metal interface to be deduced.
