Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The applicant's research program is concerned with the                         
              mathematical description of convection and diffusion of                        
              macromelus in microstructured materials, and the                               
              thermodynamics of fluid vapor equilibrium.  Applications of                    
              the transport research include the development of micro-                       
              tailored enzyme carriers and novel separation systems.
