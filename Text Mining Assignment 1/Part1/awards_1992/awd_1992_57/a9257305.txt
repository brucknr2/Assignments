Abstract    :
              The research plan focuses on evaluation of alternative                         
              materials for use as waste containment barriers,                               
              compatibility testing protocol of barrier materials,                           
              and the development of a 2-D, three-phase flow model for                       
              heterogeneous material for use in evaluating the effectiveness                 
              of capillary barriers for waste site remediation and                           
              back-calculation of soil hydraulic conductivity values from                    
              field-measured fluxes at existing landfills.
