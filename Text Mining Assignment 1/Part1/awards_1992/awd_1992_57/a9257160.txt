Abstract    :
                   This young investigator proposes to study fluid-rock                      
              interactions in crustal rocks by integrating fluid flow,                       
              petrologic, and geochemical modelling with carefully selected                  
              field case studies.  Metal speciation and mineral solubility in                
              supercritical chloride solutions will be determined from                       
              experiment and theory.  This work will be done at the University               
              of Wisconsin, Madison, Wisconsin.
