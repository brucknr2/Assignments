Abstract    :
                   This research, supported by a National Science Foundation                 
              Young Investigator award, will continue the development of a non-              
              linear analogue of the theory of type and cotype by studying                   
              Markov chains in metric spaces.  The research will also study the              
              'reverse' geometric inequalities for solid bodies using methods                
              from harmonic analysis and probability theory.                                 
                   The National Science Foundation Young Investigator award                  
              recognizes outstanding young faculty.  This award recognizes the               
              recipient's strong potential for continued professional growth as              
              a research mathematician and for significant development as a                  
              teacher and academic leader.
