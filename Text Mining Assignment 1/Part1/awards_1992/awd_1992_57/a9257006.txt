Abstract    :
                   This research, supported by a National Science Foundation                 
              Young Investigator award, involves the study of mixture models,                
              including the development of graphical diagnostics and formal                  
              tests for identifying the presence of mixing in generalized                    
              linear models, determining the numbers of components in finite                 
              mixture models, and the development of methods to incorporate the              
              full information available in case-control studies with errors in              
              variables.                                                                     
                   The National Science Foundation Young Investigator award                  
              recognizes outstanding young faculty.  This award recognizes the               
              recipient's strong potential for continued professional growth as              
              a research mathematician and for significant development as a                  
              teacher and academic leader.
