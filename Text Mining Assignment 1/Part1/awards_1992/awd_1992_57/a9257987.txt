Abstract    :
              Burns         This research is on developing a unifying design language  and
              framework in which asynchronous circuit designs can be  completely specified,
              and in which decisions made during  synthesis of the implementation can be
              recorded.  The language is  an extension of Hoare's CSP with a means to specify
              structural  hierarchy with a refinement hierarchy superimposed upon it.  The 
              research consists of three interconnected tasks: language  definition;
              developing tools such as a parser, flattener, view  generator, handshaking
              expansions, and production rule sets; and  application of the tools to a large
              design or a real time system.   An algorithm for determining the maximum time
              separation of event  occurrences in a concurrent system is being developed.
