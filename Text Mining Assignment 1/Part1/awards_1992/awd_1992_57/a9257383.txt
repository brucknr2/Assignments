Abstract    :
              The author will study the kinetics                                             
              of pulsed glow discharges related to                                           
              semiconductor processing.  There are                                           
              several important differences                                                  
              between pulsed and continuous                                                  
              discharges which have yet to be                                                
              thoroughly investigated.  First, the                                           
              modulated excitation source causes                                             
              the electron energy distribution                                               
              function (EEDF) to become time                                                 
              dependent.  As a consequence,                                                  
              modulated excitation sources should                                            
              make it possible to control the time                                           
              averaged EEDF even though it is                                                
              difficult to control in continuous                                             
              glows.  The author will study power                                            
              deposition mechanisms at discharge                                             
              initiation as well as discharge                                                
              decay mechanisms in order to                                                   
              determine whether an appropriately                                             
              modulated excitation source can be                                             
              used to optimize the kinetics of a                                             
              particular process.  Second, the                                               
              transport of negative ions to                                                  
              surfaces can be controlled in pulsed                                           
              discharges and may allow for a study                                           
              of the interactions of negative ions                                           
              with surfaces as well as the                                                   
              transport of particulates.  Finally,                                           
              pulsed discharges offer a technique                                            
              for positive ion energy control in                                             
              reactive ion etching, since the dc                                             
              self bias voltage can be controlled.                                           
              The author will combine plasma state                                           
              measurements with wafer state                                                  
              measurements, and modeling in the                                              
              course of this research.
