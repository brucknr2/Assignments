Abstract    :
              Varma         This research aims to develop architectures and protocols  for
              highspeed interconnection within computer systems.  Typical  applications to be
              considered include interconnection of  processor subsystems among themselves
              for multiprocessor  configurations, and the interconnection of processors to
              I/O  subsystems.  The focus is on high-speed crossbar switches as the 
              interconnection means.  The structure of these switches as well  as mechanisms
              for connection setup, routing, and flow-control  across multiple cascaded
              switches are being studied.  Photonic  switch architectures obtained by
              combining dimensions of  switching, such as wavelength and space, are under
              investigation.
