Abstract    :
                   This research, supported by a National Science Foundation                 
              Young Investigator award, studies Riemannian geometry, with                    
              emphasis on understanding how bounds on geometric quantities                   
              affect the local and global topological structure of metric                    
              spaces and Riemannian manifolds and understanding how geometric                
              quantities relate to each other.                                               
                   The National Science Foundation Young Investigator award                  
              recognizes outstanding young faculty.  This award recognizes the               
              recipient's strong potential for continued professional growth as              
              a research mathematician and for significant development as a                  
              teacher and academic leader.
