Abstract    :
                 This award supports on-going research efforts on interactive  computational
              models which incorporate both randomness and  nondeterminism in novel ways.  A
              fundamental goal of the work is  to address what is probably the major open
              problem in computer  science:  how randomness and nondeterminism help in
              computation.  Representative problems in this area are stochastic games,
              automata  theory and random walks on graphs.  Stochastic games model a large 
              class of problems in optimization called decision problems under  uncertainty. 
              Finite state automata are studied with both nondeterministic and  random states
              in order to understand the difference between such  models and their
              deterministic counterparts.  New questions about random walks have been
              formulated on graphs that  are partly controlled by an adversary; in our
              scenario edges of the  graph are colored and the adversary can control the walk
              by specifying  which color edge is followed at a given step.  Further this
              award supports ongoing research regarding the need for a  more realistic theory
              of parallel computation.  The design and  implementation of algorithms on
              parallel machines is combined  with analysis of these algorithms on realistic
              models.  Two  algorithmic paradigms will be restudied:  dynamic programming and
               branch and bound.  Emphasis will be on applications of dynamic  programming to
              problems in DNA sequence analysis and of branch and  bound algorithms to
              problems in combinatorial optimization.  Also   a new look is taken at what it
              means for a problem to be  ``inherently sequential''.
