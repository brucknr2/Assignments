Abstract    :
                   This research, supported by a National Science Foundation                 
              Young Investigator award, will use parametrically and externally               
              excited standing waves to test modern theories in nonlinear                    
              dynamical systems.  It will also investigate the energy transfer               
              among wave modes in spectra with various initial conditions, the               
              effects of surface films on the waves' physics and the boundary                
              condition at a gas-liquid-solid interface.                                     
                   The National Science Foundation Young Investigator award                  
              recognizes outstanding young faculty.  This award recognizes the               
              recipient's strong potential for continued professional growth as              
              a research mathematician and for significant development as a                  
              teacher and academic leader.
