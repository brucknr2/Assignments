Abstract    :
                 The focus of the proposed research is the design and                        
              implementation of autonomous agents-computer programs that have a              
              sustained interaction with a dynamic, incompletely predictable                 
              environment.  Programming such agents is very difficult, largely               
              because the programmer rarely actually knows the correct behavior              
              for the agent.  For example, typically, the programmer ends up                 
              learning, during the debugging process, how the agent's sensors                
              and effectors interact with the environment.  Thus, the agent,                 
              rather than the programmer, should learn this from experience.                 
              This learning, called reinforcement learning, will be                          
              investigated.  In particular, two special problems will be                     
              studied:  that they require the input and output spaces to be                  
              completely enumerated (and have polynomial time complexity) and                
              that they cannot use prior information about the world,                        
              information which ought to be able to speed and deepen the                     
              learning process.
