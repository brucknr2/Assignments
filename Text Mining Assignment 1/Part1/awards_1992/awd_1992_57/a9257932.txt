Abstract    :
              The research deals with reliable stabilization of                              
              control systems when some of the sensors and                                   
              actuators fail in real-time.  Controller                                       
              decomposition is used so that closed-loop stability is                         
              still maintained when one of the controller is no                              
              longer operational.  The work is based on                                      
              characterization of plants which can be stabilized                             
              using decentralized feedback and parameterization                              
              of all stabilizing decentralized controllers.  The                             
              research will also extend factorization theory to the                          
              analysis and synthesis of nonlinear systems, where                             
              general theory is difficult to develop and the                                 
              extensions will be indirect.
