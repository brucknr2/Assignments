Abstract    :
              Tricia A. Ferrett (Carleton College), is the recipient of A NSF                
              Young Investigator award for studies in Experimental Physical                  
              Chemistry. Her project involves the use of synchrotron                         
              radiation to induce fragmentation of small molecules by                        
              excitation of their core electrons. Prof. Ferrett will assemble                
              a time-of-flight mass spectrometer and timing circuitry to                     
              permit simultaneous detection and energy characterization of                   
              two or more fragmentation products. By controlling the incident                
              photon energy and the type of molecule to be irradiated, Prof.                 
              Ferrett will elucidate systematic features of fragmentation                    
              pathways. This is important because excitation of core                         
              electrons as a starting point for fragmentation leads to                       
              different pathways than those activated by low energy photons,                 
              and detailed knowledge of the new pathways translates to an                    
              improved understanding of chemical bonds in general.

              Prof. Tricia A. Ferrett (Carleton College), will use X-rays to                 
              induce small molecules to fall apart. By measuring                             
              simultaneously the energies of several fragments, Prof. Ferrett                
              will develop an increased understanding of the detailed way in                 
              which the absorption of the X-rays leads to molecular                          
              disruption. Particular molecules to be studied are of general                  
              importance in the chemistry of the atmosphere and chemistry at                 
              catalytic surfaces.
