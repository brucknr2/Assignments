Abstract    :
              With this National Science Foundation Young Investigator (NYI)                 
              award, the Synthetic Organic Program of the Chemistry Division                 
              is supporting the research and teaching activities of Dr.                      
              Jeffrey S. Moore of the Department of Chemistry at the                         
              University of Michigan.  The focus of Professor Moore's                        
              research will be the design and synthesis of novel organic                     
              materials using a modular construction approach.  The resulting                
              monolayers on surfaces, ordered fluid phases and                               
              non-close-packed crystals are materials of much current                        
              interest.  In the long term, Dr. Moore will work on the                        
              molecular design of materials for regulating transport                         
              phenomena.  The focus of Dr. Moore's teaching activities will                  
              be the development of a junior/senior level undergraduate                      
              course in materials chemistry and the inclusion of                             
              undergraduates in his research efforts.
