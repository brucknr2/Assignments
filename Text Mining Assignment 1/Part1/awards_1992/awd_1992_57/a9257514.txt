Abstract    :
                   This research entails the development, construction and                   
              testing of an advanced high speed metrology system.  The major                 
              areas to be addressed by this project are:  probe/surface contact              
              dynamics, structural vibration, probe trajectory control, large                
              scale data reduction, and determination of product quality for use             
              in feedback to production systems.  Contact dynamics will be                   
              improved by redesigning the probe's mechanical configuration, and              
              the use of both digital and analog filters.  Probe trajectory                  
              control will be achieved via high speed data acquisition and                   
              processing systems in conjunction with advanced control theory.                
              Structural vibrations generated during a scan will be addressed by             
              using optimally planned trajectories that minimize excitation and              
              by employing typical control strategies for flexible structures                
              such as feed-forward.  Advanced statistical techniques will be used            
              to reduced the large amounts of data generated by the scanning                 
              process.                                                                       
                   The results of the measurements will be used to determine both            
              geometric deviation of the part and the quality level of the part              
              and/or batch of parts being produced.  This will enable users to               
              determine the necessary modifications to machine tool trajectories             
              to generate desired geometries.  The results will also be used to              
              analyze and improve production system capabilities.
