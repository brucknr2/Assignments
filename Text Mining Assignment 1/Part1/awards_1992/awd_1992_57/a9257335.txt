Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Funded under the new National Science Foundation Young                         
              Investigator Award program (NYI), research will be supported                   
              for a combined experimental and numerical simulation approach                  
              to hydrodynamic problems related to river mechanics.  Two main                 
              topics are the initial focus of this research:  experimental                   
              studies of turbulent flow over rough surfaces and turbulence -                 
              sediment interaction, and a numerical simulation of river                      
              channel instabilities beyond the linear perturbation regime.                   
                                                                                             
              The study will provide insight into the mechanics of river                     
              meandering and bank erosion, of great importance to various                    
              environmental issues.
