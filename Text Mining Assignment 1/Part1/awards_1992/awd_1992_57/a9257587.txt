Abstract    :
              Riskin         New ways to use Vector Quantization (VQ) other than strictly  for
              data compression are being investigated, and are being  applied to applications
              such as image processing, halftoning,  progressive transmission, and immunity
              against communication  channel noise.   In many applications, both VQ and many
              image processing  operations are applied to small subblocks of an image. The
              image  processing step can be applied ahead of time to each vector in a  VQ
              codebook, with the processed vectors stored along with the  codebook. If the
              computational complexity of the VQ encoder is  lower than that of the image
              processing step, this reduces the  computational complexity. This approach is
              being applied to  halftoning, edge detection, and histogram equalization.      
                 In a progressive transmission system, the received image is  reconstructed
              as an increasingly better reproduction of the  transmitted image as bits
              arrive. Ways to organize and order a VQ  codebook so that it can be used for
              direct progressive  transmission of full search VQ are being studied.  In an
              ordered  VQ, the VQ codeword index is correlated with the codeword  location in
              the input space. This ordinal mapping feature of  clustering codewords with
              similar indexes to obtain additional  reproduction vectors for the decoder is
              being exploited.   Extentions to progressive transmission of ordered VQ indexes
              over  noisy communication channels are being included.
