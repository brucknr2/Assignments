Abstract    :
                   This NYI award will support the research of a promising and               
              accomplished young investigator.  His research will include a                  
              program of experimental quantum optics and precision measurement               
              with laser-cooled atoms.  Zero-point confinement of neutral atoms              
              will be demonstrated, and the coherence of spontaneous emission                
              investigated.  A new technique for mass and g-factor measurements              
              will also be explored.
