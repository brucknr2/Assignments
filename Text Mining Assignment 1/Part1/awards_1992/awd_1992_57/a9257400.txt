Abstract    :
              This is an NSF Young Investigator award.                                       
              The PI's research will focus in the area of                                    
              solid-state and actuators and integrated                                       
              circuits, as a means to stable, high-                                          
              performance peripherals for electronic systems                                 
              and development of fully integrated                                            
              sensing/actuating systems.  The specific                                       
              research area of focus will be                                                 
              microelectromechanical systems for high-                                       
              performance sensing and actuation devices,                                     
              fabrication technologies for microstructure                                    
              formation and for sensor-actuator-circuit                                      
              integration, design of high-performance                                        
              interface electronics, and definition of high-                                 
              performance packaging techniques.                                              
              Application areas for this research will include                               
              implantable biomedical senors and actuators,                                   
              and sensors and actuators for transportation
