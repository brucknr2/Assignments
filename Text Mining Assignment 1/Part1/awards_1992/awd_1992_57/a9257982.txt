Abstract    :
              Kahng         The unifying theme of this research is that the underlying 
              geometries, embedding dimensions and topological representations  of CAD
              designs, together afford a perspective for effective  algorithm design.  The
              research is in three areas.  1.     Performance-driven synthesis at various
              levels of design,  including clustering for problem decomposition and fast 
              hierarchical placement, and estimation of intrinsic resource  requirements via
              topological criteria.  2.     Assessment of design problem complexity based on
              the  interaction between topology of neighborhood structures and  scaling
              geometry in the associated cost surfaces.  This includes  time-bounded
              stochastic optimizations, and a non-monotone class  of annealing methods.  3.  
                Capturing the underlying physics of high-speed devices and  interconnects
              while maintaining algorithmically tractable  formulations.  Examples are a
              unified routing tree optimization  and the separation of the interconnect
              topology from subsequent  geometric embedding.
