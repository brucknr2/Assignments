Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The research includes studies designed to:  relate rheology of                 
              microphase-separated block copolymers to molecular characteristics;            
              elucidate morphology of polymers with a crystalline block;                     
              understand block copolymer order-order transitions in-situ; to                 
              determine the effect of interfacial mixing on mechanical behavior              
              of two-phase polymer blends, engineer more effective interfaces;               
              prepare new ionomers and ion-containing blends; and to synthesize              
              new biodegradable polyhydroxyalkanoates by microbial fermentation,             
              studying morphology and structure-property relationships.
