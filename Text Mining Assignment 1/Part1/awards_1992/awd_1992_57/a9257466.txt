Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Modern synchrotron x-ray scattering techniques will be employed and            
              evolving structures found in novel condensed matter systems.  The              
              ultimate goal of this research program is to extend our "first                 
              principles" understanding of statistical and solid state phenomena             
              to the realm of inhomogeneous, non-equilibrium systems.
