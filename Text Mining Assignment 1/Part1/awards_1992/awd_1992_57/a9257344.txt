Abstract    :
              This project is an NYI award and is recommended with the                       
              challenge of improving the nation's public works and                           
              infrastructure systems.  Research will include the investigation               
              of new materials, such as fiber composites of all types, epoxy                 
              bonded laminates to concrete surfaces, and their mechanical                    
              properties for potential use in constructed facilities.
