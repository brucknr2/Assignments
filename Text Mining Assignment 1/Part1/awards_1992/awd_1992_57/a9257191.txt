Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  Funds ar provided for Young Investigator Maureen Raymo to                 
              carry out  research on study of deep sea cores to  reconstruct the             
              history of global climate change in the Earth's past. In                       
              particular, the PI will use carbon and oxygen stable isotope data              
              to reconstruct history of ice volume, ocean circulation, and                   
              atmospheric CO2 changes over the last few million years. She will              
              use  these records to understand cause-and-effect linkages between             
              major components of the Earth's climate system.
