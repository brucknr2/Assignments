Abstract    :
              This project examines enzyme structure and mechanism, in                       
              particular those involved in the biosynthesis of tetrapyrroles.                
              This pathway is of fundamental importance to the understanding                 
              of the metabolism of hemes, chlorophylls, corrins and bile                     
              pigments.  5-Aminolevulinate synthase (ALAS) is the first                      
              enzyme involved in the biosynthesis of tetrapyrroles, and the                  
              rate-limiting enzyme of the heme biosynthetic pathway in the                   
              liver.  ALAS is a mitochondrial matrix enzyme and has an                       
              absolute requirement for pyridoxal 5-phosphate (PLP) as a                      
              cofactor, to become an active enzyme.  It is synthesized in the                
              cytosol as a larger precursor protein and imported into the                    
              mitochondria, where it is processed to yield the mature ALAS                   
              protein.  The studies are designed to elucidate the                            
              relationship of the structure and function of ALAS and the                     
              structure (i.e., the folding state) of ALAS precursor form to                  
              its import into the mitochondria.                                              
              %%%                                                                            
              The knowledge obtained from this study is both necessary and                   
              fundamental to achieve an understanding of the structure,                      
              mechanism, and regulation of the enzymes involved in heme                      
              biosynthesis.//
