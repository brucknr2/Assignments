Abstract    :
              Farrens         The research is to investigate various configurations of 
              decoupled architectures and to extend the concept into the field  of parallel
              processing.  It is anticipated that, with several  decoupled processors
              communicating via architectural queues  called Multiple Instruction Stream
              Computer (MISC), it will  function as a type of dynamic superscalar processor,
              providing  significant performance gains.  The MISC architecture uses  multiple
              asynchronous processing elements to separate a program  into streams that can
              be executed in parallel, and integrates a  conflict-free message passing system
              into the lowest level of the  processor design to facilitate low latency
              intra-MISC  communication.  This approach allows for increased machine 
              parallelism with minimal code expansion, and provides an  alternative approach
              to single instruction stream multi-issue  machines such as superscalars and
              VLIWs.         The relationship between optimal processor configuration and 
              transistor count is also being investigated.  The goal is to  define the design
              points at which a change to multiple processors  becomes advantageous.
