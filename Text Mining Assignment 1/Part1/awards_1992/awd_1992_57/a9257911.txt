Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The applicant's research program, in general, involves                         
              understanding the relationship between polymer structure and                   
              properties.  Particular projects involve modifying polymers                    
              for high permeability and mechanical strength, and                             
              investigating the effects of physical and chemical mixing on                   
              permeation, mechanical strength and suprastructure.
