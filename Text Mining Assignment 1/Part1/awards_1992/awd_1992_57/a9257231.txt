Abstract    :
              The research project includes an integrated design/construction                
              research program for infrastructure rehabilitation, with two                   
              research thrusts: (1) analysis, assessment and planning, and (2)               
              implementation and execution of projects.  The primary objective               
              is to develop a conceptual framework and model for producing                   
              innovative and integrated design/construction solutions for                    
              infrastructure rehabilitation problems.
