Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Theory of nonlinear dynamics will be applied to understand pattern             
              formation in fluids and biophysics.  Topical areas under study                 
              include cellular convection, three-dimensional coarsening, DNA                 
              sequence analysis, physics of neural organization and properties of            
              neural networks.
