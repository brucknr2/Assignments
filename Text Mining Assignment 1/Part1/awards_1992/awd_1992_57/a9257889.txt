Abstract    :
                   This research, supported by a National Science Foundation                 
              Young Investigator award, will continue research involving                     
              algebraic geometry and certain fully nonlinear PDEs with the hope              
              of solving the conjecture on the universal bound of the degree of              
              Fano varieties and the Calabi conjecture on the existence of                   
              Kahler-Einstein metrics of positive scalar curvature.                          
                   The National Science Foundation Young Investigator award                  
              recognizes outstanding young faculty.  This award recognizes the               
              recipient's strong potential for continued professional growth as              
              a research mathematician and for significant development as a                  
              teacher and academic leader.
