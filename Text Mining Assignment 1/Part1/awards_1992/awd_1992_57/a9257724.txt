Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  This award provides support to Dr. William Axinn under the                
              National Science Foundation's Young Investigator Awards program.               
              The objective of this program is to recognize outstanding young                
              faculty in science and engineering, to enhance the academic career             
              of recent Ph.D. recipients, and to foster contact and cooperation              
              between academia and industry.  Dr. Axinn has already made                     
              significant research contributions to the field of demography, and             
              he has the potential to become a leader in academic research and               
              education.                                                                     
                   This award will allow the investigator to pursue his research             
              interests in family formation processes in the United States and               
              in Nepal.  Dr. Axinn plans to expand his research on family                    
              formation in the United States.  He will examine the mechanisms                
              through which children's family formation behavior is influenced               
              by their parents' family formation and dissolution experiences, and            
              their educational and financial resources.  He also plans to study             
              intergenerational influences on childbearing decisions.  Dr.                   
              Axinn's work on fertility in Nepal will be aimed at understanding              
              the causes of fertility change in that country.  This research will            
              provide important insights into the processes resulting in                     
              fertility decline in non-industrialized settings.
