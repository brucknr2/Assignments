Abstract    :
              This is an NYI award for FY 92.  This five year research program               
              focuses on the micromechanical material behavior of shape-memory               
              single crystals and on developing an understanding of the role of              
              microstructure in the overall behavior of shape-memory single                  
              crystals.  A primary goal is to build an improved version of a                 
              moire microscope that will allow for the measurement of the                    
              surface deformation field near a crack tip during loading.                     
              Experimental data arising from the application of this device                  
              will be used to formulate models for predicting crack growth in,               
              and subsequent failure of, this potentially important class of                 
              materials.
