Abstract    :
                   This NYI award will support the research of a promising                   
              and accomplished young investigator.  His research will                        
              include an investigation of polarization phenomena in                          
              electronuclear coincidence reactions.  The exploitation of                     
              spin observables allows exploration of small amplitudes and                    
              subtle interference effects and addresses fundamental                          
              questions of this research are the study of the quark                          
              wavefunctions of the proton and a highly sensitive test of a                   
              fundamental symmetry-time reversal invariance.
