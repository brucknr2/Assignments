Abstract    :
              This is an NSF Young Investigator award.  Research covers two                  
              distinct areas of heterogeneous catalysis:  solid bases and                    
              quantum-sized photocatalysts.                                                  
                                                                                             
              The solid bases of interest are primarily metal oxides and                     
              mixed metal oxides with surface areas in excess of 200 square                  
              meters per gram.  These are studied in both supported and                      
              unsupported form to examine the influence of carrier structure                 
              on reactivity.  Zeolite-occluded oxides are also under study.                  
              The overall aim is to understand how the oxide surface                         
              structure stabilizes anionic intermediates during a catalytic                  
              cycle; the approach is to correlate catalyst synthesis with                    
              atomic structure, adsorption, and chemical reactivity.                         
              Principal techniques used are Fourier-transform infrared                       
              spectroscopy of surface intermediates, temperature-programmed                  
              desorption and reaction of probe molecules, and steady-state                   
              reaction studies, including isotopic labelling.                                
                                                                                             
              Nanometer-sized semiconductor clusters exhibit unusually high                  
              quantum efficiencies for photocatalytic activity compared to                   
              bulk-phase material.  Exploratory studies with supported                       
              titania and other photocatalysts are performed with the goal                   
              of creating a selective hydrocarbon  oxidation catalyst by                     
              incorporating the photoactive material onto a carrier capable                  
              of molecular discrimination and orientation.  Zeolites and                     
              related materials are suitable candidates for such a carrier.                  
              Materials are characterized by laser Raman spectroscopy,                       
              ultraviolet diffuse reflectance spectroscopy, and X-ray                        
              absorption spectroscopy.  Adsorption studies and steady-state                  
              photocatalytic oxidation reactions are used to probe the                       
              surface reactivity of these novel materials.//
