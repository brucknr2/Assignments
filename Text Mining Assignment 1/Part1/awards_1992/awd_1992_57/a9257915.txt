Abstract    :
              The goal of this research is to investigate novel nonequilibrium               
              alloying technique for developing lightweight materials with                   
              enhanced strength and corrosion resistance.  Specifically,                     
              magnesium and aluminum alloyed with additional transitional                    
              elements such as Cr, Mo, Ta, and W will be considered.  Layered                
              vapor deposits, or graded structures, will be produced using                   
              these materials as a means of producing bulk alloys with enhanced              
              properties.  The research will build upon early work on passive                
              film structure and the role of non-crystallinity, chemistry and                
              defect structure on passivity and mechanisms responsible for                   
              enhancement in mechanical properties at high temperatures.
