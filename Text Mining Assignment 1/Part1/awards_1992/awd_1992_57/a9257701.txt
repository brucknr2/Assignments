Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This is an N.S.F. Young Investigator Award. Dr. Levin plans to                 
              examine the role played by hormones in the development of sex                  
              differences in bird song in a tropical species in which both                   
              sexes sing. She also proposes to investigate the possibility that              
              environmental factors such as latitude may affect the degree to                
              which hormones control adult song.
