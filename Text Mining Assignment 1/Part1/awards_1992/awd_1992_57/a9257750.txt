Abstract    :
              Research in this laboratory deals with microorganisms that                     
              metabolize xenobiotic compounds, especially aromatic hydrocarbons.             
              New microbial strains that have diverse capability in terms of                 
              their ability to degrade different aromatic hydrocarbons will be               
              isolated by various enrichment culture techniques.  Emphasis is on             
              obtaining novel strains that have the ability to degrade a wide                
              range of related compounds.  The metabolic pathway(s) by which the             
              aromatic hydrocarbon is degraded will be determined by standard                
              biochemical assays and analytical techniques.  Unique enzymes                  
              showing varied capability will be isolated and characterized.  The             
              genes involved in the pathway will be cloned and sequence.  Site-              
              directed mutagenesis will be utilized to explore the molecular                 
              basis for enzyme structure/function.  The regulatory control                   
              mechanisms for the various steps of the metabolic pathway will be              
              analyzed at the molecular level.  New recombinant strains will be              
              constructed that involve  multiple genes from various sources.  The            
              goal of these genetically constructed strains is to metabolize as              
              wide a range of compounds as possible and as efficiently as                    
              possible.  Currently the laboratory is focusing on polycyclic                  
              aromatic hydrocarbons, phthalate and phthalate esters, and                     
              substituted benzenes (chlorobenzene, toluene, and nitrobenzene).               
              %%%                                                                            
              This project on aromatic hydrocarbon degradation is environmentally            
              important in toxic waste removal.  Understanding of the complex                
              metabolic pathway for degradation of these compounds will aid in               
              improving biodegradability.
