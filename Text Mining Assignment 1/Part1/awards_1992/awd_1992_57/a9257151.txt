Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  This award provides support to Dr. Yu Xie under the National              
              Science Foundation's Young Investigator Awards program.  The                   
              objective of this program is to recognize outstanding young faculty            
              in science and engineering, to enhance the academic career of                  
              recent Ph.D. recipients, and to foster contact and cooperation                 
              between academia and industry.  Dr. Xie has already made                       
              significant research contributions to the fields of sociology and              
              demography, and he has the potential to become a leader in academic            
              research and education.                                                        
                   This award will allow the investigator to pursue his research             
              interests in the sociology of science and in the development of                
              statistical methods for the social sciences.  Dr. Xie plans to                 
              continue his research on the causes of women's underrepresentation             
              in science.  This research is based on longitudinal data for high              
              school students, recent college graduates and experienced                      
              scientists and engineers.  A related research interest of Dr. Xie's            
              is the social determinants of academic achievement in mathematics              
              and science among high school students and the reasons for the                 
              relatively low achievement of students in the United States                    
              compared with other developed countries.  Dr. Xie also plans to                
              continue his work on statistical methodology and demographic                   
              techniques.  He will develop models for analyzing event history                
              data with fewer restrictions than currently available model, and               
              he plans to develop new models for comparing social mobility across            
              nations and time.
