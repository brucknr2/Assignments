Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The applicant's research program, in general, involves                         
              elucidating the relationship between molecular structure and                   
              material property by using molecular orbital theory to obtain                  
              interaction potentials, and statistical mechanical/molecular                   
              dynamics simulations to describe larger scale interactions of                  
              molecular assemblies.  The results will be applied to                          
              polymer/metal adhesion, selective separations mediated by                      
              complexation, sorption and transport in zeolites and alkane                    
              activation on transition metal surfaces.
