Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The research to be undertaken includes:  ultrastructural studies of            
              solid polymers and polymer composites including dislocations,                  
              disclinations, and grain boundaries; thermodynamics and kinetics of            
              phase transitions; the organization of macromolecules near surfaces            
              and interfaces; molecular mechanisms of plastic deformation; and               
              morphology of synthetic poly(peptides).
