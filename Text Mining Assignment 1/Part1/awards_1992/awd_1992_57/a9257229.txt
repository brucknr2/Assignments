Abstract    :
              This NYI award will fund research                                              
              in the area of computer simulation                                             
              of human movement.  The research                                               
              will focus on methods to scale                                                 
              nominal models of the lower limbs                                              
              to arrive at accurate estimates of                                             
              the moment arms of various sized                                               
              individuals.  The predictions will                                             
              be verified using cadaver                                                      
              measurements.  Similar scaling                                                 
              studies for children will be based                                             
              on MRI measurements and also                                                   
              verified through cadaver studies.                                              
              These scaling studies are important                                            
              since movement simulations require                                             
              accurate estimates of moment arms.                                             
              The model also will be used to                                                 
              simulate a number of surgeries                                                 
              including tendon transfers,                                                    
              osteotomies, and joint                                                         
              replacements.                                                                  
                                                                                             
              The NYI award also will help the
