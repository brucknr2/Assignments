Abstract    :
                 This research emphasizes interaction control and reflex control             
              in autonomous systems.  Physical interaction with the environment              
              (e.g., opening doors; moving obstructions; complying with                      
              mechanical constraints) is a key ingredient of reactive autonomous             
              systems, and impedance control will be furthered to provide such               
              behavior.  In particular, stable and "gentle" manipulation                     
              behaviors will be investigated and constructed using principals of             
              passive physical equivalents.  The target resulting behavior should            
              achieve stable interaction among any number of independently-                  
              controlled machines.  Such physical behavior will provide a                    
              suitable platform for investigation of reflex-like, higher-level               
              controllers.  Reflex controllers, like conventional control                    
              systems, generate commands based on sensory inputs.  Unlike                    
              traditional control, though, reflex-like responses invoke logic-               
              based and switched-mode actions that cannot be analyzed in the                 
              traditional terms of linear superposition of inputs or outputs.                
              Use of such nonlinear control constructions has proven highly                  
              valuable in understanding control in biological creatures, though              
              such control is inadequately understood to be applied to machines.             
              In this research, biological stimulus/response behaviors will be               
              mimicked in constructing computer controls for the purpose of                  
              experimentally investigating stability properties and design                   
              techniques for behavior-based systems. //
