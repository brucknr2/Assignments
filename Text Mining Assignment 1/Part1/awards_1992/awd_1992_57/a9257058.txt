Abstract    :
                   This NYI award will support the research of a promising and               
              accomplished young investigator.  His research will include a                  
              study of the interactions between optically trapped atoms.                     
              Excitation of the cold atoms by tunable lasers during collisions               
              will give detailed information about the unique dynamics of these              
              excited-state collisions.  Modification of interatomic forces by               
              non linear and quantum-optical effects will be investigated in                 
              optically thick trapped-atom samples.
