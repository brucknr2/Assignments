Abstract    :
                This is a National Science Foundation Young Investigator Award.              
              The goal of Dr. Henson's laboratory is to investigate the molecular            
              mechanism of cell shape changes and microfilament and microtubule              
              based motility in an invertebrate blood cell (the coelomocyte).                
              Cytoskeletal associated proteins will be isolated, characterized,              
              and localized in the cells using light and electron microscopic                
              immunocytochemical methods.  The regulation of shape changes by                
              calcium will also be addressed.

              This is a National Science Foundation Young Investigator Award.                
              Dr. Henson is interested in the fundamental and important question             
              of how cells change their shapes.  Cellular shape changes are                  
              critical to cellular functions (including movement) and organismal             
              development.  Dr. Henson is currently using sea urchin coelomocytes            
              as models for studying shape changes associated with cellular                  
              motility.  These cells are analogous to white blood cells of higher            
              animals, and their ability to change shape is critical to the                  
              ability of sea urchins to defend themselves against microbial                  
              pathogens.
