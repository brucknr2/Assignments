Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Basic theoretical studies of fluid membranes will be undertaken.               
              Besides their intrinsic scientific challenge, membranes are also               
              important in biology and in the development of advanced materials.             
              Fluid membranes also provide unique opportunities to study                     
              fundamental properties of two-dimensional ordering and phase                   
              transitions in flat and curved geometries.
