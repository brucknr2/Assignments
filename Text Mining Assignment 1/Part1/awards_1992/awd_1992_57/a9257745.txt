Abstract    :
              The proposed research will focus on helix-helix interactions, the              
              connecting loops and RNA recognition.  The protein to be used for              
              the proposed studies is called Rop.  The function of Rop is to                 
              regulate the copy number of the plasmid ColE1 in E. coli.  Rop is              
              attractive for a variety of reasons:  it can be readily over                   
              expressed and purified in large amounts from E. coli; it has no co-            
              factors, disulfide bonds or proline residues; its x-ray crystal                
              structure is known at high resolution; its proton NMR spectrum has             
              been assigned; its stability can be determined in vitro by heat or             
              denaturant induced unfolding (monitored by circular dichroism or               
              differential scanning calorimetry); in vitro gel shift assays, with            
              single stem-loop pairs, can be used to determine RNA binding                   
              affinity; its in vivo function can be exploited.                               
              %%%                                                                            
              As a result of the proposed research Dr. Regan will obtain some                
              very interesting novel proteins and it will be important to obtain             
              more detailed structural information about them.
