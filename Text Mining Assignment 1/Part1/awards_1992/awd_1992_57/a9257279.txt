Abstract    :
              Yang         This research is on modeling and simulation of mixed 
              analog/digital circuit designs.  Topics include:  1.     Hierarchical modeling
              and simulation of tightly coupled,  mixed digital circuits;  2.     Simulation
              of high-performance circuits with complex  nonlinear and electromagnetic
              effects;  3.     Modeling and simulation of optoelectronic integrated 
              circuits, with the focus on automatic model generation;  4.     Development of
              a technique for fast power waveform  simulation based on analytic digital
              macromodeling, which makes  the method well suited to simulating circuit
              netlists derived  from layout extraction;  5.     Fast simulation of
              interconnect problems using asymptotic  waveform evaluation so as to obtain
              efficiency and accuracy in  approximating nonlinear portions of the circuit. 
              Algorithms for  solving these problems, including methods for simulating
              designs  with over 100,000 transistors, are being developed.
