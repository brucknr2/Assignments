Abstract    :
              David Beratan is supported by an NSF Young Investigator Award                  
              in the Theoretical and Computational Chemistry Program to study                
              electron transfer in complex chemical systems.  Beratan's                      
              research will be focused in two primary areas: 1) studies of                   
              electronic interactions in proteins and nucleic acids as an                    
              approach to the design of new electron transfer proteins; and                  
              2) the rational design of new materials with exotic optical and                
              transport properties.  Beratan will employ computational                       
              approaches to rational molecular design which are based on                     
              structure-function relationships.

              Chemists are now attempting to design optical, magnetic, and                   
              superconducting materials starting at the molecular level.                     
              Much of this work involves the use of computer models which                    
              capture the essential physics of the phenomenon of interest.                   
              The work which is being performed by David Beratan will help                   
              to improve our understanding of these physical phenomena,                      
              the physical models which simulate the desired molecular                       
              behavior, and the application of these computational models                    
              to the design of new materials.
