Abstract    :
                 Shape is an important cue in rcognizing objects in pictures.                
              Shape is, however, difficult to describe and use in computer                   
              programs for object recognition, because objects appear different              
              in images taken from different viewpoints.  This effect is                     
              particularly pronounced for curved three-dimensional objects.                  
              Recent work has shown that, for some surfaces, it is possible to               
              compute descriptions that draw only on information from  a single              
              picture, and are the same for every possible view of a given                   
              surface.  These invariant descriptors instantly identify an object,            
              up to a known ambiguity.  This research investigates advance                   
              systems for object recognition that use a combination of invariant             
              descriptors and color information to recognize curved three-                   
              dimensional objects, drawn from a large number of known examples,              
              in pictures taken from an unknown viewing position.//
