Abstract    :
              This National Science Foundation Young Investigator project is in              
              the general area of analytical and surface chemistry and in the                
              subfields of spectroscopy and numerical analysis.  During the                  
              tenure of this five-year award, Professor Lodder and his students              
              will utilize near infrared spectrometry, acoustic resonance                    
              spectrometry, and supercomputer-based numerical methods in                     
              carrying out nondestructive analyses across a broad front of                   
              disciplines.  Included among these are imaging of subsurface paint             
              layers for the restoration of art objects, rapid identification of             
              consumer product tampering, development of nonparametric                       
              algorithms for near infrared three-dimensional imaging, and                    
              development of optical multicomponent reagent-free methods of                  
              analysis for biological fluids.                                                
              %%%                                                                            
              The successful attainment of the goals of this project should                  
              advance non-instrumentation intensive methods of analysis and add              
              significantly to our arsenal of broadly applicable analytical                  
              protocols.  Additionally, this NSF Young Investigator Award should             
              significantly assist Professor Lodder in his establishing a vital              
              and productive program of research and research training.
