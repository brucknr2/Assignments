Abstract    :
                   This NYI award will support the research of a promising and               
              accomplished young investigator.  Her research will include a                  
              study of many aspects of particle model building and                           
              phenomenology, including the mechanism of electroweak symmetry                 
              breaking, the origin and consequences of flavor structure, and                 
              the manifestations and potential sources of CP violation.  It                  
              directly addresses present and future experimental studies at                  
              Fermilab, LEP, SSC, and LHC.
