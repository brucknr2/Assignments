Abstract    :
                   This NYI award will support the research of a promising and               
              accomplished young investigator.  His research will include the                
              use of a silicon vertex detector (SVX) in the CDF experiment at                
              Fermilab to study the b-quark, and search for the t-quark.  The                
              enhanced signal-to-noise derived from the SVX vertex information               
              will provide unique capabilities for b-quark physics and play an               
              essential role in extracting signals for t-quark production.
