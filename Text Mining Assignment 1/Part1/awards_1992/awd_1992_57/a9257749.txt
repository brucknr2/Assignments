Abstract    :
              Dr Zuk will be researching the role of parasites in sexual                     
              selection.  There are two projects involved in this research                   
              effort. The first involves study of conflicting selection                      
              pressures in a field cricket subject to an acoustically-orienting              
              parasitoid fly.  The second project examines the relationship                  
              between sex hormones, parasite burden as reflected in immune                   
              response, and sexual selection in red jungle fowl.  Dr. Zuk will               
              expose undergraduate and graduate students to current research                 
              from a variety of areas within ecology and evolution, with                     
              particular commitment increasing the representation of women and               
              minorities in the sciences.
