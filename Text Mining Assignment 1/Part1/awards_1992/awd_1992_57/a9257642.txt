Abstract    :
              The objective of this research is to develop new geotechnolgies                
              (i.e. Piezo-vibrocone penetrometer) and integrate recent research              
              and development technologies (i.e. high-energy plasma arc torch)               
              into the practices of civil, environmental, and earthquake                     
              engineering. The implementation of these devices will provide                  
              significant improvements in our understanding of earthquake-                   
              induced liquefaction behavior, environmental containment of                    
              wastes, and ground modification techniques.
