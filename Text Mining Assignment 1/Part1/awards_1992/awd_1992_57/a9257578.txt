Abstract    :
                 The construction of knowledge-based systems is extremely                    
              labor-intensive.  Unfortunately, current tools for building                    
              knowledge-based systems do not allow developers to take significant            
              advantage of previous knowledge bases when building new systems.               
              The research supported by this award involves design of a novel                
              architecture for the construction of knowledge-based systems.  The             
              architecture allows system builders either to select an existing               
              problem-solving method from a library, or to construct a new                   
              problem-solving method from a set of predefined building blocks.               
              The developer then maps the data requirements of the                           
              problem-solving method to elements of reusable domain ontologies               
              that define models of particular application areas.  Both the                  
              domain ontologies and the problem-solving methods that are used to             
              build knowledge-based systems are stored in libraries that future              
              developers can access when implementing new applications.  The                 
              research thus addresses strategies to index and retrieve                       
              problem-solving methods and domain ontologies, and to integrate                
              these components within new problem-solving frameworks.  The                   
              research will allow construction of new classes of tools for                   
              building knowledge-based systems, and will define an infrastructure            
              that supports the reuse of knowledge-base components at                        
              increasingly high levels of abstraction.
