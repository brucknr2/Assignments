Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This National Science Foundation Young Investigator Award will                 
              support the identification, observation, and measurement of                    
              planetary nebulae in galaxies other than our own.  The principal               
              investigator, Dr. Robin Ciardullo, will use these observations to              
              study the large scale motions in these galaxies, study the late                
              stages of stellar evolution, and determine a better calibrated                 
              distance scale for the Universe.
