Abstract    :
                   This NYI award will support the research of a promising and               
              accomplished young investigator.  His research will include                    
              research and development of Gas Microstrip Detectors for use in                
              Elementary Particle Physics experiments at the SSC and B                       
              factories, and analysis of data obtained with these detectors,                 
              particularly decays of the b quark at the Cornell Electron                     
              Storage Ring.
