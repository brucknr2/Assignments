Abstract    :
              Dr. Chi Mak is supported by an NSF Young Investigator Award                    
              from the Theoretical and Computational Chemistry Program to                    
              perform theoretical studies of tunneling processes in                          
              condensed phase systems.  Mak will employ a spin-boson model                   
              which involves a two-state system coupled to a harmonic bath                   
              as a primary model for dissipative tunneling reactions.                        
              This model system has been chosen as one which embodies the                    
              essence of the physical contents of the real system, but at                    
              the same time retains sufficient simplicity to be tractable.                   
              Mak will employ this model to study: 1) aqueous electron                       
              transfer reactions; 2) light particle diffusion in solids;                     
              and 3) quantum electron devices.                                               
              %%%                                                                            
              A number of important chemical processes and materials                         
              properties depend on a phenomenon known as quantum                             
              tunneling.  Biological reactions which involve electron                        
              transfer, the diffusion of hydrogen atoms through metals,                      
              and the operation of electronic devices such as the resonant                   
              tunneling diode and the quantum interference transistor are                    
              all examples of phenomena which involve quantum tunneling.                     
              The theoretical studies performed by Dr. Mak will enhance                      
              our understanding of these molecular processes, and help us to                 
              put that understanding to use in designing new materials with                  
              important chemical and physical properties.
