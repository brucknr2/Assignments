Abstract    :
              My research will include two thrusts (1) 2D vertical-                          
              cavity laser arrays with ultrahigh                                             
              (terahertz)bandwidths for optical communications,                              
              interconnections among computers, and real-time                                
              optical signal processing, (2) Aluminum-free lasers                            
              to achieve high reliability for applications in optical-                       
              pumping and optoelectronic integration.  Specific                              
              work includes the design, fabrication and theoretical                          
              analysis of novel devices and examination of                                   
              systems implementations.
