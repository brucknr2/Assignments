Abstract    :
              A programs of research to study novel                                          
              optoelectronic devices based on II-V semiconductor                             
              heterostructures is described.  The devices include                            
              quantum cylinder surface emitting lasers, MSM                                  
              photodetectors, and quantum well inter-subband                                 
              transition-based devices.  The research includes a                             
              component for the study of new, wide band gap                                  
              photonic materials.  The materials system to be                                
              studied is based on the III-V nitrides, with                                   
              (in,Ga,Al)N as an example.
