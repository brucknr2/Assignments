Abstract    :
              With this National Science Foundation Young Investigator (NYI)                 
              award, the Synthetic Organic Program of the Chemistry Division                 
              is supporting the research and teaching activities of Dr. Craig                
              A. Merlic of the Department of Chemistry at the University of                  
              California, Los Angeles.  The focus of Professor Merlic's                      
              research will be the study of organometallic radical reactions.                
              The chemistry of polyenyl organic radicals bonded to transition                
              metal fragments will be investigated to develop new synthetic                  
              organic reactions and to understand the nature of                              
              organometallic radical intermediates.  The focus of Dr.                        
              Merlic's teaching activities will be on course and laboratory                  
              curriculum development in organic chemistry at both the                        
              undergraduate and graduate level.
