Abstract    :
              The proposed research is in the area of exploring                              
              and analyzing new computational algorithms for the                             
              dynamic security assessment of large power                                     
              systems.  To be investigated are the interactions                              
              between stressed highly nonlinear,                                             
              discrete/continuous systems (modelled by mixed                                 
              differential/algebraic equations) and the numerical                            
              methods used to analyze system behavior.  The                                  
              inclusion of discrete controls and limiters are                                
              known to cause numerical instabilities.  The study                             
              of numerical robustness and error detection of                                 
              computational algorithms of ill-conditioned systems                            
              is increasingly important as system descriptions                               
              become more realistic and complex.  The                                        
              interaction of system structure, numerical                                     
              robustness and problem conditioning, must be                                   
              better understood for these more complex models.
