Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This research focuses on the effects of alloy content on the                   
              mechanical behavior of intermetallic materials.  It is expected the            
              results of this research will be an advancement in the scientific              
              understanding of these materials, allowing alloy designers to                  
              optimize their mechanical properties and unlock their true                     
              potential.
