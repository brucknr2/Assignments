Abstract    :
              This NSF Young Investigator grant from the Organic Dynamics                    
              Program supports the work of Professor Thomas C. Pochapsky at                  
              Brandeis University.  The structure and dynamics of                            
              self-assembling systems will be determined using NMR and                       
              chromatographic techniques.  Two-dimensional NMR techniques                    
              will be used to determine the structures of putidaredoxin and                  
              closely related analogues prepared by site-directed                            
              mutagenesis.  Other biological macromolecules that will be                     
              investigated include a chimeric protein created by replacing a                 
              four-residue tight turn in interleukin-1-beta with the                         
              ten-residue trypsin binding loop from alpha-1-antitrypsin.  Ion                
              pair structure will be investigated by measuring inter-ion pair                
              NOE's.                                                                         
              %%%                                                                            
              The three dimensional structure of proteins will be determined                 
              by using a spectroscopic tool which gives a response which can                 
              be related to the distance between pairs of atomic nuclei.                     
              Distance data for several pairs of nuclei greatly restrict the                 
              possible solution geometry of the protein and in many cases                    
              provide a unique structure.  This work will provide important                  
              information necessary to understand the forces which control                   
              molecular self-assembly.
