Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The goal of this research is to understand how forces between                  
              molecules and between molecules and the surfaces of covalently                 
              bonded solids control the fundamental nature of reactive processes             
              involved in the growth of electronic materials (e.g. Si, GaAs, InP,            
              Diamond).
