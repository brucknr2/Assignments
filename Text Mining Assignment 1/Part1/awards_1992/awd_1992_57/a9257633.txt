Abstract    :
              During the period of NYI award, experience in system                           
              identification and the related applications of modeling, control               
              and verification will be employed to investigate complex multi-                
              degree-of-freedom systems that exhibit nonlinear behavior. the                 
              ultimate goal of the   project is to produce viable approaches                 
              for identification and control of such systems, and to                         
              demonstrate and evaluate their performance. Identification                     
              performance indicators will be developed as part of the                        
              investigation. Contacts with industries will be used to define                 
              appropriate simulation and laboratory systems.***//
