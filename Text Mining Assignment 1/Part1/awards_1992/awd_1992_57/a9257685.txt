Abstract    :
              Dr. Lorraine Pillus has provided general support for her studies of            
              positional control of gene expression in yeast.  Her research                  
              program is directed toward understanding the molecular basis for               
              control of gene expression and cell identity.  She is using the                
              combined techniques of biochemistry, cell biology and genetics to              
              examine the assembly and inheritance of transcriptionally repressed            
              states of cell type information.  In addition, she is attempting to            
              identify functional correlates of the yeast genes in vertebrates               
              using a yeast assay system, as well as identifying signals and                 
              targets in yeast controlling the germination of yeast spores.                  
              %%%                                                                            
              The ultimate goal of this research is to understand molecular                  
              mechanisms for establishing and maintaining transcriptionally                  
              inactive regions in the chromosomes of dividing cells.  Because the            
              position effect that is the focus of these experiments involves a              
              heterochromatic structure of chromatin, the results of these                   
              studies will bear on the genetic control of imprinting and on the              
              structure of eukaryotic chromosomes.
