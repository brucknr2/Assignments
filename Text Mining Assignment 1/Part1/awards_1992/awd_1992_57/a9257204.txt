Abstract    :
              Two projects are being proposed.  The first is in the                          
              area of robust estimation theory as applied to                                 
              power systems.  Security monitoring and control of                             
              an electric power system depend on a reliable data                             
              base.  Unfortunately, in a typical power system                                
              there are bad measurements, parameter errors,                                  
              and/or topology errors.  The present industry                                  
              practice is to use a weighted least squares approach                           
              which has no tolerance for large errors and                                    
              frequently fails.  In this connection robust                                   
              estimation theory has advantages but work needs to                             
              be done to make the method practical.  Among                                   
              these are the need to further the extension of the                             
              theory to sparse matrices and to determine                                     
              appropriate "high breakdown point"  estimators.                                
              Other issues to be addressed include real-time                                 
              estimation and optimal sensor location.                                        
              The second area of research concerns the use of                                
              real-time phasor measurements for voltage and                                  
              transient stability monitoring and control, including                          
              dynamic security analysis and automatic control                                
              during an emergency state of a power system.
