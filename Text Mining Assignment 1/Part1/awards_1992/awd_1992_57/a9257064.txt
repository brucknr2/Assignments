Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The goals of this research are to identify and describe molecular              
              processes governing the macroscopic properties of advanced                     
              catalysts, optical devices, and polymeric solids.  Emphasis will be            
              placed on application of state-of-the-art methods in NMR                       
              spectroscopy to describe quantitatively local bonding, symmetry,               
              and motions in partially ordered molecular sieve and polymeric                 
              systems.
