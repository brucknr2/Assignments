Abstract    :
              The research encompasses hot structure analysis and mechanics of               
              composite materials.  Under hot structure analysis, failure                    
              theories will be developed for materials and structures subjected              
              to severe thermo-mechanical loadings including the effects of                  
              thermal shock, chemical changes and phase transformations.                     
              Undercomposite mechanics, smart materials will be considered                   
              including their behavior, processing and applications.
