Abstract    :
                This project investigates image signatures which are compact                 
              representation of images. The research focuses on the investigation            
              of different neural network architectures, such as backpropagation             
              or cascade-correlation, for their capability to generate image                 
              signatures. The project is based on two ideas. One idea is to use              
              the notion of atomic images (images containing one object) and                 
              their corresponding atomic signatures, as well as composite images             
              (images containing more than one object) and their composite                   
              signatures. Another idea is to train neural networks on atomic                 
              images and/or their signatures and then to have such networks to               
              recognize arbitrary composition of atomic images and/or their                  
              signatures. The results of this research will form the foundations             
              for an efficient access of images in databases and retrieval of                
              images by their content.
