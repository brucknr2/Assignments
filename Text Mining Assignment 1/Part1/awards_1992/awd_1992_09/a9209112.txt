Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  Age dating of rocks from manson crater in central Iowa                    
              indicates that this crater was formed in the same time frame as the            
              K/T boundary, and the impacted strata are of the correct                       
              compositions to have generated the shocked minerals found in the               
              boundary clay layer worldwide, but most abundantly and of the                  
              largest grain sizes in the North American boundary clays.  Although            
              Ar40/Ar39 dating places the crater age at 65.7+1 m.y., a 4-sample              
              paleomagnetic study reported the crater rocks to have only normal              
              polarity magnetization.  Because the K/T boundary is found                     
              worldwide in a reversed polarity interval, the normal polarity                 
              results have led to the inference by some that the Manson impact               
              did not happen at the K/T boundary.  However, the study was                    
              exceedingly small, and moreover, the samples displayed some                    
              ambiguous magnetization behavior.  This study involves a two-fold              
              paleomagnetic study of the rocks in Manson Crater to determine the             
              polarity and age of magnetization.  First is a detailed study of               
              the magnetization of the impact breccia.  Both the matrix magneti-             
              zation and a "conglomerate test" of the clast magnetizations                   
              potentially can reveal the polarity of the geomagnetic field at the            
              time of the Manson impact, hence whether or not the crater was                 
              formed in the same polarity as the K/T boundary.  Further the                  
              magnetostratigraphy of the post-impact, as well as the pre-impact              
              sedimentary sequences will be studied to further narrow the age                
              range of the impact event.   The magnetostratigraphy study also has            
              the potential to narrow the uncertainty of the radiometrically                 
              determined age of Manson crater from 2 m.y. to less than 0.5 m.y.              
              It is important to determine whether the Manson impact is an                   
              indication that the K/T boundary phenomena are the result of                   
              multiple impacts.
