Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This project supports the dissertation research of a cultural                  
              anthropologist studying the enculturation of children as                       
              consumers in an eastern city (New Haven).  Ten-year old children               
              from a middle class and a poor neighborhood will be studied                    
              through focus groups, observations of individual play sessions,                
              structured interviews with children and parents, and participant               
              observation.                                                                   
                                                                                             
              This study's contribution to the understanding of consumption                  
              will be in documenting the process of children's enculturation as              
              consumers, by studying children as active participants in the                  
              process of learning consumer-related skills.  As a study of one                
              case in the world's largest consumer society, this project will                
              help us understand the ways people become consumption-oriented,                
              which can help us design programs and policies to moderate the                 
              excesses of consumption.
