              The objectives of the project are:

              further to reveal more design

              Thus an optimal control formulation                                            
              will be used to generalize

              research will use a design option                                              
              that buffers against the effects of

              third phase will propose fast

              phase will perform a qualitative                                               
              analysis for some of the systems
