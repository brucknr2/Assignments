Abstract    :
                 Deductive databases provide a declarative framework based on                
              first-order logic for writing queries.  Entries in the database                
              define the answer to a query without indicating how to answer the              
              query.  By allowing recursion, deductive databases yield higher                
              expressive power than classical relational databases.  The two                 
              main problems addressed in this project are semantics and                      
              optimization. This research studies semantics for deductive                    
              databases extended with aggregate operators such as ``minimum''                
              and ``sum.''  Extensions of such semantics to programs with                    
              second-order constructs are also considered.  The project is                   
              assessing how effectively second-order features can be                         
              incorporated into present-day relational databases.  Optimization              
              techniques for deductive databases with aggregates, both new                   
              techniques and extensions of existing strategies are also                      
              be investigated. This project will contribute fundamental                      
              knowledge about how to provide declarative features, such as                   
              aggregation and second-order constructs, within deductive                      
              databases.
