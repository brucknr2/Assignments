Abstract    :
              The National Bureau of Economic Research Summer Institute brings               
              together economists from universities, government and                          
              international organizations for a few days or a weeks of                       
              seminars, workshops, conferences, and collaborative research.                  
              Last year's Summer Institute included 709 economists from 179                  
              universities.  A similar number is expected to attend this                     
              summer.  Special efforts are made to include younger and less                  
              well known economists.                                                         
                                                                                             
              The Summer Institute is organized into 12 programs: economic                   
              fluctuations, monetary economics, corporate finance, asset                     
              pricing, industrial organization, health and aging, international              
              studies, labor studies, productivity, and taxation.  Each                      
              program has its own group of participants and its own structure.               
              Although there is considerable variation among the programs, a                 
              typical Summer Institute will last for one to three weeks, with                
              seminars each morning and afternoons devoted to individual                     
              research.  Programs may include a variety of subjects or they may              
              be organized around specific topics.                                           
                                                                                             
              The Institute provides a unique opportunity for economists to                  
              work closely with others in their areas of specialty for extended              
              and intense periods research.  Although numerous conferences                   
              permit researchers a few hours in which to exchange ideas, only                
              this institute lasts long enough to allow for serious                          
              collaboration among economists from different institutions.                    
              While research nearing completion is presented, the major                      
              emphasis is placed on testing new ideas by presenting preliminary              
              research and developing ideas and plans for joint or coordinated               
              research efforts.
