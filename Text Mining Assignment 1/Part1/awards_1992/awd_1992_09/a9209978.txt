Abstract    :
                   Theoretical research in elementary particle theory will                   
              focus on string theory, solvable quantum field theories, and                   
              quantum groups.  String theory is the only known consistent                    
              framework for the unified description of all elementary                        
              particles and forces, so further progress in this theory is                    
              quite important.  The work on solvable field theories and                      
              quantum groups can improve our understanding of the                            
              mathematical structures that describe the elementary                           
              particles.
