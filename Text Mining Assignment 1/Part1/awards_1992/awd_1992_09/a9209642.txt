Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Words with more than one meaningful part can be described in two               
              ways: as independent lexical items or as the result of a rule                  
              that combines two morphemes into a single word.  Recent                        
              approaches without morphological rules describe morphological                  
              patterns as phonological generalizations over a set of forms.                  
              Such proposals have two consequences:  (1) regularly inflected                 
              forms may be stored in the lexicon, and (2) phonological factors               
              should influence morphological processing.                                     
                                                                                             
              The aim of the research project is to examine these consequences               
              using experiments-induced speech errors in three tasks:  SLIPS                 
              (for phonological errors), morphonaming (for morphological errors              
              where an inflected form is the target), and embedding (for                     
              morphological errors where the base form is the target).  The                  
              results may demonstrate that non-rule-based approaches are                     
              unworkable, if they show that regular forms are not stored in the              
              lexicon or that phonological factors cannot underlie                           
              morphological effects.  However, if the results show that regular              
              forms are stored and that phonological factors could underlie                  
              morphological effects, then non-rule-based approaches will still               
              be workable.
