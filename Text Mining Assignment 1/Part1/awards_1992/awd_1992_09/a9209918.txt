Abstract    :
                   Research in theoretical physics will explore the                          
              implications of unification models of elementary particle                      
              physics for astrophysics and cosmology.  Empirical evidence                    
              shows that there is considerable non-luminous, or "dark"                       
              matter in the universe.  Preliminary work completed on                         
              hypothesized self-interacting dark matter indicates that this                  
              new type of dark matter has properties intermediate between                    
              the conventional "hot" and "cold" dark matter categories.                      
              Thus it may represent an improvement over conventional dark                    
              matter candidates while still satisfying the constraints                       
              imposed by primordial nucleosynthesis, velocities in galactic                  
              halos, and observations of the diffuse extragalactic                           
              background radiation in the soft x-ray region.  This project                   
              will perform a more detailed analysis of this type of dark                     
              matter.  Since the nature of the dark matter is one of the                     
              outstanding puzzles in astrophysics, investigations of various                 
              possible types of dark matter are very important.
