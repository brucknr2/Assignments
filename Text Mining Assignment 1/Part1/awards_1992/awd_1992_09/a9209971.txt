Abstract    :
              The environmental impact and performance of building materials has not         
              been formally synthesized and presented to architects and designers for        
              their consideration in the design process.  This project is a                  
              planning activity to identify the materials and their                          
              energy/environmental concerns and to categorize them for                       
              evaluation and integration.
