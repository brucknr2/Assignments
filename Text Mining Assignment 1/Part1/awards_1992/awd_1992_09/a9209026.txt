Abstract    :
              The purpose of this proposal is to support the Institute of                    
              Ethnology and Anthropology, Russian Academy of Sciences, Moscow,               
              in connection with planning for The Seventh International                      
              Conference on Hunting and Gathering Societies (August 1993). There             
              is an extremely limited ethnographic and ethnohistoric data base               
              on indigenous peoples in the Russian North. This meeting will                  
              facilitate the first meaningful worldwide communication with                   
              scholars and native peoples within Russia, and lay the groundwork              
              for future international research support and collaboration in                 
              northern ethnography, anthropology, lingusitics and archaeology.
