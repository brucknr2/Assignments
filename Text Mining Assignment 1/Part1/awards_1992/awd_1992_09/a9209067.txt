Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The "Conference on The Biology, Chemistry and Modelling of Vision:             
              Visual Processing" will be held at Vermont Academy in Saxton's River,          
              Vermont from June 21-26, 1992 in association with the Federation of            
              American Societies for Experimental Biology (FASEB).  Thirty-four              
              invited speakers from different subareas of retinal research will              
              provide both depth and breadth to the conference.                              
                                                                                             
              This is the first FASEB meeting on the topic and the organizers have           
              invited major leaders in the field of retinal processing.  The                 
              conference is open to an additional 120 scientists without invitation,         
              on a first-come basis and afternoon poster sessions have been                  
              organized for voluntary presentations.  The conference offers an               
              excellent opportunity for scientists using the retina as an                    
              experimental and/or model system in neuroscience to interact and share         
              their expertise.  Approximately one-third of the funds provided by NSF         
              will be used for women and minority participants.
