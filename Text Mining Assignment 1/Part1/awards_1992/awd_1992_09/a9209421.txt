Abstract    :
              This Research Planning Grant will enable Dr. Helen Leung to                    
              initiate a research program using fourier transform microwave                  
              spectroscopy to investigate weakly bound complexes of                          
              unsaturated molecules. In the early phase of the work a a                      
              pulsed molecular beam fourier transform microwave spectrometer                 
              will be constructed.  The average and equilibrium structures of                
              complexes formed from two unsaturated subunits will be                         
              determined for the ground vibrational states. Subsequent work                  
              will investigate the molecular dynamics of these systems and                   
              and the nature of van der Waals forces. This will be done by                   
              sampling the potential energy surfaces. It is intended that the                
              work will shed light on the raction dynamics of pericyclic                     
              cycloaddition reactions between the subunits.

              Research Planning Grants are awarded to women who have not yet                 
              received federal funding for their research. Dr. Leung will be                 
              constructing the equipment necessary to study the weak                         
              interactions among certain kinds of molecules. These                           
              interactions are very important in biological systems and, in                  
              general,  in a detailed understanding of how chemical reactions                
              proceed.
