Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The ability to perform a task which involves a choice of right                 
              versus left depends upon connections between the two sides of the              
              brain.  These connections are carried by a bundle of nerve fibers              
              called the corpus callosum.  in this award Dr. Noonan will                     
              investigate the effects on right-left discrimination of surgical               
              disruption of the corpus callosum and selective damage to various              
              areas of the neocortex which are interconnected by the corpus                  
              callosum.  His previous work has shown that surgical disruption of             
              brain pathways which interconnect the two hemispheres can actually             
              improve right-left differentiation and this award will explore more            
              precisely the anatomical localization of that phenomenon.  Many                
              aspects of the research will be performed by undergraduate                     
              students, who will receive valuable experience in basic scientific             
              work.  This research will contribute to understanding the brain                
              processes which are responsible for mediating spatial information              
              that allows an individual to navigate successfully in the                      
              environment.
