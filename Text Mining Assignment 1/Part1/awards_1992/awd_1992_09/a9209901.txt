Abstract    :
              Polyketides are a large family of                                              
              natural products found in bacteria,                                            
              fungi, and plants.  Many of them                                               
              are used as antibiotics, anticancer                                            
              agents, immunosuppressants, and                                                
              veterinary products.  They are also                                            
              important as natural food and                                                  
              flavoring agents, or as fungal                                                 
              toxins.  Biosynthesis of the carbon                                            
              backbones of all polyketides occurs                                            
              via a highly programmed                                                        
              polymerization process, which                                                  
              incorporates critical variations on                                            
              a common theme of enzyme catalyzed                                             
              reactions.  In each case, the                                                  
              highly selective sequence of                                                   
              reactions is catalyzed by a complex                                            
              enzyme known as the polyketide                                                 
              synthase.  The aim of this project                                             
              is to investigate the relationships                                            
              that exist between the structure                                               
              and the function of polyketide                                                 
              synthases.
