Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The research suggests using Evanescent Wave Induced                            
              Fluorescence to measure the adsorption from aqueous solution                   
              of polymer molecules onto solid surfaces.  The effect of                       
              polymer results will be applied to the adsorption of polymer                   
              molecules onto colloid particles for the purpose of regulating                 
              their interaction.  The study will focus particularly on                       
              hydrophobically modified polymers adsorbing onto hydrophobic                   
              surfaces, and the results should be applicable to a wide                       
              variety of polymer colloid systems.
