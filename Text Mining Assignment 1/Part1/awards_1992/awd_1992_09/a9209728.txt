Abstract    :
              Computer vision systems typically begin by finding boundaries in               
              their input images, i.e. locations at which properties change                  
              sharply (often indicating the edges of objects).  Boundary                     
              finding algorithms require an estimate of how much values vary                 
              within each image region.  Currently-available algorithms assume               
              that this scale of variation is constant across the image and,                 
              typically, that it is known a priori.  This assumption holds only              
              for the simplest images and fails for many common sorts of                     
              inputs, including images containing significant texture,                       
              functions describing image texture (e.g. texture orientation at                
              each image location), and surface depths computed by stereo                    
              matching.  This research will develop an algorithm for estimating              
              scale within individual image regions and, using it, a boundary                
              finder that can operate on a much wider range of inputs.  The new              
              scale estimator relies on two keys ideas.  To eliminate                        
              contamination from a few "bad" values, the standard deviation                  
              (the traditional scale estimator), is replaced by an estimator                 
              from robust statistics (e.g. the -trimmed standard deviation).                 
              To avoid peaks in scale estimates near boundaries, the algorithm               
              derives its scale estimate from the minimum-scale neighborhood of              
              each image location.//
