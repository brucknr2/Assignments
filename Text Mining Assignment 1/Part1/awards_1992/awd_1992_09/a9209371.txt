Abstract    :
                   This research is to develop a scientific basis for analyzing              
              and optimizing fixture configurations in a manner that allows for              
              the automated design of fixtures during computer aided process                 
              planning.  The uniqueness of the approach is the inclusion of                  
              clamping force and the resulting deformation into the optimization             
              process.  This will be accomplished by abstracting the workpiece               
              geometry into a finite element model of the part and fixture to                
              analyze both the components as they are subjected to clamping                  
              forces.  The final stage will be the optimization of the                       
              configuration of the fixture on the basis of an optimization model             
              that is to be researched and developed as part of this project.                
                   Designing of fixtures to hold the workpiece during processing             
              is a critical aspect of process planning and a function that is                
              still carried out on an empirical basis.  A scientific approach                
              will enable the automation of this process while improving the                 
              efficiency of the manufacturing sector.
