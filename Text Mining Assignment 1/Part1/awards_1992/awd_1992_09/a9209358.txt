Abstract    :
              This Research Planning Grant will enable Dr. Stephanie Sen to                  
              initiate a research program in the design of antibodies which                  
              have the ability to assist in the hydrogenation of activated                   
              and inactivated olefins. The approach is to generate monoclonal                
              antibodies that work in conjunction with transition metal                      
              catalysts to asssist in the hydrogenation of olefins.                          
              Preliminary research will focus upon determining preparative                   
              methods. Subsequent work includes the study of enantioselective                
              reactions that these antibodies may induce in  olefin                          
              hydrogenation.                                                                 
              %%%                                                                            
              Research Planning Grants are awarded to women who have not yet                 
              recieved federal funding for their research. Dr. Sen will be                   
              studying the development of catalysts from biological sources.                 
              These catalysts would assist in commercially important                         
              reactions and could represent a new class of non-polluting                     
              catalysts.
