Abstract    :
              The objective of this research is to develop basic understanding               
              of the effect of vibrations on phase separation of immiscible                  
              contaminants in soils saturated with Non-Aqueous Phase Liquid                  
              (NAPL) and water. Exploratory studies conducted by the principal               
              investigator indicate that vibrations induced in a soil medium                 
              saturated with NAPL and water can successfully separate and                    
              dislodge the NAPL phase. The proposed study will include a series              
              of laboratory tests to evaluate the vibratory phase separation of              
              NAPL ganglia as a function of vibration frequencies. The                       
              attenuation of vibratory phase separation will be assessed                     
              Dynamic criteria will be developed for phase separation and                    
              mobilization of immiscible ganglia in Soil-NAPL-water systems.
