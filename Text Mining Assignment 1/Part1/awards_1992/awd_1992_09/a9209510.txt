Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Many speculate about physiological and reproductive consequences               
              of age and social status but few have done more than speculate.                
              With the powerful new technique of DNA fingerprinting, this                    
              relationship can now be systematically studied.  By combining                  
              hormonal measurements of estrogen, testosterone and prolactin with             
              DNA paternity determination and direct behavioral observations, Dr.            
              Bercovitch will gain new insights into unraveling the association              
              between social status, reproductive maturation and reproductive                
              success in male rhesus macaques.   Using these primates as a                   
              biological model for human physiology and behavior, he will use                
              this information to develop paradigms for understanding male life              
              history strategies.  Dr. Bercovitch will also explore factors                  
              promoting paternal care and determine the role that hormones and               
              actual paternity have on this important function.  This project                
              represents an integration of molecular genetic data with hormonal              
              life history theory and behavioral ecology and provides a                      
              innovative framework to understand the mechanisms underlying                   
              variation in male reproductive success.
