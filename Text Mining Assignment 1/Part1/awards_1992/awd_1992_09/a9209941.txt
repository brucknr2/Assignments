Abstract    :
              This research will gain detailed                                               
              understanding of the mechanism of the                                          
              photorefractive effect in polymer                                              
              photorefractive materials, particularly the                                    
              underlying physics of photoconduction,                                         
              charge trapping, electro-optic response,                                       
              and dielectric relaxation in the polymers.                                     
              This knowledge will permit the synthesis                                       
              and fabrication of improved photorefractive                                    
              polymers suitable for use in a wide range                                      
              of applications, particularly those which will                                 
              take advantage of the relatively low cost                                      
              and the ease and flexibility of processing of                                  
              polymers as compared to crystalline                                            
              materials.  The insight gained will also be                                    
              beneficial in modelling the performance of                                     
              polymer photorefractive devices.
