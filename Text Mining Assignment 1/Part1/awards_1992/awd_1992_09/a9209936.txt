Abstract    :
              The Federation of the American Sociey for Experimental Biology                 
              will host a conference on Plant Molecular Genetics at Copper                   
              Mountain, Colorado, on August 9-14, 1992.  Overall, the objective              
              of the conference is to bring together genetic approaches to                   
              studies of plant development, hormone action, transcriptional                  
              regulation, biochemical regulation, and disease resistance.

              It is timely and useful to bring together plant scientists at a                
              conference where the key emphasis is on the use of genetic analysis            
              in the study of plant biology.
