Abstract    :
              To produce the dramatic increases in computer system                           
              performance needed to solve the "grand challenge"                              
              computational problems, it will be necessary to incorporate                    
              more parallel processing technology into new computer designs.                 
                                                                                             
              A major impediment to achieving high performance in a                          
              multiprocessor, however, is the delay encountered when                         
              accessing the data memory.  Current techniques for reducing                    
              the memory delay, such as data prefetching, vector memory                      
              fetches, and private data caches, have not been as effective                   
              in multiprocessors as in traditional uniprocessors because                     
              they have failed to use all of the available information.  In                  
              particular, these techniques  typically rely only on the                       
              information available at run-time, which is insufficient in                    
              the complex environment of a multiprocessor system.  The                       
              primary objective of this research project is to develop and                   
              analyze new techniques for improving multiprocessor memory                     
              performance by integrating hardware and software strategies to                 
              utilize all of the memory referencing information.  The                        
              project will explore both semantic information at compile-time                 
              and dynamic information at run-time to improve data                            
              prefetching, processor scheduling, data placement, and cache                   
              coherence enforcement.  The new techniques generated through                   
              this research will be validated using a unique combination of                  
              trace-driven simulations, mathematical models, software                        
              prototypes running on actual parallel machines, and                            
              implementation of new algorithms in a parallelizing compiler.
