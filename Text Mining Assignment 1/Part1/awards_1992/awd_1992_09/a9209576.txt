Abstract    :
                 This proposal is funded under the Research Initiation Awards                
              (RIA) Program Announcement, NSF 88-99.  The research builds on a               
              cognitive model to provide a scientific basis for understanding                
              how people perceive and process information from graphic                       
              displays.  Phase 1 proposes to model ocular scanning behavior                  
              using knowledge about the graphic display and the goal structure               
              of the task.  The goal is to measure the similarity among                      
              sequences of eye movements used to answer questions posed to a                 
              range of graphic displays. Phase 2 of this research explores                   
              errors people make processing information from complex                         
              information displays.  The studies examine when working memory                 
              overload occurs, what information is lost, and how overload                    
              influences performance accuracy.  The resulting model will                     
              provide a research tool for understanding visual cognition and                 
              perception.  It will also provide designers a metric for                       
              measuring display quality, working memory constraints, and                     
              information processing time.
