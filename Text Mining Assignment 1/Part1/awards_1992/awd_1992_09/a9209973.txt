Abstract    :
              This RIA award will develop a cure monitor technique which can be              
              integrated into automated control schemes for economical                       
              manufacturing of composite structures.  It will be based on the                
              methodology of the ultrasonic cure monitor (UCM) technique for                 
              use in the processing of laminated graphite/epoxy composite                    
              materials as well as the necessary analytical tools to relate                  
              ultrasonic wave speed and attenuation to the cure state of the                 
              composite.  From this, a comprehensive process model will be                   
              developed for use in cure cycle optimization and control.
