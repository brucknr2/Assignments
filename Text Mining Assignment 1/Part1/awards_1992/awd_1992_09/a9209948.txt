Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Funded by a Research Initiation Award, experimental research will              
              be carried out on microbursts.  Microbursts are intense downdrafts             
              which can occur during intense thunderstorms.  Experimental                    
              information is lacking, and this research will create laboratory               
              simulations with heavy saline water in a water tank experiment with            
              otherwise freshwater.  Flow visualization and particle imaging                 
              velocimetry will provide data on the dynamics of microbursts and               
              their interaction with the ground.                                             
                                                                                             
              Microbursts have been responsible for the catastrophic crashes of              
              aircraft, and their structure and development is still largely                 
              unknown.
