Abstract    :
              The focus of this research is the development of new classes of                
              radical reactions based on the study of mechanism and rate.                    
              Acyl germanes, silanes and stannanes will be developed as                      
              reagents for radical additions, cyclizations and annulations.                  
              Aryl selenomalonitriles will be developed in the same vein with                
              a special emphasis on the study of 1,2-asymmetric radical                      
              reactions.

              With this award, the Synthetic Organic Program is supporting                   
              the research of Dr. Dennis P. Curran of the Department of                      
              Chemistry at the University of Pittsburgh.  Professor Curran                   
              will focus his work on the understanding of organic radical                    
              reactions and the development of new transformations which will                
              add to the repertoire of preparatively useful radical reactions.
