Abstract    :
              The object of the research is to develop a new approach for                    
              control design of flexible multibody systems. Distributed                      
              parameter actuator and sensor technologies which incorporate                   
              piezoelectric materials within structural components will be used              
              in conjunction with discrete controls applied at the component                 
              boundaries to effect high-precision operations of a multibody                  
              system. The distributed parameter control algorithms will be                   
              derived from multibody systems models based on geometrically                   
              exact structural theories. Such structural theories provide an                 
              accurate representation of the nonlinear dynamics of finite                    
              rotations and also model nonlinear effects of moderate large                   
              deformations, centrifugal stiffening, and material damping. The                
              intent of such an advanced formulation is to provide a unified                 
              theory to address the increasingly lightweight and flexible                    
              designs of next-generation space structures and robot                          
              manipulators.*** //
