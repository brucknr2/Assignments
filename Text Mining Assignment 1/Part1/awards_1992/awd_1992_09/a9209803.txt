Abstract    :
              This award provides support for the development of a research                  
              plan on algorithmic issues of combinatorial problems in the                    
              solution of large sparse symmetric positive definite systems                   
              of linear equations.  The primary goal is to develop a                         
              theoretical research program that addresses issues of interest                 
              to the sparse matrix community.  Fundamental to the planning                   
              activities will be open discussions and seminars between                       
              senior researchers in the algorithms community and                             
              practitioners in the sparse matrix community.  Through these                   
              discussions the investigator will determine problems of                        
              interest to the sparse matrix community and cast them in                       
              theoretical terms.  This collaboration will afford the                         
              investigator a rare opportunity to create a unique and useful                  
              research program.
