Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  This study will examine the impact of social change on                    
              shifts over the last century in the legislative agenda of the                  
              U.S. labor movement.  The study will address how factors such as               
              industrialization, capital concentration, status differentiation               
              in the working class, and the increased economic role of the                   
              state may have influenced the labor movements increasingly                     
              redistributive legislative agenda.  The study will use time                    
              series regression analysis to analyze data derived from the Labor              
              Federation Resolutions File, a comprehensive inventory of labor's              
              legislative agenda.                                                            
                   The study will contribute to our understanding of how                     
              social, political, and organizational changes in American society              
              have affected the relationship between organized labor and the                 
              national government.
