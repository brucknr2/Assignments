Abstract    :
              This research attempts to characterize the main factors                        
              influencing well or aquifer dewatering and aquifer contamination               
              potential in subsiding environments, examine their effect,                     
              quantify their magnitude in advance of mining and propose methods              
              to mitigate undesirable effects. Previous work has illustrated                 
              that strata dewatering above longwall mines is controlled by the               
              deformation and fracturing patterns induced by ground subsidence               
              above the panel. Hydraulic conductivity and storage changes may                
              be represented by simple physical models and used in numerical                 
              models to determine dewatering potential a priori. It is proposed              
              to extend this work to determine transient behavior and provide a              
              logical extension in defining changes to water quality.
