Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Monosodium-L-glutamate (MSG) and some 5'-ribonucleotides produce a             
              unique taste, which is distinct from the classical taste qualities             
              of sweet, sour, salty, and bitter.  Although several different                 
              mechanisms, including direct stimulus modulation of ion channels               
              and indirect effects mediated by G-protein-regulated second                    
              messengers, have been implicated in taste cell responses to                    
              different classes of stimuli, little is known about how MSG elicits            
              a taste response.  Recent studies in our laboratory suggest the MSG            
              taste transduction may involve specific receptor proteins which,               
              like ionotropic neurotransmitter receptors for glutamate, contain              
              integral ion channels that open when glutamate binds to the                    
              receptor.  Whole-cell patch-clamp recording and the Ca2+-sensitive             
              dye, fura-2, will be used to characterize MSG-regulated currents               
              and changes in intracellular calcium in taste receptor cells                   
              isolated from C3H mice, a strain capable of discriminating MSG from            
              other taste qualities.  The results of these experiments will                  
              generate fundamental information about glutamate signal                        
              transduction in taste cells and will contribute to our general                 
              understanding of receptor mediated processes.
