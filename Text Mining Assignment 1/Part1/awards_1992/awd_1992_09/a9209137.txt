Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  This is a study of the relevance of plague and war to the                 
              witch hunts which took place in Germany, England and Scotland                  
              during the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries.  Previous                      
              historical research has shown that witch-hunting was a patterned               
              activity that spread throughout Europe and, ultimately, to the                 
              American colonies.  This study will concentrate on two specific                
              threats or crises that have been suggested as causes of the                    
              European witch craze--plague and war.  The study will examine                  
              whether witch hunts fluctuated in a manner that correlates with                
              similar fluctuations in war and plague.  Data on witch-hunts,                  
              plague, war and population characteristics will be coded from                  
              historical works and demographies for GErmany, Scotland and                    
              England.  These data will be analyzed using time series and                    
              spatial analysis techniques.                                                   
                   The study will be the first study addressing the hypotheses               
              relating witch-hunting to plague and war through a systematic,                 
              quantitative examination of historical and demographic data.  The              
              study will improve our understanding of the social and economic                
              causes of witch-hunting in particular, and of the persecution of               
              deviant groups in general.
