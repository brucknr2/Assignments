Abstract    :
              Copper oxide superconductors with transition temperature (Tc) as               
              high as 125K have been much studied during the past few years but              
              the origin of the high Tc and that of the unusual normal state are             
              still unknown.  We propose to prepare copper oxide scs with lower              
              Tc and to measure their physical properties.  Measurements will be             
              made on high-quality crystals with a systematic variation of                   
              doping (carriers).  The objective is to elucidate the mechanism for            
              superconductivity and the nature of the anomalous normal state in              
              all copper oxide superconductors.
