Abstract    :
                   This project will explore theoretical and practical aspects of            
              newly-developed waveform conjugate-direction methods for parallel              
              solution of initial value problems (IVPs).                                     
                   Waveform relaxation (WR), a waveform-based iterative technique,           
              is an increasingly popular parallel solution approach for IVPs.                
              Conjugate-direction waveform methods have dramatically improved the            
              convergence properties of WR for transient simulation of MOS devices.          
              The project will establish the basis for broader application of these          
              methods by developing refined convergence estimates and by building            
              and testing a parallel implementation.                                         
                   New convergence results will be sought for conjugate-direction            
              waveform methods applied to linear and nonlinear systems of ODEs and           
              DAEs.  The effects of discretization and multirate integration will            
              also be studied.                                                               
                   Pointwise and waveform-based IVP solvers will be implemented on           
              ASIM, the Alewife simulator, and on the Alewife parallel computer.             
              Their behavior for a variety of ODE and DAE problems on various                
              hardware configuration will be compared.                                       
                   Waveform conjugate-direction methods appear to be an efficient            
              and practical class of parallel techniques for a variety of                    
              applications.  Together, the theoretical results and practical                 
              implementations will demonstrate their value and applicability.
