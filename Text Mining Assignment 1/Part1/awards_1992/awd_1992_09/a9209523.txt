Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Potassium channels are one of the main groups of intrinsic membrane            
              proteins which are fundamental for the generation and coding of                
              signals in the nervous system to convert environmental information             
              into a language understood by the brain.  The brain carries out a              
              variety of distinct functions and, as such, requires a large number            
              of coding mechanisms.  To provide for this the nervous system has              
              developed a variety of potassium channels, each type with specific             
              structural and biophysical properties related to its function.  To             
              analyze this diversity, genes that give rise to the large                      
              structural diversity of these channels are being identified and                
              isolated to be reinserted into simple model systems, i.e., oocytes             
              (egg) of the frog, where they can be isolated and studied in the               
              absence of the complex functions of the intact nervous system which            
              normally complicates their study.  This project explores the                   
              structure and function of one type potassium channel that has been             
              identified in higher animals and humans but whose function is not              
              known.
