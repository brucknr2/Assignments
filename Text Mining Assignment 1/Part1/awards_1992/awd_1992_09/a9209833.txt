Abstract    :
              The purpose of this research is twofold:  to investigate the                   
              power of counting solutions to computational problems, and to                  
              determine the properties shared by the typical languages in a                  
              complexity class.  Counting has been shown to be much harder                   
              than once thought, and deep connections have been drawn                        
              between the algebraic properties of counting classes and their                 
              computational difficulty.  The goal is to resolve the                          
              structural relationships between counting classes and to show                  
              that, although each solution to a problem is easily                            
              verifiable, counting number of solutions is inherently                         
              difficult.                                                                     
                                                                                             
              Adapting the analytic notions of measure and category to                       
              complexity theory has yielded new techniques to study the                      
              internal structure of a complexity class.  Various properties                  
              can be classified as either 'typical' or 'exceptional' for                     
              languages in the class, giving an overall qualitative picture                  
              of the class, and providing insight into the relative                          
              difficulties of computational problems.  These new techniques,                 
              and their relation to pseudorandom sequences, will be                          
              investigated.*** //
