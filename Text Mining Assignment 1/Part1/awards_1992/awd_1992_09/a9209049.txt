Abstract    :
                   The objective of this research is to understand the dynamic               
              response of continuous media via the study of singularities for                
              the governing partial differential equations of motion.  Three                 
              topics are proposed: (i) Formation of shear bands at high strain               
              rates; (ii) Study of self-similar viscous limits and of radial                 
              solutions for hyperbolic systems of conservation laws; (iii)                   
              Hydrodynamic limits for discrete velocity models in the case of                
              Riemann data.                                                                  
                   Shear bands are regions of intensely localized strain that                
              appear during high speed deformations of metals and often precede              
              rupture.  For that reason their study is critical for the design               
              of improved materials in situations of high speed plastic flow.                
              The theoretical understanding of structures such as shock waves                
              or shear bands is critical for designing improved algorithms in                
              technological applications where such phenomena are dominant, for              
              instance in ballistic penetration of metals and in various                     
              manufacturing processes involving metals.
