Abstract    :
              The purpose of this research is to analyze the effects of the tax              
              system on the international location of business activity and the              
              employment of productive factors such as labor, capital, and R & D.            
              Tax effects are analyzed in two contexts.  The first is the                    
              location, foreign and domestic, of the R & D activities of U.S.                
              multinational firms.  Owing to particular aspects of U.S. tax                  
              changes in the 1980's, the tax law introduced firm-specific                    
              incentives for some U.S. firms to reduce their domestic R & D                  
              expenditures and locate some of their R & D activity abroad.  The              
              research uses the National Science Survey of R & D activities to               
              investigate the extent to which firms responded to these                       
              incentives.  The second context is the location decision of foreign            
              firms doing business in the U.S.  Foreign investors from certain               
              foreign countries are likely to be insensitive, or at least less               
              sensitive than other investors to U.S. tax obligations.  Tax rates             
              vary considerably between states in the U.S.  The study will                   
              determine the extent to which foreign investors respond to                     
              differences in state corporate income tax rates, in order to                   
              identify the features of foreign income tax systems that make                  
              foreign investors responsive to local tax conditions.
