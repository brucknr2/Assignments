Abstract    :
              This planning grant, submitted in conjunction with the Minority                
              Research Initiation program of the NSF, is to develop a strategy               
              to form an experimental approach to the health monitoring issue of             
              structures.  This approach will have its origins in control system             
              realization theory.  An analysis is to be developed that would                 
              allow the field engineer to compare current realizations of an                 
              aging, or possibly damaged complex structure, to realizations of               
              the structure when the system was "new" and assumed healthy.
