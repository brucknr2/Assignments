Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                                                                                             
                                         ABSTRACT                                            
                                                                                             
                                                                                            
              How do teachers, coaches, counselors, and parents reach                        
              conclusions about the abilities of those whose skills and                      
              performances they are attempting to influence?  If a student does              
              well only when assisted or clued by the teacher, will the teacher              
              rate the student's intelligence higher or lower than the                       
              intelligence of a student who is relatively unresponsive to help,              
              but does quite well without it?  These questions have been                     
              addressed in an unsystematic and inconclusive way in previous                  
              studies.  This research is designed to pose these and similar                  
              questions, looking at such factors as (1) the degree of                        
              convariation between clues chosen by the teacher, and successes                
              registered by the student and (2) the particular goal or                       
              orientation of the teachers.  Preliminary studies show that                    
              intellectual ability is evaluated very differently when the                    
              purpose of instruction is raised.  Such appraisals (in the form                
              of teacher expectancies) can be extremely important in guiding                 
              teacher behavior and, often, creating self-fulfilling prophecies.
