Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This project studies the role of information in individual decision            
              making and in the structure of markets by which resources are                  
              reallocated socially.  The underlying theme is that recognizing                
              that knowledge is neither free nor infinitely costly has many                  
              implications for the means by which individuals reallocate their               
              resources, including their stock of information, and for                       
              transactions among individuals by which both goods and knowledge               
              are transferred.                                                               
                                                                                             
              The role of information in individual decisions is to be studied               
              as a basis for the still more fundamental issue of providing a                 
              general model for economic activity.  The market as understood in              
              standard economic theory merely approximates economic processes,               
              and is valid only in limiting cases where certain information costs            
              vanish.  The outcome of this research will be above all conceptual             
              rather than technical, although numerous analytic questions must               
              be raised in the process.  Also, it provides better understanding              
              of the foundations of the theory of economic institutions including            
              firms, markets, and market equilibrium.
