Abstract    :
              The goal of this RIA award is to understand the reasons for the                
              reduction in the densification rate of ceramic matrices when low               
              volume fractions of inclusions are incorporated in the particle                
              compact.  Experiments will be performed to: (1) identify critical              
              parameters that can be used to predict the densification of the                
              composites, and (2) explore the ways in which processing                       
              variables affect the critical parameters.  This understanding                  
              will lead to processing strategies that produce dense, defect-                 
              free ceramic composites.
