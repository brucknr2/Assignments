Abstract    :
                   Dr. Boehmer will generate the first electron-positron plasma              
              ever produced in the laboratory.  Plasma parameters are expected               
              to be qualitatively different from conventional electron-ion                   
              plasmas, in particular electromagnetic wave propagation should                 
              carry a polarization signature distinctly different from ordinary              
              plasmas.
