Abstract    :
                   The principal investigator is developing an integrated framework          
              for the specification and analysis of real-time systems.  Since the            
              timing behavior of a system critically depends on the availability of          
              shared resources,the approach unites the areas of process                      
              specification, concurrency theory and real-time scheduling.  The               
              result is a layered framework called Communication Shared Resources.           
              At the top layer is the CSR Application Language, which describes the          
              functional and temporal requirements of a system.  At the next layer           
              is the CSR Configuration Language, which maps process to resources,            
              and specifies the system's interconnection network.  At the lowest             
              level is the CCSR process algebra, which embraces a resource-based             
              view of concurrency,and is defined by a prioritized operational                
              semantics.                                                                     
                   The researcher is constructing an integrated toolset based on             
              this theory.  A reachability analyzer checks for violations of real-           
              time constraints explicitly denoted within a finite-state                      
              applications.  A model-checker is used to verify real-time safety              
              assertions that are not denoted within an application.  Finally, a             
              simulator tests the system, using test suites generated from the               
              characteristics of the implementation environment.
