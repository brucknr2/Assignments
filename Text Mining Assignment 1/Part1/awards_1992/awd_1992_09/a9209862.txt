Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This is a three year cooperative study proposed by Dr. Sangtae                 
              Kim, the University of Wisconsin, Madison and Professor Huan J.                
              Keh, National Taiwan University supported by the AIT (U.S.) -                  
              CCNAA (Taiwan) Cooperative Science Program.  This project plans                
              to study the microstructures of electrophoresis.  Electrophoresis              
              is one of the most important techniques used in the chemical and               
              biological sciences.  Dr. Kim is a leading U.S. researcher in the              
              area of computer simulations and two-phrase flows.  Professor                  
              Huan J. Ken of the National Taiwan University is a specialist in               
              electrophoresis.  Their expertise compliment well and the                      
              collaboration is mutually beneficial.  This study has been the                 
              potential to significantly advance our understanding of the                    
              microstructures of electrophoresis.
