              Funds are requested to provide partial international travel support            
              for US participants to present papers at The 21st International                
              Conference on the Physics of Semiconductors (ICPS-21).  The funds              
              would be used exclusively for the support for graduate students,               
              and young researchers and faculty.  (20 graduate students/young                
              researchers (contributed papers) and 4 key speakers (invited                   
              papers)).  The selection would be based upon need and achievement.
