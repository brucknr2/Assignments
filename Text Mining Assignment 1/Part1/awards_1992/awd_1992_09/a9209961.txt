Abstract    :
              The purpose of this research is to develop a semi-analytical                   
              sensitivity analysis procedure for predicting the effects of                   
              geometric and/or material nonlinearities and perturbations on the              
              nonlinear large deformation response of composites.  Of                        
              particular interest is the post-failure behavior.  For the class               
              of problems being considered, methods such as the global finite                
              difference technique or the traditional incremental methods lead               
              to erroneous results because of the non-smoothness of the                      
              constitutive equations of the composite.  Instead, a direct                    
              differentiation approach and a variational approach that uses the              
              adjoint state concept will be studied in order to include the                  
              effects of non-smoothness in the stress-strain relationships.                  
              Results obtained from the sensitivity analysis procedure will be               
              compared with test data as a step in the verification of the                   
              proposed methodology.
