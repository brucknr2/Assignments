Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This is an application for a Career Advancement Award to support               
              the applicant while she learns modern molecular biological                     
              techniques in the laboratory of another investigator.  The                     
              objective is to enable the applicant, who has considerable                     
              experience with neuroanatomical and experimental embryological                 
              approaches to developmental neurobiology, to expand the range of               
              techniques available to her for continued research on fundamental              
              problems in nervous system development.  The proposed project will             
              teach her a variety of molecular biological methods including in               
              situ hybridization and some associated recombinant DNA techniques,             
              including PCR, subcloning, gel electrophoresis, plasmid                        
              preparation, restriction mapping, sequencing,  and transcription of            
              labelled RNAs.  In the future, the applicant expects to use these              
              methods in her own laboratory in combination with other traditional            
              approaches for continued studies of patter formation in the central            
              nervous system.
