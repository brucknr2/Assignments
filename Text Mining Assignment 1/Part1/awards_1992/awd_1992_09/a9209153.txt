Abstract    :
                   This project will focus on the development of a design                    
              environment to rapidly design and produce toys.  This environment              
              aims to help the domestic toy industry gain competitiveness by                 
              speedily designing and producing new toys to meet changing market              
              demands.  The project will first outline an information system                 
              for model kits and their plastic injection molds with regard to                
              the design, fabrication, storage, and setup of molds to improve                
              the efficiency of the model kits' design and production.  A                    
              method for quick mold, for improving the model design, and for                 
              making new molds by redesigning existing ones through structural               
              information query will be investigated.                                        
                   The system is expected to capture the design knowledge of                 
              existing model kits and their molds, to reduce the cost and                    
              planning time required for a new design, and to reduce overall                 
              setup time for mold production.
