Abstract    :
              This Research Initiation Award funds a study of the modeling,                  
              simulation and control aspects on inherently nonlinear                         
              electromechanical systems which exhibit chaos. The research has                
              both experimental and analytical components and emphasizes control             
              strategies. Both active and passive control strategies will be                 
              developed to delineate regions of safe operation. Periodic                     
              excitations will be used as inputs to lock the system into an                  
              unstable periodic orbit representing chaotic response. Control                 
              schemes will then be used to stabilize the motion. The results                 
              should be applicable to dynamic systems such as printers and gear              
              mechanisms with backlash.*** //
