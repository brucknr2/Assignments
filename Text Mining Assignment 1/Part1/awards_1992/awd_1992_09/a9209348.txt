Abstract    :
                   The two most important problems that allow for the                        
              efficient use of parallel processing power can be identified as                
              detection of parallelism in computer programs and scheduling of                
              the resulting parallel tasks on a target machine.  This work is                
              concerned with both of these problems.                                         
                   It is only recently that some researchers are concentrating               
              on the detection of parallelism in ordinary (non-scientific)                   
              application programs.  The research to be developed subsequent                 
              to the completion of the planning period will concentrate on                   
              detection of parallelism and determination of optimal task                     
              granularity in ordinary computer programs and processor                        
              scheduling and synchronization in multiprocessor environments.                 
              The research planning period mainly consists of plans for                      
              spending certain periods of time in residence in leading                       
              research sites around the country in order to get involved in                  
              the ongoing research in these sites and broaden the proposer's                 
              basis for doing independent research.
