Abstract    :
                   Professor Westling will study the intensity and phase                     
              fluctuations of diode laser sources.  The goal of her research is              
              to understand the role of these fluctuations when exciting atomic              
              ensembles.  Professor Westling will measure the correlation                    
              function of spontaneous emission in the atomic ensemble when                   
              excited by fluctuating laser diode light.
