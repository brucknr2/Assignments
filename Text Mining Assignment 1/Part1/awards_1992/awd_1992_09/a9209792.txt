Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  This collaborative research (with Wright, SES92-09210) will               
              study work, social class, and social mobility in Russia and the                
              United States.  Exact replicate surveys were designed and                      
              administered in European Russia and the USA in 1991.  The study                
              will analyze these survey data to describe and compare the class               
              structure in the two countries.  The study will examine                        
              differences between the US and Russia in attitudes toward                      
              egalitarianism, the normative link between education, occupation               
              and income, and attitudes toward state versus private control of               
              the economy.                                                                   
                   The study will provide a much need comparative perspective                
              on social stratification in Russia and the United States and shed              
              new light on the relationship between social structure and                     
              stratification processes.  The study also will make an important               
              contribution to the study of the relationship between type of                  
              political economy and social mobility and equality of                          
              opportunity.
