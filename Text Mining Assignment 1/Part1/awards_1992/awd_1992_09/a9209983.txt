Abstract    :
              This research is concerned with developing                                     
              methodologies for solving practical issues of                                  
              reconfigurable control systems.  The original                                  
              motivation comes from the need for analytical                                  
              redundant management of control elements                                       
              (e.g.actuators) in the event of hardware failures in                           
              high reliability systems.  One such example is                                 
              modern combat aircraft subjected to                                            
              actuator/surface impairments.  A major task is to                              
              achieve reconfigurable control designs balancing                               
              impairment detectability and sufficient robustness.                            
              This involves careful selection of types and                                   
              parameters of the controllers and the impairment                               
              detecting filters used.  Algorithms are proposed to                            
              make such selection systematic.  A further                                     
              investigation is focused on enhancing the speed and                            
              accuracy of the failure detection and isolation FDI                            
              unit.  It is suggested that a more deterministic                               
              approach be taken to better utilize all available                              
              information.  A rule based strategy for FDI is                                 
              described.  Developments made through the                                      
              proposed research are expected to result in                                    
              significant improvement in terms of the overall                                
              system's reliability and maintainability.
