Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This research focuses on attempts by Mayan peoples in Guatemala                
              to create a civil, multicultural, and all encompassing state in                
              the context of 35 year civil war.  Recently there has been an                  
              increase in the number of Mayan groups who are attempting to                   
              define themselves in the context of a multicultural state and, at              
              the same, time maintain some sense of ethnic identity.  The key                
              issue the PI hopes to illuminate is the fact that states consist               
              of a variety of interest groups which compete and cooperate as                 
              they struggle to articulate some form of a national identity.                  
              This process will be examined by interviewing leaders in                       
              government, business, military, and ethnic sectors and analyzing               
              their statements presented i the media, at festivals, tourism                  
              literature, and political rallies.
