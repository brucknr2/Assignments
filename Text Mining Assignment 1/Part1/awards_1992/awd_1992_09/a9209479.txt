Abstract    :
              This proposal is to study regulation of gene expression by                     
              interaction with transcription factor proteins which bind certain              
              specific sequence elements in the DNA. Two classes of transcription            
              factors have been described: AP1 and CREB. In order to bind DNA,               
              the proteins must first dimerize. One of the AP1 proteins, cJUN,               
              can form homodimers and respond to the TRE sequence element, or can            
              form heterodimers with any of three CREB proteins and bind to the              
              CRE sequence element. Each of these complexes has a unique trans-              
              activation potential. All potential dimer complexes will be trans-             
              lated from cDNA clones in reticulocyte lysates, and binding to                 
              oligonucleotides of known sequence will be determined by gel                   
              retardation analysis. Constructs of a plasmid containing the                   
              reporter gene luciferase coupled to the various oligonucleotides               
              will be used to determine transactivation potential at various                 
              points in the cell cycle.                                                      
              %%%                                                                            
              This proposal is to study proteins which enhance and promote the               
              transcription of DNA, the genetic material. Two kinds of proteins              
              (a total of four) will be used. The proteins contain two                       
              interesting structural features: DNA binding regions and "leucine              
              zippers", which allow the proteins to form pairs of identical or               
              different proteins. Each dimer binds to a unique sequence in DNA;              
              the sequences will be determined and compared. The importance of               
              the stage of the cell cycle for one type of dimer or another will              
              be determined using luciferase from firefly tails as a reporter                
              molecule.
