Abstract    :
              The rapid prototyping of systems with unconstrained design spaces              
              is limited by the present need to effectively re-develop all                   
              aspects of a new system.  The work here is the first step towards              
              reusability of subsystems and the capability to achieve such                   
              reusability from a variety of CAD platforms and for a variety of               
              implementation technologies.  There are several challenges to be               
              met in achieving the stated goal of subsystem reusability.  The                
              foremost challenge is the need to maintain consistent and                      
              documented representations of the various modules at various levels            
              of design such as printed circuit boards, netlists, functional                 
              models, behavioral models, or design specifications.  Moreover, any            
              useful solution must be applicable to various CAD tools and                    
              environments and not limited to one choice.  The research here                 
              consists of three phases:  the study of representation models and              
              how consistency can be maintained across various representations,              
              the development of subsystems according to the representation                  
              models developed in the first phase, and the rapid development of              
              a variety of systems with the new approach.  Existing CAD tools for            
              system design are used extensively, and new tools are developed                
              largely to drive existing tools rather than replace them.
