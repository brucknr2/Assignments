Abstract    :
                   During the last few decades linear algebra has played a                   
              fundamental role in advances being made in the area of signals,                
              systems and control.  The most profound impact has been in the                 
              computational and implementational aspects, where numerical linear             
              algebraic algorithms have strongly influenced the ways in which                
              problems are being solved.  The advent of special computing                    
              architectures such as vector processors and distributed processor              
              arrays has also emphasized parallel and real-time processing of basic          
              linear algebra modules for these application areas.                            
                   This project is about numerical linear algebra and applications           
              in signals, systems and control, with special emphasis on                      
              implementation aspects on parallel architectures.  The focus is on             
              "special matrix" problems, i.e. matrices which are either sparse,              
              patterned or structured.  For such matrices appropriate definitions of         
              numerical stability and sensitivity have recently been introduced.             
              Numerical methods for the above application areas ought to be                  
              numerically stable in this restricted sense and at the same time ought         
              to exploit the structure of the matrices to improve computational              
              complexity and parallelizability.  This will be applied to challenging         
              problems in these areas such as target tracking, robust control and            
              model reduction of large scale plants.
