Abstract    :
                   A hierarchical model that integrates database and control is              
              developed for the dynamic operation of manufacturing cell                      
              systems.  Within the manufacturing control hierarchy, the cell                 
              control micromodel can function autonomously for the logic                     
              control of machines and robot move sequence in the cell.  With a               
              relational database structure containing required process data,                
              shop production orders are decomposed through run-time database                
              queries in constructing the corresponding cell control commands.               
                   This research incorporates a novel approach of integrating                
              data, control, and the cell operating characteristics metamodels               
              and endows the system  with a closed-loop ability in dealing with              
              multiple dynamic events inherent in manufacturing cell system                  
              operations.
