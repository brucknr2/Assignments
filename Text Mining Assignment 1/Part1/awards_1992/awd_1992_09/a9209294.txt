Abstract    :
              This research seeks to apply interior point                                    
              optimization methods to network modeling and                                   
              state estimation problems involving unmeasured                                 
              external network states.  In addition, it will improve                         
              the efficiency of interior point methods for power                             
              systems problems.  The basic approach will                                     
              minimize the injected power mismatch at buses on                               
              the boundary of the local network.  Alternate                                  
              strategies for choosing the barrier parameter of the                           
              interior point algorithm will be investigated to                               
              improve efficiency.  The outcome of this work will                             
              be a set of robust, rational approaches to large                               
              scale network modeling as well as an expanded set                              
              of powerful state estimation tools ready for                                   
              practical implementation.
