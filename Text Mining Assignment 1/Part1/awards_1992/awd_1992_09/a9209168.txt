Abstract    :
              The purpose of this research is to analyze the optimal government              
              behavior using models that account for the imperfect control                   
              national or local governments exercise over the movements of                   
              individuals across their borders.  Three different models are                  
              developed each of which addresses a particular aspect of labor                 
              mobility.  The first analyzes the problems created by the                      
              inability of governments to keep migrants outside of their                     
              borders.  The analysis will identify cases in which attempts to                
              restrict entry are inefficient from the viewpoint of the entire                
              system of regions.  Inefficiencies of this type are becoming                   
              increasingly important not only within countries, but also in                  
              international contexts, such as in Western Europe as it enters                 
              into the 1992 Single Market initiative.                                        
                                                                                             
              The second model examines the optimal use of nonlinear income                  
              taxation to redistribute income within a region containing                     
              interregionally mobile individuals.  This research will bring                  
              together the literature on optimal income taxation and the                     
              provision of public goods.  The third model considers the                      
              situation where labor mobility among regions is costly and                     
              analyzes the ability of independent governments to redistribute                
              income and maintain efficient allocation of labor across regions.              
              This project is important because it will provide a deeper                     
              understanding and new insights concerning the impact governmental              
              policy on labor mobility.
