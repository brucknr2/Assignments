Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  Travel support is requested for US (non-government) and                   
              foreign scientists to attend the 13th International Conference on              
              Nucleation and Atmospheric Aerosols to be held in Salt Lake City,              
              Utah, 24-28 August 1992.  The four major topics of the Conference              
              are:  (1) fundamental processes of nucleation, (2) cloud droplet               
              nucleation in the atmosphere, (3) ice nucleation in the atmosphere,            
              and (4) formation, characteristics and climatological effects of               
              atmospheric aerosols.
