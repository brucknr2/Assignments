Abstract    :
                   This proposal is to study the spontaneous deletion mutant                 
              which occurs in the plague bacterium, Yersinia pestis, and results             
              in loss of the ability of the bacterium to accumulate hemin or                 
              Congo red and form dark, pigmented colonies.  The deletion involves            
              at least 40 kilobase pairs of chromosomal DNA.  The size of the in             
              the mutant will be determined.  Several mutants are available; this            
              will be constructed with deleted DNA end fragments from the mutant             
              bacteria, and used to transform wild-type cells to examine the                 
              involvement of the end fragments in generating the deletion.  The              
              mechanism of deletion will studied using the reporter gene                     
              construct.                                                                     
              %%%                                                                            
              The plague bacterium and several other pathogenic bacteria undergo             
              spontaneous deletion of large portions of chromosomal DNA.  The                
              plague bacterial mutants are detected by loss of the ability to                
              form dark-pigmented colonies.  Several mutants are available; DNA              
              sequences will be determined to see whether the site of excision is            
              same in all the mutants.  The DNA fragments representing the site              
              of cleavage will be added to a reporter gene to be added to wild-              
              type cells, to see whether the mechanism can be more clearly                   
              understood.
