Abstract    :
              Malik         This research is on verifying the temporal correctness of 
              synchronous digital systems.  The emphasis is on obtaining  accurate, efficient
              algorithms within the paradigm of certified  timing analysis.  This combines
              the efficiency and coverage of  timing analysis with the accuracy of timing
              simulation.  Vectors  that sensitize the long paths in the combinational parts
              of the  circuit are generated by timing analysis.  These are then used in 
              timing simulation.  The research addresses the problem that in  order to
              provide these vectors, timing analysis must consider the  functionality of the
              circuit components.
