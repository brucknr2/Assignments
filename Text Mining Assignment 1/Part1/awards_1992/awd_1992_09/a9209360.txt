Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This Doctoral Dissertation Support award is undergirded by William             
              Julius Wilson's concentration of poverty thesis.  The primary                  
              purpose of the analysis is to examine the political consequences               
              of living in extreme poverty communities.  The model for the                   
              investigation incorporates explanatory factors from both the urban             
              underclass and political participation literatures.  The exogenous             
              variables are neighborhood context and family context, while the               
              endogenous variables are socio-economic status, political                      
              orientation and political behavior.                                            
                                                                                             
              The data used to test the model will come from a survey of 400                 
              Black residents in extreme povery and low poverty neighborhoods in             
              Columbus, Ohio.  The data will be collected through telephone                  
              interviewing by Polimetrics Laboratory at the Ohio State                       
              University.                                                                    
                                                                                             
              The significance of the research rests on its attempts to assess               
              the extent to which underclass or extreme poverty neighborhoods and            
              impaired family contexts, have debilitating influences on the                  
              political orientations and behavior of residents.  Studies of the              
              political consequences of living in concentrated poverty                       
              communities are crucial to the understanding of the effects of                 
              poverty on political democracy.
