Abstract    :
                   This research is a  study of non-orthogonal multiaccess                   
              signalling schemes,  a generalization of the conventional                      
              orthogonal approach, in bandlimited and/or fading channels. These              
              signalling schemes are studied from the information theoretical                
              viewpoint and  the work seeks the capacity regions , the ultimate              
              performance limit, of channels using these signalling strategies.              
              Moreover, the study will address the issue of designing signature              
              waveforms to achieve these performance limits, and attempts to                 
              establish relationships  between signature waveform design                     
              and multiuser coding theory.  Following fruitful analysis in the               
              code-division multiaccess (CDMA) channel, a special  case of                   
              non-orthogonal signalling schemes, the project suggests the                    
              extension of the work to include  the general model. It is hoped               
              to develop a unified theory in multiaccess signalling that                     
              includes  conventional signalling strategies as well as the                    
              recently developed CDMA scheme. This  approach will broaden                    
              understanding in multiuser communications and lead to innovative               
              designs in multiuser signalling.  Practically, the outcomes of                 
              this project are likely to play an important role in mobile                    
              communications where bandwidth efficient multiaccess signalling                
              strategies are crucial for development.
