Abstract    :
              The principal investigator's                                                   
              previous theoretical work                                                      
              concentrated on the nonlinear                                                  
              optical and electro-optical                                                    
              properties of the asymmetric quantum                                           
              wells and superlattices.  He has                                               
              shown that in such structures large                                            
              optical nonlinearities can occur.                                              
              He has also shown that these                                                   
              nonlinearities can be enhanced by                                              
              Coulomb effects.  Some of the                                                  
              theoretical results were confirmed                                             
              experimentally by other scientists.                                            
                                                                                             
              He proposes to continue the                                                    
              theoretical research of novel                                                  
              quantum size heterostructures.  The                                            
              proposal involves the study of three                                           
              new phenomena:  a) carrier transport                                           
              in the p-i-p-n and n-i-n-p                                                     
              modulation-doped superlattices;                                                
              b)electroabsorption based on the                                               
              Quantum Confined Stark effect in                                               
              type II wide-bandgap superlattices;                                            
              and, c) intersubband transitions in                                            
              the asymmetric quantum wells in the                                            
              magnetic field.                                                                
                                                                                             
              This research will ascertain the                                               
              potential for the new                                                          
              heterostructure-based transistors,                                             
              photodetectors, and electro-optic                                              
              modulators and switches.
