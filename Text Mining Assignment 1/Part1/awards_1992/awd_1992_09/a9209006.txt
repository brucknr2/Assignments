Abstract    :
              Analytical and computational studies of the effect of the By-field             
              on the phenomena of cuurent disruption during substorms are                    
              proposed.  Such a study is warranted by observations of the                    
              presence of By in the quiescent as well as the active magnetotail.             
              Recently, we have shown that in the presence of By, the electron               
              tearing mode can be destabilized ?X. Wang, A. Bhattacharjee and

              Appendix.!.  We propose to extend our present work by means of                 
              analytical theory as well as particle simulation in the three-                 
              dimensional tail, and compare the predictions of theory with the               
              AMPTE/CCE database.  The specific tasks proposed are: (i) Unified              
              analytical theory of electron and ion tearing in the presence of               
              By, (ii) Particle simulation in a three-dimensional plasma sheet,              
              (iii) Analytical nonlinear mode-coupling theory and predictions of             
              particle acceleration, and (iv) comparison of theory with                      
              observations from AMPTE/CCE.
