Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The primary objective of this research is to develop mathematical              
              models that describe growth patterns and to develop alternate                  
              methods for the comparison of growth patterns between different                
              species of animals.  It has long been thought that the process of              
              growth plays an important role in producing the changes in                     
              appearance of animals through evolution.  One major theory is that             
              changes in either the timing or rate of growth can produce profound            
              changes in the appearance of an animal.  The investigators propose             
              to mathematically model changes in the timing of growth.  This will            
              be done using three-dimensional data from modern animals, providing            
              a realistic representation of how structure changes through time.              
              Using the mathematical models that they develop and                            
              three-dimensional data on the structure of living forms, the                   
              researchers will predict what that form would look like if it's                
              growth pattern was changed in a prescribed way.  These methods can             
              be used to test ideas about how the structure of modern animals                
              emerged from more primitive forms.
