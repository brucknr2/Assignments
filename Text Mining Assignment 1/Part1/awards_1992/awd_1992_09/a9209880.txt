Abstract    :
              This research investigates coordination of multiple mobile                     
              manipulators for grasping and transporting large and irregularly               
              shaped objects.  A mobile manipulator considered in this study is              
              composed of a mobile platform for locomotion and a manipulator                 
              for grasping and manipulation.  A large object without special                 
              features such as handles cannot easily be grasped by the                       
              conventional end effectors such as jaw grippers or multifingered               
              hands.  A new approach based on the concept of enveloping grasp                
              and manipulation by multiple mobile manipulators is proposed.                  
              The major contribution of the proposed study will be control                   
              algorithms for coordination of locomotion and manipulation of a                
              mobile manipulator with the motion of the manipulator being                    
              constrained, and coordination of two mobile manipulators for                   
              transporting large objects.  An experimental system will be                    
              developed to test and evaluate the proposed coordination                       
              algorithms. //
