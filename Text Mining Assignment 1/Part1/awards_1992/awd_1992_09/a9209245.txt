Abstract    :
              The purpose of this research is to analyze the participation of                
              women in the labor market, with special attention paid to the                  
              role of part time work as am alternative to full time employment.              
              Using 13 years of longitudinal data, the research will first                   
              involve statistical analysis of the transitions between part-                  
              timework, full-time work, and spells of non-labor force                        
              participation.  The patterns of life cycle labor force                         
              involvement that occur over time will be analyzed.  Second, the                
              project will analyze spells of part-time and full-time work as                 
              well as spells when a woman is not in the labor force, utilizing               
              state-of-the-art duration analysis techniques.  Of particular                  
              interest are the causal reasons behind the beginning and the                   
              ending of part-time labor market spells, and the relationship                  
              between labor market transitions in and out of part-time work and              
              other demographic and economic changes within a woman's                        
              household.  The results of this research will increase our                     
              understanding of life-cycle labor market decision-making, the                  
              role of part-time work in the labor market, and the labor supply               
              decisions of adult women.  It should also provide insight into                 
              the extent to which policy-makers can rely on encouraging low-                 
              skilled women to enter part-time jobs as a route toward full-time              
              employment.
