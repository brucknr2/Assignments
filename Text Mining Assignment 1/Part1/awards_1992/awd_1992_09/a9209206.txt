Abstract    :
              Conservation of biological diversity is now a global concern.  The             
              newly developing science of conservation biology seeks to enhance              
              the connections between basic ecological theory and its application            
              to conservation, thus providing sound principles for guiding                   
              conservation practice.  Support from a Career Advancement Award                
              will provide training to enable the Principal Investigator to                  
              direct future research on applied problems in the conservation and             
              management of plant communities.  Basic theory on plant succession             
              (i.e., the growth and recovery of plant communities following                  
              disturbance) will be considered for its applicability to issues of             
              plant community conservation and management.  Research time during             
              a one-year sabbatical leave will be divided between two locations:             
              1) The Institute of Ecology, University of Georgia, which has a                
              growing program in conservation ecolgy, and 2) The Savannah River              
              Ecology Laboratory, which has an established record of research on             
              plant succession and the recovery of disturbed plant communities,              
              particularly wetlands.  Specific objectives will include:  1)                  
              literature research on the existing theory of conservation and                 
              restoration in order to identify those areas most in need of futher            
              research, 2) training in methods of analyzing ecological                       
              landscapes, and 3) practical experience in plant community                     
              restoration.
