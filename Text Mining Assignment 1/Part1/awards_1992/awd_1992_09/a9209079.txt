Abstract    :
                   This award by the National Science & Technology Week (NSTW)               
              program will support the Maryland Science Center, in cooperation               
              with the State of Maryland, in its effort to plan and carry out a              
              project to focus public attention on the importance of scientific              
              education, research, and technological development in a week-long              
              educational program.  Called Maryland Science Week, this project               
              will place science and technology at the center of public attention            
              through a series of activities that could be a national model for              
              similar projects throughout the nation.  The Maryland Science                  
              Center has obtained $25,000 from the office of Governor William                
              Donald Schaefer and expects to raise an additional $50,000 from                
              Maryland's corporate community.  This $50,000 grant from the                   
              National Science Foundation will complete the $100,000 fund out of             
              which project activities may be effected.  These activities include            
              special events as well as production of materials and presentation             
              of workshops for teachers, such events as are already closely                  
              identified with the program of National Science & Technology Week              
              and which can advance the mutual goals of local and national                   
              programs of public outreach.                                                   
                   When completed, this project should provide the basis for                 
              similar partnerships between NSTW and additional states, whose                 
              projects and local funding suggest similar gains in extending                  
              public awareness of the importance of science and technology in                
              daily life and of the necessity of preparing future generations of             
              the nation's students to choose careers in these fields.
