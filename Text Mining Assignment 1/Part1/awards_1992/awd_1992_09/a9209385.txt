Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  The PI's long term goal is to study fault activity in southern            
              California using geodetic data.  The first step is to determine                
              a velocity model for southern California.  The three geodetic data             
              types which she plans to use are very long baseline interferometry             
              (VLBI), the Global Positioning System (GPS), and electronic                    
              distance measurements (EDM).  The second step is to convert these              
              surface measurements to infer slip on known faults in southern                 
              California.  Faults contribute differently to the measured surface             
              velocity depending on their slip rate and geometry.  She has worked            
              with GPS data and VLBI solutions since 1988.  She will visit and               
              work at the U.S. Geological Survey in Menlo Park where EDM data                
              collection in California was directed.
