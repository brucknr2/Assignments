Abstract    :
              This project proposes to study the taxonomic relationships among               
              the species of a group of passion flowers.  Although the genus                 
              Passiflora comprises about 450 New World species, this study will              
              focus on 70 species in the group with a common haploid chromosome              
              number of n = 9.  This group contains the majority of the showy-               
              flowered and cultivated species which have edible fruit.  The                  
              method proposed for this taxonomic study is the comparative                    
              analysis of the chlorpolast DNA using restriction site enzymes.                
              Chloroplast DNA is usually inherited only through the                          
              female plant, but chloroplasts have been reported to be present                
              in the pollen tubes of one species, so artificial hybrids will be              
              analysed with their known female and pollen parents to test the                
              inheritance pattern of the chloroplast DNA in Passiflora.                      
              Nuclear ribosomal DNA will also be used to test field collected                
              species for possible hybrid origin.  The data obtained in this                 
              study should be of use, not only to shed light on the                          
              relationships of this group of passion flowers, but also to                    
              elucidate the relationships among a group of Neotropical                       
              butterflies in the genus Heliconius whose larvae feed exclusively              
              on the leaves of Passiflora species.
