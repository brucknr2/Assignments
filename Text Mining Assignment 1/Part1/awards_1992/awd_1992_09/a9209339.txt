Abstract    :
              An experimental study is proposed to investigate the heat                      
              transfer enhancement due to longitudinal vortices in plate-fin                 
              channels of compact heat exchangers, generated by projections                  
              punched out of base fin material. Smoke injection and liquid                   
              crystal tracer particles would be used for flow and                            
              temperature field visualizations. Local and overall heat                       
              transfer coefficients and pressure drops would be obtained.                    
              Results would be documented in the form of correlations for f                  
              and Nu, that are developed on the basis of phenomenological                    
              assessment of the flow field.
