Abstract    :
                   This project consists of three research components in the                 
              general area of phase transitions and critical phenomena.  These               
              are: i)  Discrete models of interfaces in three dimensions,                    
              including a study of surface fluctuations.  ii) Percolation and                
              related ferromagnetic models, including a study of (d+1)-                      
              dimensional models with d-dimensional disorder, which arise                    
              naturally from d-dimensional disordered quantum spin systems.                  
              iii) Spin glasses, including a study of the multiplicity of pure               
              phases in short-range models.                                                  
                   These mathematical studies are geared to develop an                       
              understanding of certain important physical and technological                  
              phenomena.  Interface models arise in the study of wetting and                 
              lubrication.  Disordered quantum spin systems are being                        
              extensively used to model the effects of impurities in                         
              superconductors.  Spin glasses are closely related both to neural              
              networks (an important development in artificial  intelligence)                
              and to large scale scheduling problems such as the famed                       
              "travelling salesman problem".
