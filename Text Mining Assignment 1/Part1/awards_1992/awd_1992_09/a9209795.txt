Abstract    :
              This grant addresses a problem central to building intelligent                 
              systems, namely how to extract knowledge from data.  This                      
              problem, known as "inductive concept learning," has received much              
              attention in the machine learning community, and provides an                   
              alternative approach to the labor intensive and time consuming                 
              knowledge acquisition bottleneck by foregoing interaction with an              
              expert altogether, and instead acquiring knowledge from case                   
              libraries.  Although version spaces are one of the best known                  
              conceptual tools for concept learning, they suffer from three                  
              limitations that restrict their use as a practical tool for                    
              learning: computational intractability, noise intolerance, and                 
              representational inadequacy.  This work proposes a three layered               
              approach to overcome these limitations so that version spaces can              
              be applied to practical problems while maintaining the attractive              
              properties that make them a useful conceptual and analytical tool              
              for concept learning.
