Abstract    :
              A virtual reality system presents a user with real-time                        
              computer graphics images that correspond to the user's                         
              position and viewing direction.  In a true virtual reality                     
              system, the images are convincingly realistic.                                 
                                                                                             
              This research is concerned with the design of the software                     
              components of a true virtual reality system.  There are three                  
              facets of this design.  One is the design of the rendering                     
              system that produces the images.  The second is the design of                  
              the perceptually based display software that puts the images                   
              on display hardware.  The third is the controlling system that                 
              uses information from the display component to define the                      
              spatially dependent error bounds used by the rendering                         
              component.
