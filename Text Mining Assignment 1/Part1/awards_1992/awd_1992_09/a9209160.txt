Abstract    :
                   This research in theoretical physics is directed at many-                 
              body problems in diverse areas - nuclei, molecular dynamics,                   
              atomic clusters - which share common mathematical properties.                  
              The topics include studying the chaotic nature of large                        
              amplitude collective motion in nuclei near level crossings,                    
              propagation of many-particle systems in a random field,                        
              molecular dynamics at finite temperatures, shape transitions                   
              and electronic degrees of freedom of metallic clusters and                     
              collective motion of carbon clusters.
