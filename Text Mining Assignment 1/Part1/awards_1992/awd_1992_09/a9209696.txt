Abstract    :
                   Results from a four-year study to two chronic N-limited                   
              forests ecosystems at the Harvard Forest have shown rapid changes              
              in CH4 consumption, and the initiation of pulse losses of N20.                 
              These have occurred in synchrony with changes in N03, leaching                 
              losses, N03 and NH4 concentrations in soils, C02 efflux, and                   
              foliar nitrogen chemistry.  In this study, the principal                       
              investigators will measure C0 consumption in these same systems,               
              which they hypothesize will respond analogously to CH4                         
              consumption.  The combined changes influxes of CH4, C0) and N20                
              they expect to elicit, if representative of regional-scale                     
              responses to chronic N deposition, would contribute significantly              
              to altered atmospheric chemistry and global climate.  The PI's                 
              are well qualified to conduct this research and the facilities                 
              are excellent.
