Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This application makes use of state-of-the-art imaging techniques              
              to spatially and temporally resolve the propagation of specific                
              ionic transients.  Dr. Ross will investigate this problem by using             
              a relatively noninvasive high speed imaging system which can                   
              examine all parts of the cell simultaneously,  This optical                    
              technique can give information about specific ion concentration                
              changes and voltage changes.  The signals can be interpreted in                
              terms of the spatial distribution and propagation of dendritic                 
              events and the distribution of specific membrane channels.  Dr.                
              Ross will inject individual Purkinje cells in cerebellar slices                
              with fluorescent ion indicators and high speed images, correlated              
              with simultaneous electrical measurements made under various                   
              conditions.  The special imaging technology will be specifically               
              used for measuring intracellular calcium and sodium concentration              
              transients in fine dendritic processes.  These experiments will                
              attempt to define those factors (intrinsic membrane conductances,              
              synaptic interactions, and neuromodulators) which influence the                
              generation of local intracellular calcium changes and the                      
              propagation of regenerative potentials.  Because it is essential               
              to have information about the way synaptic inputs are integrated               
              and processed in a neuron results from this study will ultimately              
              help to better understand the cellular mechanisms of learning and              
              memory.***
