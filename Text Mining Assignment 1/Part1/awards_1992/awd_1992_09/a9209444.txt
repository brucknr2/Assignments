Abstract    :
                   This project focuses on the general problem of solving                    
              the non-linear equations arising from semiconductor device                     
              simulation and circuit simulation.  Both sequential and                        
              parallel issues arising in the solution of these equations                     
              will be examined.                                                              
                   Work has already been done on the solution of the                         
              linear equation arising from the Newton iteration in a one-                    
              dimensional device simulation.  Work will continue for a                       
              two-dimensional code.  The main ideas are (1) replacing the                    
              continuation methods currently in use with a multilevel                        
              method; and (2) developing a parallel solver for the 2D                        
              code.  This entails either showing that the classical                          
              iterative method has speed-up large enough to overcome the                     
              sequential slowness of the algorithm, or generating a good                     
              MIMD preconditioner for a Krylov subspace method.                              
                   With respect to circuit simulation, the investigation                     
              will be done in four areas.  (1) Continue the work on a                        
              taxonomy of circuits for which simulation cannot fail.  (2)                    
              Improve the non-linear solver in the circuit simulator CAzM.                   
              (3) Generate a parallel solver for large circuits.  (4) Work                   
              on blocking methods for sparsely connected circuits.                           
                   The project seeks to make a significant contribution to                   
              both the speed and the theory behind the solution of non-                      
              linear equations arising from circuit and device simulation.
