Abstract    :
                   This proposal supports a theory day to be held at New Mexico              
              State University on March 16, 1992.  The PI is a visiting faculty              
              member in the Department of Computer Science at New Mexico State               
              University and is also serving as chair of the program committee for           
              the 7th Annual Structure in Complexity Theory Conference.  The theory          
              day at NMSU is to be held in conjunction with the program committee            
              meeting to be held the weekend of March 14, 1992.  It will make an             
              important contribution to the intellectual climate of the department           
              and university, it will stimulate awareness of research activities of          
              colleagues in the region and perhaps foster the initiation of research         
              collaborations, it can serve as the catalyst for the formation of a            
              regional theory group, and it will provide important support and               
              promotion for the structures community.
