Abstract    :
                   An international workshop will be held on the major progress              
              in the last decade on the basic understanding of schemes                       
              especially for nonlinear problems in one space dimension.  This                
              involves applications to many practical problems.  However, as                 
              the problems get more difficult, e.g. hypersonic flow,                         
              combustion, nonideal gases, ect. there is an increasing need to                
              extend the basic theory to these more complicated phenomena.                   
                   This workshop will summarize the achievements of the past                 
              decade and the challenges of the next decade.
