Abstract    :
              This study examines the use of statistical evidence in the trial               
              process.  Statistical evidence, such as DNA analyses, may give                 
              rise to judgment errors, and the study investigates the                        
              conditions under which fact-finders will be most influenced by                 
              this evidence.  The first phase of the study examines the use and              
              characterization of statistical evidence in recent trial data in               
              order to identify and analyze central points of confusion and                  
              judgment errors such as the source probability error and the                   
              numerical conversion error.  The second phase is a pilot study to              
              conduct a series of experiments with mock jurors and practicing                
              judges to examine how the context, manner, and vividness of                    
              quantitative testimony from experts affect fact-finder's                       
              probabilistic judgment and verdicts.  The study will provide the               
              empirical foundation for: (1) testing the strengths and                        
              weaknesses of theories about intuitive quantitative reasoning;                 
              (2) understanding of the nature and significance of misleading                 
              claims about statistical trace evidence; (3) developing standards              
              for quantitative expert testimony; and (4) suggesting appropriate              
              quantitative training for law curricula.
