Abstract    :
              In this project, scientists at the University of Rhode Island will             
              study circulation and dynamical properties of the North Atlantic               
              Central Waters in the Newfoundland Basin.  A large scale,                      
              incoherent array of isopycnal RAFOS (Inverse SOund Fixing And                  
              Ranging) floats will be deployed to study intergyre exchange,                  
              particle dispersion, and mixing processes.  A numerical modeling               
              component will aid dynamical and thermodynamical interpretation of             
              the observations.
