Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The long term objective of this research is to define, at the                  
              molecular level, the mechanism of neurotransmitter release, neural             
              cell secretion, which is the basis for the reception of sensations,            
              thought integration and response initiation.  The approach to be               
              taken is to study the nerve ending calcium-binding proteins since              
              increased concentrations in the nerve ending appear to be the only             
              absolute requirement for release.  Unlike other, slower forms of               
              secretion, the quickness of neurotransmitter release suggests that             
              calcium-binding proteins probably are involved directly.  The                  
              project will investigate calcium binding to alpha-actinin which                
              binds F-actin and bundles actin filaments.  Also alpha-actinin                 
              which believed to occur at nerve endings.  Specifically, techniques            
              will be applied to measure 45Ca2+ binding to alpha-actinin, localize           
              the calcium binding sites, study the competition by other cations              
              for these sites, investigate conformational and functional changes             
              produced by cations using flow dialysis, gel electrophoresis,                  
              protein blotting and 45Ca overlay, column chromatography,                      
              fluorescence and circular dichroism measurements.  These studies               
              will reveal the interactions of alpha-actinin with calcium and                 
              illuminate its possible roles in neurotransmitter release.
