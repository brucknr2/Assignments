Abstract    :
              Several aspects of the relationship between concurrency and                    
              proof theory shall be investigated in this project.  In                        
              particular, theoretical connections between them shall be                      
              explored and a programming language based upon the pi-calculus                 
              will be designed and implemented using the techniques of logic                 
              programming.  This should result in both a programming                         
              language for the implementation of algorithms centered around                  
              concurrency and communication and a logical specification                      
              language for the high-level description and analysis of such                   
              software.
