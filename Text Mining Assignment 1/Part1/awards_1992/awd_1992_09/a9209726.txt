Abstract    :
              The goal of this research is to develop fast and accurate                      
              solution techniques for recursive least squares problems and                   
              analyze them through theoretical and experimental studies.                     
              These techniques will be based on accurate downdating                          
              algorithms, fast rotations, and robust direction-of-arrival                    
              estimation algorithms.  The preliminary investigations on the                  
              full rank downdating problems show that the existing                           
              algorithms vary greatly in their stability and speed.  The                     
              stability and complexity analysis will be an essential part in                 
              developing the improved algorithms and the algorithm                           
              development will utilize techniques such as fast rotations and                 
              iterative refinement.  The results will be extended to design                  
              block algorithms that can efficiently handle multiple updating                 
              and downdating simultaneously.  Although the singular value                    
              decomposition (SVD) produces excellent solutions for rank                      
              deficient problems, it is costly to calculate and modify the                   
              SVD.  The research will extend the recently developed rank                     
              revealing orthogonal decomposition, which can provide fast                     
              solutions to rank deficient recursive problems.  The results                   
              will be applied to the design of novel adaptive direction-of-                  
              arrival estimation algorithms, which are expected to produce                   
              significantly faster and accurate algorithms.  Parallel                        
              implementation of the algorithms will be conducted on the CM-5                 
              computer to establish their practical values in real time                      
              applications.
