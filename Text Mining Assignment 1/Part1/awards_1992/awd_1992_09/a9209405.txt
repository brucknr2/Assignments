Abstract    :
                   Prior research has examined applications that used shared                 
              memory in single site systems and their extension to operate in                
              a distributed environment.  The approach was to modify the                     
              underlying operating system to support a new facility for memory               
              management called distributed shared memory (DSM).  This                       
              research will relax assumptions which characterized the system                 
              as having a "tight" degree of sharing among a small number of                  
              reliable, well-behaved, communicating sites.  This assumption                  
              may not be appropriate for a large scale, typical, distributed                 
              computing environment.  Reasonably common failure modes in some                
              workstation environments include site failures and network                     
              partitions.  Prior work does not specifically address the issue                
              of communication breakages nor site failures.  This project                    
              addresses a manageable subset of these issues.                                 
                   Three issues are of concern for creating a reliable DSM                   
              system.  The first issue is to determine how sensible it is for                
              DSM to accommodate reliability extensions and for which                        
              applications this support is appropriate.  The second issue is                 
              to design and implement changes to support reliability.  It is                 
              only through the design, implementation, and use of this                       
              facility that one can gain exposure to analyzable failure modes.               
              The third research issue involves a study of the performance of                
              the reliability mechanism using a "fault induction" testing                    
              strategy.
