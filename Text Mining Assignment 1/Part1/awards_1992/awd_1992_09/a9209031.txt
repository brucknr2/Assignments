Abstract    :
              This research explores a cooperative intelligent real time control             
              architecture (CIRCA) developed by the PIs as an alternative to                 
              traditional approaches that have limited the power of the AI                   
              methods or embedded "reactivity" into an AI system to achieve real             
              time performance.  The CIRCA architecture uses separate AI and                 
              real-time subsystems to address the problems for which each is                 
              designed.  A structured interface allows the subsystems to                     
              communicate without compromising their respective performance                  
              goals.  By reasoning about its own bounded reactivity, CIRCA can               
              guarantee that it will meet hard deadlines while using AI methods              
              whose time performance need not be accurately predictable.  With               
              its abilities to guarantee or trade off the timeliness, precision,             
              confidence, and completeness of its output, CIRCA should provide               
              more flexible performance than traditional systems.  This project              
              will develop the cooperative theory which supports CIRCA's                     
              performance guarantees as well as its experimental implementation              
              and evaluation.  The main emphasis is on CIRCA's ability to combine            
              AI and real-time subsystems.
