Abstract    :
              This research project addresses the problem of grasp planning and              
              object manipulation. An innovative technique for effectively                   
              calculating the finger forces to be applied to the grasped object              
              is developed.  The CAD model of a dexterous robotic hand, task                 
              specification, and a contact model (e.g., soft finger contact with             
              friction), are used to yield a stable grasp suitable for the task.             
              If the desired grasp cannot be achieved in the initial phase, for              
              example due to presence of nearby obstacles, the system                        
              autonomously plans and executes dexterous manipulation actions to              
              gain the desired grasp. The results of this research will solve                
              the inherently complex grasp problem in a computational efficient              
              and physically meaningful manner.*** //
