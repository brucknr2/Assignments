Abstract    :
                   This research involves parallel computation for simultaneous              
              optimization of cell layout and intercell material flow paths.  A              
              simultaneous design of cell layout and intercell material flow                 
              paths provides a more detailed picture for a rapidly analyzing                 
              alternative configurations compared to treating block layout design            
              and material flow design as separate or sequential problems.  Two              
              modes of parallel computation will be used:  (1) intrinsic parallel            
              approach, which will be based on a genetic algorithm and (2)                   
              vectorization approach for parallel computation of a hill climbing             
              algorithm, which will be experimented on a supercomputer                       
                   Object-oriented programming is used for the problem                       
              representation and user interface.  Because of the emphasis on                 
              parallel computation and application of stochastic global search               
              methods, the approach is expected to have a high probability of                
              finding near optimal solutions for medium to large problem sizes               
              which are typically encountered in practice.
