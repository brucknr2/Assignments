Abstract    :
                   This research centers on extensions and refinements of large              
              deviations theory, especially motivated by applications to                     
              problems of communication and control, to comparative analysis of              
              molecular (DNA and protein) sequences, and to studies of queueing              
              processes and sequential experimentation.  Among the expected                  
              results are new limit theorems for distributions conditioned on                
              rare events of exponentially small probabilities, and the novel                
              analysis of the empirical law of segments of Markov processes and              
              Markov random fields that are selected by means of appropriate                 
              stopping times.  Another promising new approach is based on using              
              association inequalities (of the FKG type), and exchangeability                
              as tools for obtaining large deviations bounds.  These bounds are              
              applicable for the estimation of time-varying parameters and for               
              comparing sampling schemes in terms of rare events probabilities.              
                   This research centers on estimating the chances for rare                  
              events to occur, in areas where such events are of fundamental                 
              importance.  Examples include assessing statistical significance               
              of unusual DNA sequence segment compositions, analysis of long                 
              waiting times in complex queueing systems, and analysis of                     
              parallel computer systems.
