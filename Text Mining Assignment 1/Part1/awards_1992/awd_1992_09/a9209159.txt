Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  This is a study of the ways in which careers and wages are                
              affected by the mobility of workers within labor markets.  Most                
              jobs are located within an occupation and within an organization               
              or firm.  The wages paid in a job may depend both on                           
              characteristics of the occupation and the firm, depending on the               
              resources characteristic for the occupation and firm.  This study              
              will examine how such labor market resources affect wages                      
              independently of individual characteristics of the individual                  
              holding the job (education, age, effort, for example).  The study              
              will be based on data from the Current Population Surveys and the              
              National Longitudinal Survey of Youth.                                         
                                                                                             
                   This research will contribute to our understanding of how                 
              labor market structures (occupations and firms) may influence the              
              wages paid to workers and in particular how the effects of an                  
              individual's skill, education, and effort may be modified by the               
              occupational labor market or firm labor market he or she is                    
              working in.
