Abstract    :
                   Numerical simulation is an important tool for predicting the              
              behavior of physical systems.  Many powerful numerical simulation              
              programs exist today.  However, using these programs to reliably               
              analyze a physical situation requires considerable human effort and            
              expertise to set up a simulation, determine whether the output makes           
              sense, and repeatedly run the simulation with different inputs until a         
              satisfactory result is achieved.  Automating this process is not only          
              of considerable practical importance but will also significantly               
              advance basic AI research in reasoning about the physical world.  This         
              project will address these problems of setup, analysis, quality                
              assurance, and feedback for numerical simulation.
