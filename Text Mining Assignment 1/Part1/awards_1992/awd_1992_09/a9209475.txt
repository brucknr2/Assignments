Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              One of the most exciting recent advances in the field of behavioral            
              ecology is the application of molecular genetic techniques to answer           
              critical questions concerning relative reproductive success of                 
              various classes of individuals in populations.  Evolutionary                   
              interpretations of results of early studies have had to rely on                
              various assumptions about mating patterns, some of which have                  
              subsequently been shown to be erroneous using these new techniques.            
                                                                                             
              I propose to learn to use these techniques (especially DNA                     
              fingerprinting) so that I may answer questions of paternity for                
              studies on the behavioral ecology of lizards, a group of organisms             
              currently under-represented in the behavioral ecology literature yet           
              well-suited to such studies.  Reptiles are an important group to               
              include in comparative studies of the evolution of mating systems              
              and social behavior since they represent a bridge between the                  
              ectothermic vertebrates and the reproductively terrestrial                     
              vertebrates.  After learning these techniques at the Genetics                  
              Laboratory of the National Zoo, I plan to undertake a behavioral               
              study on alternative mating tactics, followed by paternity analysis.           
              The paternity analysis would take place in the common-use Laboratory           
              of Evolutionary and Ecological Genetics, currently under development           
              in Biology at NMSU, and would test my ability.
