Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This project attempts to develop a theoretical framework for                   
              analyzing different aspects of the internal organization structure             
              of large firms, as well as of contractual nexuses among firms.                 
              Particular aspects analyzed include: hierarchical delegation of                
              authority to design (sub)contracts, the breadth and depth of                   
              hierarchies, planning and supervision activities of managers,                  
              organizational diseconomies of scale, transfer pricing mechanisms,             
              and the grouping of activities into different divisions.                       
                                                                                             
              The approach adopted is to suppose that information regarding cost             
              and market conditions is dispersed among different agents in the               
              organization, and that they can communicate with one another in a              
              restricted manner.  Managers act strategically with respect to                 
              their private information.  The organization is thus characterized             
              by a decentralized decision-making mechanism which strikes a                   
              balance between the advantages of adaption to location information,            
              and the disadvantage of control losses arising from managerial                 
              incentive problems.                                                            
                                                                                             
              The short-term goal of the research is to develop consistent                   
              theoretical models of the above mentioned aspects of organizational            
              structure.  In the long run these models should generate                       
              predictions regarding the connection between organizational                    
              structure, and more fundamental characteristics such as the nature             
              of technology, information structure, production scale, product                
              demand, and product market competition.
