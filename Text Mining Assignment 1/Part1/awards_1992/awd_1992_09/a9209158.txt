Abstract    :
              Professor Robinson is studying a mainstream area of biological                 
              research in order to describe better the course of biology's                   
              development and to analyze the issues involved in the workings of              
              experimental science.  In order to carry out this research, he has             
              selected case studies that represent experimental approaches to                
              determining the mechanisms responsible (i) for creating the                    
              asymmetric distribution of Na+ and K+ between cells and their                  
              environments and (ii) for linking the oxidation of nutrients to the            
              production of ATP by the cell mitochondria.  These inquires                    
              converged in formulations of active transport across biological                
              membranes, and led to the recognition of ATP-utilizing enzymes that            
              create ion gradients, ATP-synthesizing enzymes that consume ion                
              gradients, and the role of both ATP and ion gradients as potential             
              energy reservoirs for driving cellular function.  The case studies             
              also represent the variety of experimental origins and outcomes:               
              theory-driven and serendipitous discovery, falsification and                   
              immunity to falsification, corroboration, controversy, consensus               
              formation, and the attainment of conceptual unity through the                  
              reductionist program.  The goals of this project include drawing to            
              the attention of historians and philosophers of science such                   
              ordinary practice, and illustrating to working scientists some                 
              practical and theoretical aspects of their toils--including causes             
              and consequences of success and failure in rival research programs.
