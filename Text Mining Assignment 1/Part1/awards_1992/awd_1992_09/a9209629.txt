Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The goal of this research is to elucidate the mechanisms by which              
              dopaminergic (DA) and cholinergic (ACh) neurotransmitter systems               
              interact in the neural bases of cognitive function.  In previous               
              studies, Dr. Levin has documented the interactions of DA and ACh               
              drugs given systemically.  The current proposal is to investigate              
              critical neural pathways which underlie these DA-ACh interactions.             
              Sites to be studied are those which are important for cognitive                
              function and where DA and ACh systems are anatomically connected.              
              These include the septal nucleus, the nucleus basalis and the                  
              ventral tegmental area.  These studies will help achieve the goal              
              of elucidating basic mechanisms of DA-ACh interactions in cognitive            
              behavior.  This is important to further develop basic understanding            
              of the neural bases of cognitive function.  Since no neural system             
              acts alone, it is important to understand how they act together.//
