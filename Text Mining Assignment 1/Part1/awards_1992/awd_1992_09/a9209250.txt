Abstract    :
                   The objectives of this Career Advancement Award are to                    
              facilitate the principal investigator's career transition from                 
              industry to a university environment; enhance her research                     
              capability in computer-aided concurrent engineering; and to support            
              exploratory work on artificial intelligence based decision support             
              for cooperative design.                                                        
                   The exploratory work will involve the design of a testbed for             
              simulating and analyzing the cooperative design process and for                
              experimenting with strategies for its decision support.  The domain            
              for this work is the simultaneous process selection and design for             
              manufacturability of thin-walled parts.  Interaction with                      
              industrial sponsors will be used to extend the work to other                   
              environments.
