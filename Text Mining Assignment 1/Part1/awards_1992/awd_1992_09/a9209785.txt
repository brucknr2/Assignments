Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              There are many transmitter substances which regulate the activity              
              of nerve cells of the central nervous system.  The objective of                
              this proposal is to elucidate the mechanisms by which these                    
              transmitter substances activate intracellular messenger processes              
              that lead to the modulation of excitability through their action on            
              potassium channel conductance properties.  Recent studies have                 
              shown that excitability of neurons is dependent on potassium                   
              channels which are, in turn, regulated by G-proteins called Gi and             
              Go, of which there are several subtypes.  The specific aim of this             
              investigation is to identify which of the G-protein subtypes are               
              related to neurotransmitter action (acetylcholine and                          
              somatostatin).  Molecular biological techniques will be used to                
              produce specific mutations to selectively inactivate G-proteins and            
              thereby determine which of them is directly affected by the                    
              neurotransmitters to act on potassium conductance of the cell.  For            
              this purpose mutated alpha subunits will be inserted into AtT-20               
              cells, a pituitary tumor cell line which contain G-protein                     
              regulated potassium channels.  The effect of the mutants can then              
              be ascertained on potassium channel function.
