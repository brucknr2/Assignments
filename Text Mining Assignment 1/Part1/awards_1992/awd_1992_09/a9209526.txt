Abstract    :
                   It is well understood that randomness in manufacturing systems            
              is a common occurrence due to machine breakdowns, maintenance and              
              many other factors.  Recent studies show that jump diffusions are              
              good approximations for these analytically intractable systems.                
              The objective of this research is to model and analyze the                     
              stochastic resource allocation problem in multiple class jump                  
              diffusion networks which arise in production systems and computer              
              communication networks.                                                        
                   A stochastic intensity model allows resource allocation                   
              problems to be described in terms of intensity scheduling and drift            
              control.  With such a framework, schedulings in discrete queueing              
              network model and fluid network model turn out to be special cases.            
              This research will characterize, compute, and search for heuristics            
              of the optimal allocation rule by defining allocation rules using              
              state space decomposition and finding sufficient optomality                    
              condition on the defined control sets.  Intuitive scheduling                   
              control rules will be obtained by simulation; and the conjectured              
              results will be verified using discrete time approximation.
