Abstract    :
                Hashing techniques are used extensively in databases and file                
              structures, text retrieval systems, and in hardware. This                      
              research is addressing the fundamental question of the                         
              relationship between the results of probabilistic analysis of                  
              hashing techniques and their practical performance. The goals                  
              include investigating:  (1) if and how the analytical performance              
              can be achieved in practice; (2) the effect of different                       
              distributions of the key sets; and (3) application of hashing and              
              perfect hashing to hardware implementation. Preliminary results                
              obtained thus far are promising and indicate that the analytical               
              performance can indeed be achieved in practice. These fundamental              
              results are useful in other areas such as in signature files for               
              text searching and parallel hashing. By addressing the long open               
              question in the area of hashing, this research enables the users               
              of hashing techniques to have a formal basis for file design and               
              confidence in the expected performance of the resulting file                   
              structures.
