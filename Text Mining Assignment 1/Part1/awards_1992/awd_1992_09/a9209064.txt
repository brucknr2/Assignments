Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  This research will provide critical operational support and               
              related scientific applications for TOGA/COARE using McIDAS (Man-              
              computer Interactive Data Access System) workstations.  The                    
              TOGA/COARE Intensive Observing Period (IOP) will take place in a               
              data sparse region of the far Western Tropical Pacific from                    
              November 92 through February 93.  TOGA/COARE must rely on satellite            
              imagery and global circulation model (GCM) analyses and forecasts              
              for making daily operational decisions during the IOP.  McIDAS is              
              the most advanced tool for synthesizing satellite imagery with                 
              thermodynamic and dynamic fields anlayzed by GCM and and regional              
              models.                                                                        
                                                                                             
                   As part of this project, scientific and logistic support will             
              be provided during the IOP with two dedicated McIDAS workstations.             
              Most data will be obtained from the Bureau of Meteorology McIDAS in            
              Australia with some additions from the Wisconsin McIDAS through                
              Internet.  McIDAS workstations will be placed at two key locations:            
              the COARE Operations Center in Townsville, Queensland, Australia               
              and in Honiara, Guadacanal, Solomon Islands, where critical                    
              operational decisions will be made.                                            
                                                                                             
                   Besides providing all available data, analyses, and forecasts             
              during the IOP, this project includes a series of pre-IOP and past             
              IOP studies.  The pre-IOP study will compare GCM analyses and                  
              forecasts to satellite imagery from the year before COARE to                   
              evaluate the models and assess forecasting skill.  The past IOP                
              study will focus on summarizing the weather and cloud events of the            
              IOP and completing the GCM evaluations begun in the pre-IOP.  The              
              comparisons of analyses and model forecasts made during the IOP.
