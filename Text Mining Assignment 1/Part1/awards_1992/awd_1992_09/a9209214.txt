Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  Housing is a scarce and valued resource particularly in the               
              urban agglomerations of less developed countries. This study will              
              examine access to housing and the quality of neighborhoods in                  
              which people live in a large Chinese city, Tianjin.  Chinese                   
              cities have developed over the last forty years within a state                 
              socialist framework where an egalitarian ideology was promoted,                
              and organized systems of housing and service allocation were                   
              based on public rather than private investments.  The central                  
              research questions guiding this study is what inequalities in                  
              housing and urban infrastructure survive in such a system, and                 
              what are the factors associated with more favorable outcomes,                  
              that is better housing and better neighborhoods.                               
                   This study will provide important insights into the bases of              
              inequality characteristic of a state socialist economic system.                
              It also provides a crucial baseline for future studies on the                  
              impact on the transition to a market economy which is beginning                
              in China.
