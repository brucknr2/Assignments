Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The goal of this workshop is to explore the new emerging view that             
              the mind must be viewed in its social and physical context.  In                
              this view, the processes and representations of the internal                   
              cognitive system are tightly coupled with processes and                        
              representations in the external world.  In other words, cognition              
              is not about the mind in isolation, but the mind tightly coupled               
              with the external world that consists of the natural environment,              
              designed artifacts, the social environment, the organizational                 
              environment, and the cultural environment.  The workshop will                  
              convene representatives of a number of specific lines of work that             
              converge on this view, including situated action, distributed                  
              cognition, cultural psychology, everyday cognition, activity views             
              of the mind, the study of errors, and studies of applications like             
              human-computer interaction and computer-supported cooperative work.            
              Such disciplines as artificial intelligence, psychology,                       
              linguistics, anthropology, and philosophy are all active in these              
              debates.  The outcome will include a report for the National                   
              Science Foundation's planning for a Cognitive Science Initiative.
