Abstract    :
              The focus of this research is on                                               
              the signal processing techniques                                               
              needed to develop a new imaging                                                
              modality to detect the current                                                 
              distribution that exists within the                                            
              body. This modality is based on the                                            
              passive measurement of the magnetic                                            
              fields of the body.  The                                                       
              investigators will develop                                                     
              mathematical and physical models to                                            
              solve the magnetic inverse problem,                                            
              compute the current distribution,                                              
              locate the position of the                                                     
              conductors in 3-D free space, and                                              
              reconstruct the image of the                                                   
              current distributions in a bounded                                             
              conduction medium.                                                             
                                                                                             
              This research is important since it                                            
              will contribute to an imaging                                                  
              modality that is totally                                                       
              noninvasive and which has the                                                  
              potential to measure physiological                                             
              events (currents) which cannot be                                              
              detected by any of the present                                                 
              medical imaging devices.  The main                                             
              application of this imaging                                                    
              modality is expected to be in                                                  
              tracking the electrical activity of                                            
              the heart and the brain.
