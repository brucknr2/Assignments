Abstract    :
                   This project begins the preliminary research in the                       
              development and implementation of optimal Bayesian experimental                
              designs based on expert opinion and informative priors.  Expansions            
              from fixed designs derived from fractional factorial designs will              
              include sequential designs for response surfaces and designs for               
              yield optimization.  The role and practicalities of prior                      
              elicitation processes will also be examined.                                   
                   Bayesian statistical methodology allows direct incorporation              
              of expert opinion or of good prior information, as is often                    
              available for experiments in physical science and manufacturing.               
              This project will develop Bayesian optimal designs for experiments             
              for response surface models, for yield optimization and for                    
              particular application with the Taguchi method.
