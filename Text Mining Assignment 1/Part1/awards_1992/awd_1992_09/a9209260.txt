Abstract    :
              While the role of randomization in algorithms design has not                   
              been fully understood, several important computational                         
              problems have been solved elegantly using randomization.  The                  
              best known randomized algorithms for a variety of problems                     
              have better resource bounds than their deterministic                           
              counterparts.  The research addresses the issue of a better                    
              understanding of randomization, by studying its function in                    
              the design of parallel algorithms for three critical computing                 
              problems, 1) Sorting and Selection, 2) Packet Routing, and 3)                  
              Combinatorial Optimization.  Optimal or near optimal parallel                  
              algorithms for these three problems on various models of                       
              parallel computing will be designed.  Sampling and algorithmic                 
              tools developed in this project will find applications in such                 
              diverse areas as natural language processing, computer                         
              simulation, motion planning, etc.//
