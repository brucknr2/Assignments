Abstract    :
                 Recognizing objects from a single view is hard, because their               
              appearance depends crucially on the direction from which they are              
              viewed.  Curved surfaces are particularly subject to this effect.              
              This research concentrates on recognizing curved surfaces from                 
              their outline in a single perspective image, using both                        
              theoretical studies and practical implementations, along two                   
              lines of investigation.  The problem has already been solved for               
              generic algebraic surfaces by the Principal Investigator.  The                 
              result indicates that an image outline contains substantial                    
              amounts of information about an object's shape.  The research                  
              will investigate extending this result to a wider range of                     
              popular surfaces, and will also investigate the practicalities of              
              applying the resulting algorithms.  Recent work by the PI and                  
              colleagues suggests that there is a large range of surface models              
              which are intrinsically easy to recognize.  These results suggest              
              building a surface modeller oriented specifically towards                      
              computer vision applications, where the resulting models would be              
              a fortiori easy to identify from any view.  The research will                  
              investigate theoretical issues involved in constructing such a                 
              modeller, and will implement simple modelling system with these                
              properties.
