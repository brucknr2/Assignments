Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This is a proposal to conduct two workshops and an international               
              conference on the development of a Human Genetic Diversity project.            
              Human genetic diversity holds the key to understanding the                     
              evolution of our species.  By documenting genetic variation we will            
              be able to decipher the forces that guided our evolution and the               
              paths down which it proceeded. The data will be significant for                
              both biological scientists and medical researchers.  With the                  
              advent of new techniques for manipulating nucleic acids there has              
              never been a better time for gathering this data but the                       
              disappearance of many aboriginal populations places a time                     
              constraint on the gathering of the information.  These sessions                
              will bring together mathematical population geneticists,                       
              statisticians, population biologists and physical anthropologists              
              to develop appropriate strategies for undertaking the data                     
              gathering phase, storage techniques, standardization of protocols              
              as well as considering which population samples would be most                  
              informative.
