Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The long term goal of his project is to understand the molecular               
              mechanisms underlying the development of the mammalian central                 
              nervous system.  Many physiological factors influence the                      
              development of the central nervous system.    Among these factors,             
              thyroid hormones are known to be absolutely essential for proper               
              development.   The actions of thyroid hormones are mediated through            
              nuclear receptors, which regulate the expression of specific target            
              genes in response to hormone binding.  However, the genes that are             
              regulated by thyroid hormones in the developing brain are largely              
              unknown.  The main objective of this proposal is to identify the               
              targets of thyroid hormone receptor action in the brain during a               
              time frame that is critical for proper development.  Target genes              
              will be isolate using subtractive hybridization coupled with                   
              polymerase chain reaction amplification to identify genes that are             
              expressed in euthyroid but not hypothyroid animals.  These genes               
              will then be characterized with respect to their patterns of                   
              expression and nucleotide sequence.  Using a molecular approach to             
              focus on a class of genes that are likely to be important for                  
              central nervous system development will significantly advance our              
              understanding of the effects of differential gene expression on the            
              developing nervous system.  The identification and isolation of                
              thyroid hormone responsive genes, coupled with characterization of             
              the proteins they encode, is an essential first step in realizing              
              the ultimate goals of this proposal.
