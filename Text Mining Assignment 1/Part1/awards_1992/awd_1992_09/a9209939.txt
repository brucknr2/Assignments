Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Neurons extend two distinct types of neurites, axons, and                      
              dendrites.  Axons are highly specialized to transmit information               
              over long distances, whereas dendrites are highly specialized to               
              receive and process information.  A growing body of evidence                   
              indicates that the more overt differences between these neurites               
              derive from underlying differences in their cytoskeletal structure,            
              and in particular of their microtubules.  Microtubules are                     
              filamentous proteins that have important functions in cellular                 
              architecture and motility.  In recent years, considerable effort               
              has been devoted toward understanding the regulation and functions             
              of microtubules in the axon.  In contrast, dendritic microtubules              
              are poorly studied.  The experiments in this application will                  
              explore the role of MAP-2, a somatodendritic-specific                          
              microtubule-associated protein in the organization and stability               
              properties of dendritic microtubules.  Other experiments will                  
              explore the potential role of microtubules in regulating organelle             
              transport in the dendrite.  These studies will resolve important               
              issues about dendritic microtubules, and will thereby provide new              
              insights into the mechanisms that generate and maintain neuronal               
              polarity.  Information of this kind is essential for understanding             
              the cell biology of the neuron, and for elucidating the causes and             
              potential cures for neuropathologies involving retardation of                  
              dendritic growth, and/or loss of neuronal polarity.
