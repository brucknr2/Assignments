Abstract    :
              The objective of this project is to                                            
              improve the lateral resolution of                                              
              ultrasonic echo scanners for use in                                            
              mammography.  Presently, the                                                   
              resolution is limited to a few mm                                              
              due to diffraction-induced                                                     
              wavefront distortions.  To improve                                             
              the resolution of very large                                                   
              transducers it should be possible                                              
              to compensate for the distortions                                              
              by using adaptive weight control                                               
              techniques.  With these techniques                                             
              a ten-fold improvement in the                                                  
              present resolution of commercial                                               
              systems should be able to be                                                   
              achieved.                                                                      
                                                                                             
              This project will first investigate                                            
              the 1 D transmission problem                                                   
              followed by 2D transmission and 2D                                             
              reflection studies. Ultrasound is a                                            
              relatively low-cost imaging                                                    
              modality, however, improvements in                                             
              the lateral resolution are needed                                              
              before this modality can be used                                               
              more widely in the medical field.
