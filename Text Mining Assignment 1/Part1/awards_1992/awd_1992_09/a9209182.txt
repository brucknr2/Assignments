Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The project aims at interpreting long- and medium-run productivity             
              dynamics in light of various realistic factor market imperfections.            
              In endogenous growth models, productivity dynamics are driven by               
              private optimal decisions to invest in physical capital or                     
              knowledge.  A lower income share for accumulated factors such as               
              physical capital and new knowledge implies lesser incentives to                
              save rather than consume, and slower productivity growth if private            
              optimal investment decisions are the engine of growth.  Income                 
              shares may in turn be explained in light of imperfectly competitive            
              factor market interactions.                                                    
                                                                                             
              This research will seek interpretations for the post-1973 worldwide            
              productivity slowdown.  Non-accumulated production factors such as             
              natural resources and labor enjoyed higher shares of worldwide                 
              production in the 1970s.  This may be explained in terms of changes            
              in factor market structure, with a prominent role for insider power            
              in unionized labor markets and cartelization of natural resource               
              markets.
