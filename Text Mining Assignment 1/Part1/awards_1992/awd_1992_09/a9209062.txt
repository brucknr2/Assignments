Abstract    :
              The award will support "The Second International Conference on                 
              Bioinformatics, Supercomputing and Complex Genome Analysis", to be             
              held in St. Petersburg Beach, Florida, from June 4-7, 1992.  The               
              aim of this conference is to proved a forum in which experts from              
              both the academic and industrial sectors, including new researchers            
              and students, can gather to interact.  This will afford them an                
              opportunity to gain first hand knowledge of the scope, direction,              
              and future prospects of informatics and computing in complex genome            
              analysis.  The interdisciplinary nature of the conference is                   
              designed to foster an exchange of ideas and information among                  
              disciplines and to lead to a transfer of technologies, especially              
              from the academic sector to industry.  The focus of the conference             
              will be on the computational and experimental aspects of complex               
              biological molecular analysis. The subject areas cover databases               
              and languages, computer techniques for analysis of data (e.g.                  
              neural-net, pattern recognition), computer modeling and graphics               
              visualization, and experimental approaches such as mapping and                 
              cloning.
