Abstract    :
              This Science in Developing Countries award will                                
              support a Roundtable on Molecular Biology and                                  
              Biochemistry of Chemolithotrophs:  Applications                                
              to Bacterials Leaching, to be held in New                                      
              Orleans, Louisiana, May 26-30, 1992.  The                                      
              organizers are Moselio Schaechter of the American                              
              Society for Microbiology and Emilio Garcia, a                                  
              Chilean scientist at the Lawrence Livermore                                    
              National Laboratory, University of California.                                 
                                                                                             
              The Roundtable will bring together scientists                                  
              from the United States and Latin America to                                    
              discuss a range of fundamental research topics                                 
              focusing on chemolithotrophs.  Through this                                    
              award, seven researchers--of whom some are young                               
              investigators--from developing countries in Latin                              
              America will participate.  The Roundtable is                                   
              expected to benefit both the U.S. and Latin                                    
              American participants through an exchange of                                   
              information and the opportunity to develop new                                 
              ties in collaborative research, leading to                                     
              further progress in metals production and                                      
              recovery, a field of commercial importance to all                              
              countries involved.
