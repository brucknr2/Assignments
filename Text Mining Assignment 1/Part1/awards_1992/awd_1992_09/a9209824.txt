Abstract    :
                   The intent of this research is to develop and demonstrate                 
              viable methodologies for manufacturing applications of a                       
              Multivariate Cost of Poor Quality Loss Function (MVCOPQLF).  The               
              MVCOPQLF is derived from a newly developed framework, known as the             
              Cost of Poor Quality Matrix.  This framework integrates established            
              cost of quality concepts with the intent of Taguchi's Loss Function            
              model.  Production scheduling results generated from MVCOPQLfs will            
              be tested for sensitivity to transition paths and performance                  
              characteristic target values.  Applications of the MVCOPQLF is a               
              discrete parts manufacturing facility will also be modeled and                 
              demonstrated.                                                                  
                   The anticipated result is the advancement of the understanding            
              and practicability of the loss function concept to one which may               
              be used in industry to evaluate and optimize a wide range of                   
              operating decisions.  Completion of this research will elevate the             
              loss function concept to one which may, if properly implemented,               
              substantially advance the way producers look at manufacturing                  
              activities -- a level where explicit consideration of cost of poor             
              quality yields positive long-term results, and far less loss to                
              society as a whole.
