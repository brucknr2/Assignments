Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  This Research Planning Grant will be used to extend previous              
              work on the use of social science reasoning in decision making                 
              processes in regulatory agencies by adding data for the EEOC and               
              the EPA to an existing data base.  The planning activities                     
              include developing a computerized data base, the development of a              
              sampling frame, and the development of a coding scheme for                     
              documentary and in-depth interview data.  The research proposal                
              resulting from these planning activites will outline a study of                
              the ways in which social science expertices is incorporated into               
              some areas of regulatory law.  This study in turn will contribute              
              to our understanding of the ways in which regulatory agencies                  
              make decisions.
