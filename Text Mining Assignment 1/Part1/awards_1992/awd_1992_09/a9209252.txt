Abstract    :
                Human database designers apply their accumulated experience and              
              commonsense reasoning abilities to each new design task. Recently,             
              a number of expert systems have been developed that attempt to                 
              automate the database design process. Although these systems may               
              have a high degree of expertise in database design, they typically             
              know very little about anything else. As a result, they often have             
              to ask questions that appear unnecessary or trivial, thus                      
              detracting from their credibility as experts and increasing the                
              effort required of the user. The objective of this research is to              
              add commonsense reasoning capabilities to a proven database design             
              expert system. The commonsense reasoner will employ a simple,                  
              generic model of the business environment that it can extend semi-             
              automatically with facts "learned" during each design session.                 
              The project involves conceptual work on the nature and                         
              representation of commonsense knowledge as the basis for a later               
              implementation. The implemented system will be tested to assess the            
              value of the commonsense facility. This research is expected to aid            
              in designing computer systems that combine a high degree of                    
              expertise in a particular subject with general knowledge about the             
              world at large and have the ability to apply both to solving                   
              problems.
