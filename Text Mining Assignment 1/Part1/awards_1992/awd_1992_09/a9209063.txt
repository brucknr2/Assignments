Abstract    :
                   This award continues support for the principal investigator's             
              research on 'idempotent relations between mathematical objects'.               
              This research generalizes and unifies the past work of Brauer on               
              class numbers and of Accola on genera of Riemann surfaces.  This               
              research, set in the context of group schemes of finite type over              
              the integers, explores the compatibility of certain conjectures                
              such as those of Birch-Swinnerton-Dyer and of Tate having                      
              idempotent relations in group rings.                                           
                   This research is in the general area of number theory.  Number            
              theory is one of the oldest branches of research in the                        
              mathematical sciences.  It concerns the basic structure of the                 
              integers, extensions of the integers, and the fundamental structure            
              of the fields in which they lie.  Research tools require a                     
              sophisticated blend of analysis, geometry, and algebra.
