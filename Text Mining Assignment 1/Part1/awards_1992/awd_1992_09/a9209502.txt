Abstract    :
              The goal of this research is the development, implementation and               
              evaluation of efficient numerical methods for certain partial                  
              differential equations on high performance parallel                            
              architectures.  Problems studied will include the time-dependent               
              Schrodinger equation,  the Poisson-Boltzmann equation and a                    
              (simplified) global spectral model from meteorology.  The                      
              Schrodinger equation ap?ears in various application areas such as              
              computational chemistry, atomic physics molecular dynamics, and                
              also in certain approaches to modeling acoustic propagation in                 
              the ocean and in optics.                                                       
                                                                                             
              The families of numerical methods to be considered include                     
              operator splitting methods (e.g. ADI), multigrid, spectral                     
              methods, cyclic reduction and Pade-based like preconditioned                   
              Krylov subspace methods will be included.  In this project, the                
              PI will build upon past experience with the Intel hypercubes, the              
              Connection Machine, multiprocessor Crays and the Alliant, to                   
              develop and implement parallel methods for the new generation of               
              parallel supercomputers, such as the CM5 and the Intel Touchstone              
              machines.  This research will shed light on what numerical                     
              methods are appropriate for high performance parallel                          
              architectures.
