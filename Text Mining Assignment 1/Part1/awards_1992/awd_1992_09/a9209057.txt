Abstract    :
              Current Optical Character Recognition (OCR) technology is                      
              considerably better than that of five years ago, but it is still               
              not at a level of accuracy needed for widespread practical                     
              applications.  If OCR systems are to be a useful alternative to                
              skilled human typists, the error rates of the machine must be                  
              reduced by one to two orders of magnitude.  This project applies               
              new approaches to the problem.  The problem is here approached by              
              modeling the various steps in the character recognition process and            
              then developing analytical techniques for each step.  The project              
              will continue research on extracting features directly from gray               
              scale images (as compared with the usual method involving                      
              binarization of the images before recognition).  The research will             
              also address construction of character prototypes and development              
              of flexible graph matching algorithms taking into account both                 
              typeface specifications and the characteristics of distortions and             
              noise encountered in the printing process.
