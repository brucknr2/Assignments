Abstract    :
              This Career Advancement Award will enable Dr. Jeanne McHale to                 
              pursue a one year pilot study developing resonance raman                       
              approaches to the Stark effect. Past approaches have used less                 
              informative electronic spectroscopic approaches. Results of                    
              Raman studies of this kind will provide structural information                 
              which has been hitherto unavailable. Dr. McHale has developed a                
              productive program in Raman Spectroscopy and has constructed                   
              most of the necessary equipment to do this kind of work.                       
              Funding of this project is timely because it will enable her to                
              establish herself at the lead of a potentially extremely                       
              important new direction in her research.                                       
              %%%This proposal builds a research program in the study of how                 
              electric fields distort the structures of molecules. Such                      
              information is important to the understanding of many aspects                  
              of biochemical phenomena and of catalytic processes of                         
              industrial significance.
