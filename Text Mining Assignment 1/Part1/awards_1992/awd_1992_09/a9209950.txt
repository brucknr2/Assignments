Abstract    :
                   The proposed research is a molecular genetic study of the Y               
              chromosome in mammals.  A study of the Y chromosome is of special              
              interest because, unlike other chromosome, it is inherited only                
              from father to son.  For this reason, the Y chromosome may be                  
              useful in tracing paternal lineages through mammalian populations              
              and species.  The primary objective of the proposed research is to             
              investigate how DNA sequences on the Y chromosome provide                      
              information about relatedness among mammalian species.  A genetic              
              locus from the Y chromosome will be studied in species of "Old                 
              World" mice from Africa, Asia Australia and Europe.  Relationships             
              among these mice will be determined by comparing variation in the              
              DNA sequence of this genetic locus; the greater the similarity in              
              DNA, the more closely related the species.  The results from this              
              study will be compared to relationships among these same mice                  
              determined using genetic markers that trace maternal (mother to                
              daughter) lineages.  The proposed research represents a novel                  
              approach to increasing our understanding of the relationships and              
              diversity of mammalian species.  The PI is well qualified to                   
              conduct this research and the university of Michigan is an                     
              excellent institution for the research.
