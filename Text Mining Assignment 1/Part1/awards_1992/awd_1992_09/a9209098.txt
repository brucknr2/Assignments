Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              A framing effect occurs whenever a person is influenced by the way             
              in which information is described or presented (framed).  This                 
              Research Planning Grant will assist in the development of a                    
              research program which provides an intensive evaluation of                     
              differences in the encoding and processing of information as a                 
              function of positive and negative frames.  Recent evidence within              
              the domain of decision making under risk and related research in               
              psychology suggests that complex cognitive differences may exist in            
              response to information that is perceived as positive or negative.             
                                                                                             
              Several potential measures of positive and negative framing effects            
              will be examined to establish their usefulness and feasibility.                
              These measures include assessments of preferences in risky choice,             
              information acquisition and use, response consistency, response                
              times, changes in attitude, attentional biases and memory effects.             
              Studies will be proposed within typical experimental frameworks and            
              well as within the context of mass media.  The overriding goal is              
              to increase our knowledge of how cognition is influenced by the                
              framing of information.
