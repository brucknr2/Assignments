Abstract    :
                   In conjunction with the Public Agenda Foundation, The                     
              Business-Higher Education Forum has created a unique public-                   
              information campaign, "Crisis in the Work Force:  Help Wanted."                
              The campaign's goals are to help the American people better                    
              understand the links between inadequate workforce skills and                   
              declining competitiveness--and from there to do something to                   
              address the problem in their own communities.  Citizens will have              
              a chance to be involved in recommendations to develop a                        
              scientifically and technically literate workforce.                             
                   Funds will be spent on research, development of a strategy and            
              materials.  The campaigns will be conducted with active                        
              participation of local TV stations, radio stations, newspaper and              
              Forum members.  The campaigns are directed specifically to the                 
              general public and the importance of being                                     
              scientifically/technically literate.
