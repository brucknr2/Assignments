Abstract    :
                   This project will explore the application of heterogeneous                
              intelligent software composed of expert systems and artificial                 
              neural networks to manufacturing process planning.  Process                    
              planning is an important component of the manufacturing life cycle             
              where product designs are translated to steps and processes for                
              manufacturing.  Process planning is critical to the subsequent                 
              quality of the product, and the unit cost during manufacturing.                
              Therefore, it is an important contributor to an organization's                 
              ability to compete through the cost to manufacture, utility and                
              performance of its products.                                                   
                   The project will focus on developing a complete understanding             
              of process planning and its opportunities for intelligent                      
              computing.  This includes the many manufacturing operations, how               
              each applies to each product design feature and the correct                    
              sequence of operations.  An appreciation for the best                          
              process/sequence combinations leading to efficiency during the                 
              manufacturing phase and cost effectiveness on the line is                      
              fundamental for a final project which applies intelligent computing            
              in an effective manner.
