Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This research is concerned with investigating how the brain                    
              recognizes objects in the environment using the somatosensory                  
              tactile system.  Results obtained will further our understanding of            
              how computations are carried out in complex, cortical information-             
              processing systems, and will contribute to the growing body of                 
              knowledge about how the brain is organized to process sensory                  
              information.  The techniques used are behavioral testing, computer-            
              assisted motion analysis and electrical recordings from single brain           
              cells in order to investigate how mammals acquire, process and use             
              sensory information from facial vibrissae.  Previous studies have              
              demonstrated that important similarities exist between this tactile            
              system and use of the fingertips by humans, when they are actively             
              touching textured surfaces.
