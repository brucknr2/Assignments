Abstract    :
              This is a renewal grant for theoretical study of electronic                    
              transport phenomena in disordered systems having strong electron-              
              electron interactions.  Effective field theoretic models will be               
              developed, and studied using perturbative techniques and the                   
              renormalization group.  Specifically, this research will center on             
              two problems in superconductivity and three problems involving                 
              metal-insulator and related problems in normal systems.  The issues            
              in superconductivity are the supression of conventional                        
              superconductivity by strong disorder and the possibility of exotic             
              superconductivity in two-dimensional electron systems.  The work in            
              normal conductors is aimed at enhancing current understanding of               
              zero temperature phase transitions in doped semiconductors.

              This ongoing research project will study transport of electric                 
              current in several types of materials.  The unifying theme is that             
              the interactions between the charge carriers is strong.  Such                  
              materials are potentially among the brightest opportunities for new            
              practical application, and are little understood at the present                
              time.  This project will investigate fundamental issues of this                
              class of materials which will form much of the intellectual                    
              infrastructure for their future application.
