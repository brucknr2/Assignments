Abstract    :
              Mr. Robert Rosenthal, Manager of NIST's Protocol Security Group,has            
              proposed to provide 1/2 professional person year effort of                     
              engineering and technical advice to NSF's Division of                          
              NetworkingResearch and Communications Infrastructure.  This effort             
              would be applied to areas relevant to NREN that include (but not               
              limited to) defac to and official standards and processes, network             
              and relevant host based security, naming and addressing, routing,              
              acceptable use policies and how they may be implemented via                    
              protocols, accelerating the privatization of commodity                         
              network services via well structured networks and protocol support,            
              and peering at inter network exchange points.  Mr. Rosenthal would             
              join two other highly respected and competent individuals who                  
              currently perform the same function as members of the NSF                      
              Engineering Group (NEG), which reports to Bob Aiken, the DNCRI NREN            
              program manager.
