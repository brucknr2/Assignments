Abstract    :
                   The object of the project is to develop multilayer composite              
              coatings on carbide tool inserts for high speed machining of steel             
              and cast iron.  Nonequilibrium processing using laser physical                 
              vapor deposition will be employed.  A multitarget, high vacuum                 
              chamber with facilities to maintain selective environment and in-              
              situ process the coatings has been designed and constructed.                   
              Titanium carbide will be deposited on tungsten carbide tool insert             
              to form and initial adherent coating.  Multilayer composite                    
              coatings will be developed.  Laser parameters, thickness and number            
              of the layers of the coatings will be optimized to achieve high                
              quality coatings.  The coatings will be characterized using modern             
              analytical techniques to determine second phase formation,                     
              interdiffusion, segregation, and epitaxial nature of the interface.            
              Mechanical properties of the coatings will be evaluated.  The                  
              coated tools will be tested in high speed machining to determine               
              the wear and failure mechanisms.                                               
                   The project should lead to the development of coatings for                
              cutting tools with improved wear resistance which should allow                 
              increased productivity in machining.
