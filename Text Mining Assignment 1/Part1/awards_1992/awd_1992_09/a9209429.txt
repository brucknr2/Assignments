Abstract    :
                   Three projects are planned that extend the theory of                      
              electron impact ionization developed by Briggs, Brauner and                    
              Klar; ionization plus excitation, extension of the BBK theory                  
              to lower energies using the distorted wave method and                          
              investigation of differential cross sections for heavier atoms                 
              with one or two valence electrons.
