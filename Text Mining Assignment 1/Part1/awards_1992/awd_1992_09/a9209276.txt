Abstract    :
                   Research in theoretical elementary particle physics will                  
              focus on investigations which involve extensive collaboration                  
              between theoretical and experimental physicists.  There will                   
              be a general analysis aimed at testing the consistency of our                  
              theory of the strong nuclear force and at accurately                           
              determining the structure of a nucleon in terms of quarks, and                 
              detailed analyses of a variety of individual elementary                        
              particle physics processes.  These investigations are very                     
              important to the interpretation of present experiments and the                 
              planning of future ones.
