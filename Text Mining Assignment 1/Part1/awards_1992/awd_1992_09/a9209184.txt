Abstract    :
              This research project focuses on parallel computation.  Its                    
              aim is to advance the basic understanding of parallel                          
              computers.  The primary goals are to develop new techniques to                 
              solve problems efficiently in parallel, to produce new                         
              parallel approximation algorithms, to determine why some                       
              problems do not parallelize well, and to address the parallel                  
              complexity of some fundamental open problems.  Problems from                   
              three general areas: algebra, geometry, and graph theory will                  
              be studied.
