Abstract    :
                   Studies of stream fish ecology emphasize the long-standing                
              view that local factors determine local diversity.  However, a                 
              growing body of evidence form studies of other groups of organisms             
              suggests that local diversity is strongly influenced by diversity              
              at broader spatial and temporal scales.  The local determinism                 
              hypothesis predicts that local communities are in equilibrium with             
              the local environment, and thus, are only as complex as local                  
              habitat. The regional enrichment hypothesis predicts increases in              
              local diversity with increases in regional diversity, regardless               
              of                                                                             
              habitat complexity, and local adjustments in niche breath and niche            
              overlap to accommodate the added diversity.  A three-year study of             
              local and regional influences on stream fish diversity in the                  
              southeastern U.S. is proposed to test predictions of the above                 
              hypotheses.  Fishes will by sampled, and data on habitat                       
              variability gathered, from small, upland streams in five                       
              southeastern drainage basins differing in diversity.  The effects              
              of differences in basin-scale diversity on local species-abundance             
              relationships and habitat utilization patterns will be analyzed to             
              determine how basin level diversity is accommodated locally.  The              
              goal of this research is demonstrate the degree to which diversity             
              in small local areas depends on processes operating outside of the             
              areas.  The results should have special relevance for biological               
              conservation efforts.
