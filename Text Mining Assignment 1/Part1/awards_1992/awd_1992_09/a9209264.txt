Abstract    :
              This award in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic                  
              Program provides continued support for research by Dr. Ayusman                 
              Sen of the Chemistry Department, Pennsylvania State University,                
              concerning the oxidation of carbon-hydrogen bonds.  Sen has                    
              found that unactivated C-H bonds are attacked selectively by                   
              Pt(II) complexes, whereas Pt(0) activates C-H bonds alpha to                   
              oxygen or nitrogen.  He proposes to study the mechanistic                      
              details of the system in order to characterize the C-H                         
              activation step, the structure and reactivity of the                           
              intermediate organometallic species, the types of cooxidants                   
              that could make the system catalytic, and the origins of the                   
              selectivity.                                                                   
              %%%                                                                            
              A variety of organic compounds, such as alkanes, ethers, and                   
              alcohols, can be oxidized in aqueous solution under mild                       
              conditions by platinum (II).  This potentially very useful                     
              reaction for organic synthesis is not well understood.  Sen                    
              will carry out a detailed investigation of how the reaction                    
              proceeds in order to discover how it can be made to react with                 
              specific carbon-hydrogen bonds in a system that contains many                  
              carbon-hydrogen bonds.  The results have utility in the                        
              chemical manufacturing industry, both for the production of                    
              large scale and specialty products.
