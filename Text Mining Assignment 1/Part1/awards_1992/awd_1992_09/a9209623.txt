                  Adrion          The State/Industry University Cooperative Research Center
              on Intelligent Information Retrieval was established at the University of
              Massachusetts in Amherst in 1992.  NSF in partnership with the State of
              Massachusetts and 18 other companies both large and small support the program. 
              This program addresses scientific issues that are key to the efficient access,
              management and control of information.  The core research program includes four
              thrust areas, 1) information retrieval, 2) natural language processing, 3) case
              based reasoning and 4) control architectures.  The Industrial Advisory Board
              which is composed of one representative from each of the member companies is
              actively participating in this program particularly in the area of medical
              information retrieval.  The Industrial Advisory Board also provides guidance
              and evaluation of the research program.  More than 15 papers have been accepted
              for publication for the research work that has been completed since the start
              of the Center.
