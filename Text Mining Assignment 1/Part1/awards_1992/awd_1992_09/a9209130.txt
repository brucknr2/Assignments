Abstract    :
                   The aim of this project is to develop new methods for                     
              recovering curves, spectra, signals and images from indirect,                  
              noisy observations.  This work is based on the discovery that the              
              minimax principle requires one to act as if the object to be                   
              recovered is sparse - mostly zero - when viewed in the                         
              appropriate transform domain, so that nonlinear methods derived                
              from the minimax principle can exploit this sparsity much better               
              than traditional linear methods.  The basic theory of recovering               
              sparse sequences in noise will be expanded and applications to                 
              specific scientific settings will be developed using the wavelet               
              transform, Fourier transform and wavelet-vaguelette                            
              decomposition.  Results are expected for tomography, inversion of              
              Abel transforms and time series spectral analysis; also                        
              foundational arguments for the white noise model will be                       
              constructed, with particular reference to nonlinearity.                        
                   When data are recorded for high dimensions, as for example                
              in the form of pictures or images, recovering an exact                         
              description or identifying the parameters of the process that                  
              produced the data can be exceedingly difficult.  This work will                
              consider some remarkable new mathematical and statistical                      
              techniques which should enable such a reconstruction efficiently               
              and with as much accuracy as the quality of the data permit.                   
              Both the mathematical theory and the practical implementation                  
              will be undertaken as part of this project.
