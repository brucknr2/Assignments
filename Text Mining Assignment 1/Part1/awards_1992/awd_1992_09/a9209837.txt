Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This is a one year cooperative study proposed by Dr. David                     
              Allara, the Pennsylvania State University, and Professor Yu-Tai                
              Tao, Institute of Chemistry, Academia Sinica supported by the AUT              
              (U.S.) - CCNAA (Taiwan) Cooperative Science Program.  This                     
              project proposes to study the polymer chain structures at                      
              polyethylene interface using new methods of infrared                           
              spectroscopy, x-ray excited photoelectrons, and ion mass                       
              spectrometry.  The approach is a new one using state of the art                
              techniques.  The scheme of crystalline polymer film formation has              
              important applications for adhesion and surface modification.                  
              Dr. Allara is a physical chemist and Dr. Tao of the Institute of               
              Chemistry, Academy of Sinica, Taiwan, has expertise in chemical                
              synthesis.  The collaboration is mutually beneficial and the                   
              results can advance our understanding of the structures and                    
              interactions of thin polymer interfaces.
