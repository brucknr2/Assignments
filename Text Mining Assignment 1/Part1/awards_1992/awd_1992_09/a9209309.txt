Abstract    :
              The purpose of the research to be performed on this RIA award is               
              to provide information on fundamental mechanisms that manifest                 
              during the brittle-to-ductile transition (BDT) process using a                 
              novel experimental technique.  The issues to be addressed are:                 
              (1) whether BDT is controlled by crack tip dislocation nucleation              
              or dislocation mobility; (2) what are the critical crack tip                   
              dislocation configurations that result in BDT; (3) what is the                 
              strain rate sensitivity of the BDT; and (4) what are the effects               
              of impurities on the BDT.
