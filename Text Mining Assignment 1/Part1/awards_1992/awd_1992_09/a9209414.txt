Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This award supports a U.S.-U.K. project development workshop in                
              biological oceanography.  The organizers are Gary Kleppel of the               
              Nova University Oceanographic Center, Dania, Florida and Keith                 
              Brander of the Fisheries Laboratory, Ministry of Agriculture,                  
              Fisheries and Food of the United Kingdom. Scientists from other                
              parts of the United Kingdom (Wales and Scotland) and Ireland will              
              also participate. The purpose of the workshop is to synthesize                 
              the current state of knowledge on environmental regulation of                  
              productivity in the Irish Sea, and to identify data gaps and                   
              research objectives for a future regional cooperative research                 
              effort.                                                                        
                                                                                             
              The Irish Sea is a shallow body of water bordered by Scotland,                 
              England, Wales, the Republic of Ireland, Northern Ireland, and                 
              the Island of Man.  Although it has been the site of many                      
              traditional biological investigations, questions involving the                 
              links between natural environmental variability and productivity               
              (including fish production) in the Irish Sea remain unanswered.                
              The workshop will focus on problems concerning the relationships               
              between organisms and their physical environments, pelagic food                
              webs, and the factors limiting larval fish survival.  While work               
              on the Irish Sea benefits local regional and scientific interests              
              in the British Isles, it also augments current research on these               
              same questions in the U.S. and in other countries.  The workshop               
              provides an opportunity for participants to plan a regional study              
              on the issues of immediate interest to the region and on the                   
              broader issue of global climate change and its impact on marine                
              food webs and production.
