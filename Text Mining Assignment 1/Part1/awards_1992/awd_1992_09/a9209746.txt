Abstract    :
              Global Climate Change often abbreviated as Global                              
              Change is burdened with complexity and                                         
              uncertainty.  To overcome this obstacle, substantial                           
              and increasing human resources are dedicated to                                
              the advancement of the understanding of Global                                 
              Change, and are expected to result in a                                        
              comparatively rapid increase in knowledge.  This,                              
              however, will take time.  While there is genuine and                           
              legitimate disagreement as to when to initiate the                             
              mitigative action and what kind of alternative                                 
              strategies (with no action being one of the                                    
              alternatives) have to be formulated and a basis for                            
              this comparative evaluation has to be established.                             
              In this respect, we propose a multivalued index                                
              called the Energy Production Index (EPI) that                                  
              accounts for physical (climatic, biological, etc.) and                         
              economic factors.  EPI replaces the traditionally                              
              used Global Warming Potential (GWP) which is far                               
              to simplistic and inadequate leaving out many                                  
              critical factors such as transition dynamics and                               
              global warming dynamics.  Methodologies based on                               
              systems approaches will be used to develop tools to                            
              evaluate EPI and therefore the impact of energy                                
              production policy on global change.  Suspected                                 
              global warming processes will be accounted for and                             
              their effect compared.  Computer-aided tools to be                             
              generated can potentially be used for policy                                   
              formulation, evaluation and negotiation processes.
