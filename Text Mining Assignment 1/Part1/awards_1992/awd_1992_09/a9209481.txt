                                         ABSTRACT                                            
                                                                                             
                                                                                             
                  This project, begun in 1987, is producing a multi-volume                  
              Etymological Dictionary and Thesaurus of Proto-Sino-Tibetan                    
              (PST), the ancestor language, spoken perhaps 6000 years ago, from              
              which Chinese and its hundreds of relatives in the Tibeto-Burman               
              (TB) family descend.  The organization of STEDT is by semantic                 
              fields, so as ultimately to constitute a thesaurus of the                      
              proto-lexicon.                                                                 
                   The Sino-Tibetan (ST)languages (typically monosyllabic and                
              tonal) are of unusual cultural importance and theoretical                      
              interest.  Lexical data, of uneven quality, is now available for               
              hundreds of TB languages and dialects.  This project has already               
              created a vast quality-controlled database of historically                     
              significant lexical material, incorporating some 200 published                 
              and unpublished sources (some solicited by questionnaire), now                 
              totalling over 130,000 records and occupying over 60 megabytes of              
              disk space.  Priority has been given to the profusion of new                   
              information furnished by Chinese and Indian linguists.  To this                
              Lexical Database is joined an Etymological Database, where all                 
              etymologies previously proposed for any taxonomic level of ST or               
              its subgroups are collatable for analysis and evaluation.  Yet                 
              most of the reconstructed roots in this database are quite new,                
              and have only been attainable because of the massive amount of                 
              data brought together by this project.  The first semantic area                
              to be covered now comprises close to 1000 roots and root                       
              variants, to be included in the first volume of STEDT, Bodypart                
              Nomenclature, which will come to roughly one thousand pages.                   
              Production of subsequent volumes will proceed at an accelerated                
              rate during the new grant period.                                              
                   The STEDT will constitute the most comprehensive and                      
              accurate documentation of the Sino-Tibetan language family ever                
              produced, and will be an important resource for historical                     
              linguistic research and theories of language change in general.
