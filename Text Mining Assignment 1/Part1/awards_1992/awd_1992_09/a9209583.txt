Abstract    :
                   This research will create an entirely new approach to                     
              application prototyping process modification and error recovery in             
              manufacturing.  Human supervisors will communicate with robots and             
              other automated equipment like they might direct human                         
              subordinates-by pointing at locations while giving directives about            
              objects and actions.  This point-and-direct approach to                        
              manufacturing will allow new products to be introduced quickly and             
              will lead to continuous manufacturing improvement.  Changes and                
              corrections will be made in nearly real-time.  The development of              
              a technology for remotely designating object orientation and                   
              position anywhere in an unstructured three-dimensional workspace               
              is critical in realizing point-and-direct strategic control in                 
              manufacturing.                                                                 
                   This research in point-and-direct manufacturing will lead to              
              the development of a novel manufacturing control technology where              
              humans perform the task conception and scene interpretation                    
              functions for which they are well suited while machines perform the            
              task execution function at which machines excel.  Both small                   
              flexible enterprises, and large multiple-cell manufacturers will               
              be able to use this control strategy to employ robots and other                
              intelligent machines with greater ease.
