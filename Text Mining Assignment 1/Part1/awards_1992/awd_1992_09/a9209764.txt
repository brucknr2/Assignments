Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Interneuronal communication, in the form of synaptic transmission,             
              may be a process that is fundamental to memory.  Persistent                    
              modifications of synaptic transmission that are induced by neuronal            
              activation are emphasized in certain neurobiological models of                 
              memory.  It is very likely that such use-induced, long-lasting                 
              modifications involve both an enhancement (potentiation) or                    
              reduction (depression) of synaptic transmission.  Dr. Dahl will                
              investigate a possible physiological basis for the induction of                
              synaptic potentiation or depression.  He will be testing two                   
              specific hypotheses in the CA1 region of the hippocampus:  1)                  
              postsynaptic depolarization coupled with neuronal activation may               
              be a necessary condition for potentiation of synaptic transmission,            
              and 2) postsynaptic hyperpolarization couple with neuronal                     
              activation may be necessary for the induction of depression.  The              
              results of this work may provide a basis for study of intraneuronal            
              processes that are voltage-dependent, and may underlie synaptic                
              potentiation and/or depression.  Furthermore, the results may be               
              generally applicable to cortical information processing.***//
