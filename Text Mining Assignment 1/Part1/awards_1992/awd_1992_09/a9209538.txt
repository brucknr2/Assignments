Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The ability to visually recognize complex objects is dependent upon            
              structures within the central nervous system which are responsible             
              for perceiving the objects and for processing the information                  
              received. One important type of visual recognition which is                    
              critical for any species is the ability of individuals of that                 
              species to distinguish members of different species from those of              
              their own  species, or conspecifics; this type of discrimination               
              is important to recognize potential predators as well as potential             
              mates. In this award to Dr. Toru Shimizu, visual recognition will              
              be studied in two avian species. Anatomical connections between                
              various parts of the higher visual areas of the central nervous                
              system will be studied using tracer techniques. Discrimination                 
              based on differentiating between members of the same or different              
              species, and between the two genders will be studied with the use              
              of video images. The importance of different regions of the higher             
              visual areas of the brain will be determined by studying the                   
              effects of selective ablation on performance in the discrimination             
              paradigm. This research contributes knowledge about how the brain              
              recognizes complex visual objects and how this visual information              
              is processed to obtain meaningful responses.
