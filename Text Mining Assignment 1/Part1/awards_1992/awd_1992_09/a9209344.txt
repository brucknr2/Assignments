Abstract    :
                   Quality assurance is a field in which statistical techniques              
              and problem-solving methods are used in order to achieve and                   
              improve quality.  In this project, important topics in quality                 
              assurance will be investigated in the context of Bayesian                      
              statistics and decision analysis.  The first topic to be                       
              addressed is Statistical Process Control.  Control charts based                
              on posterior distributions and credibility intervals for quality               
              indexes will be defined and analyzed.  The second topic to be                  
              explored is the motivation underlying assessments of probability               
              distributions traditionally adopted in quality assurance.  These               
              models will be derived by analyzing the physics behind the                     
              manufacturing systems.  Often, it is necessary to use diagnostic               
              tests in order to decide whether or not items coming from a                    
              production line are conforming to requirements.  The third topic               
              to be studied is the calibration of diagnostic tests based on                  
              censored data.                                                                 
                   Quality is a key factor leading to success, growth and                    
              enhanced competitive position.  There is always a substantial                  
              return on investment from any effective program designed to                    
              improve quality.  These programs result in increased market                    
              penetration, higher productivity and lower overall costs of                    
              manufacturing and services.
