Abstract    :
              The cycle of dissolved organic matter in riverine saltmarsh                    
              estuaries is remarkably non-conservative.  In the Parker River -               
              Plum Island Sound estuary of northern Massachusetts there are                  
              major inputs of DOC from rivers and from the sea, but there are                
              also large inputs from fresh and saline tidal marshes and from                 
              estuarine phytoplankton.  Through the use of stable isotope                    
              tracers we can follow the production and consumption of DOC from               
              these different sources.  The emerging view is that the large                  
              background of terrestrial and oceanic DOC is relatively refractory             
              while fresh DOC from algae and marshes is largely responsible for              
              the high rates of bacterial activity in these systems.  The algae              
              and marshes at times produce large quantities of DOC that are not              
              immediately consumed by bacteria and are thus available for                    
              transport with the tides.  In this proposal, the investigators                 
              couple the stable isotope approach with ecosystem modeling to                  
              calculate the ecosystem level fluxes of DOC from these different               
              sources and to estimate the microbial consumption and export of                
              dissolved organic matter from each source.
