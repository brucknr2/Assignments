Abstract    :
              The objectives of the proposed research are to                                 
              developed an optimum design approach for                                       
              permanent magnet brushless dc machines.  Issues                                
              such as geometric complexities, configuration,                                 
              armature reaction effects and nonlinear                                        
              characteristics of the ferromagnetic materials will                            
              be addressed in the development of the modeling                                
              and optimum design procedures.  The approach will                              
              be a nonlinear programming approach based on                                   
              constrained optimization techniques.  It is                                    
              anticipated that the magnetic field will be solved by                          
              use of finite-element techniques, with an initial low                          
              degree of discretization meshes.  The degree of                                
              discretization meshes will be increased with                                   
              convergence of the optimum solution, for high                                  
              accuracy and computing speed. Once an algorithm                                
              is developed to obtain the optimum design                                      
              parameters, the performance of the system will be                              
              evaluated and compared with conventional design                                
              techniques.  Feasibility and efficiency will be taken                          
              into consideration throughout the research project.
