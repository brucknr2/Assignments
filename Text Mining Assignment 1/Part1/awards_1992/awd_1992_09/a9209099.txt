Abstract    :
                   Dr. Julian Humphries is a fish biologist and museum curator               
              at Cornell University.  He has developed a database software                   
              system called "MUSE" for managing museum collection data with                  
              microcomputers, and more than twenty natural history collections               
              (mostly vertebrate) around the world have adopted the system.                  
              Dr. Humphries proposes to continue development of the software                 
              system by adapting it to new hardware platforms (Macintosh and                 
              UNIX machines), and establishing inter-site connections using                  
              Internet.  Dr. Humphries also plans three workshops to introduce               
              newcomer museums to collection computerization, to train other                 
              curators and collection managers in the use of MUSE, and to                    
              develop community-wide data standards for collection databases.                
                   The MUSE software system has had great impact on the                      
              community of vertebrate biologists by making data readily                      
              available from museum collections.  Access to these data are                   
              having important impact on research in evolution, biological                   
              diversity and global climate change, and the community's reliance              
              on these data will expand and accelerate.  The proposed extension              
              of the MUSE Project will benefit the research community in                     
              tangible, immediate ways.
