Abstract    :
                   Electronic imaging is an emerging technology area that will               
              promote acquisition, transmission, storage, and display of                     
              information through visual means.  Advances in this technological              
              area will lead to important new systems for factory automation                 
              using robots, medical diagnostics, office automation, and                      
              defense.  The State/Industry/University Cooperative Research                   
              Center for Electronic Imaging at the University of Rochester in                
              collaboration with the Rochester Institute of Technology will                  
              address the following major research topics: (1) digital image                 
              processing, (2) image sequence processing, (3) digital                         
              compression, and (4) color reproduction in different media.  The               
              initial industrial partnership includes seven companies.  The                  
              technology transfer will occur through collaborative research                  
              with company personnel, and industrial residentship in the                     
              Center.  The Center will participate in the new program of                     
              undergraduate education under the Rochester Education Demands                  
              Involvement Initiative by implementing special projects, and                   
              developing new courses that relate to electronic imaging.
