Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              ABSTRACT                                                                       
                                                                                             
              This project develops a research program, the Sub-Symbolic                     
              Paradigm (SSP), which  exploits connectionist computation as a                 
              bridge between numerical neural computation and  symbolic mental               
              computation, and forges an integration in which the latter is an               
              approximate higher-level description of the former.                            
                                                                                             
              While much of connectionist research has addressed problems and                
              data from cognitive  psychology, SSP has focused on complementary              
              data and problems in higher cognition  that are centrally located              
              in linguistics and the foundations of cognitive science.  SSP has              
              already made significant progress, including (a) mathematical                  
              techniques for representing  symbolic structures as lower-level                
              distributed patterns of activity and for (b) performing                        
              massively parallel structure-sensitive processing on such                      
              representations; (c) the analysis  of connectionist computation                
              as maximizing Harmony, a well-formedness measure on                            
              representations; (d) contributions to theoretical linguistics in               
              the areas of syntax/semantics  and phonology that rely on using                
              Harmony to measure the well-formedness of linguistic  structures;              
              and (e) contributions to the foundations of cognitive science                  
              deriving from the  interpretation of the preceding results.                    
                                                                                             
              The new research to be supported by the present grant will build               
              on (d), expanding the  theory of grammar as a well-formedness                  
              optimizing system, and on (e), systematically  developing a                    
              typology of strategies for connectionist-grounded explanations of              
              the striking  productivity of human higher cognition.                          
                                                                                             
              SSP is contributing to the development of a new methodology for                
              cognitive science which  is more than just the sum of those of                 
              its sister disciplines, a methodology capable of  yielding                     
              results which are beyond the reach of all the other disciplines                
              proceeding  individually.  By integrating linguistic,                          
              philosophical, and mathematical analysis, computer  simulation,                
              and techniques from both discrete and continuous computation,                  
              this new  methodology can develop more powerful connectionist                  
              systems, innovative symbolic  formalisms, and general cognitive                
              principles that constitute real progress towards the  unification              
              of connectionist and symbolic theories of brain and mind.
