Abstract    :
              The objective of this project is to provide an experimental                    
              basis for the various analytical/numerical solution techniques                 
              which have been developed for radiation heat transfer in                       
              participating media. A heated enclosure filled with a fibrous                  
              materials as the participating medium will be the test                         
              article. Radiation issuing through a slit will be measured                     
              with a reflective optical system designed to minimize and                      
              account for thermal noise. The experimental results will be                    
              compared to numerical results using the discrete ordinate                      
              method. Results with and without imbedded thermal sensors will                 
              be obtained.
