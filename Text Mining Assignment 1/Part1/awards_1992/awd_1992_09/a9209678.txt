Abstract    :
                   The goal of this project is the development and application               
              of topological and analytical methods useful for the study of                  
              existence, multiplicity, and stability of solutions of nonlinear               
              nonautonomous differential equations.  The fact that the                       
              equations are forced or have temporal dependence complicates them              
              considerably.                                                                  
                   Differential equations with forcing model a wide variety of               
              phenomena that occurs in everyday life.  Problems with                         
              nonlinearities near resonance are very complicated and require                 
              very sophisticated mathematics to give qualitative information.
