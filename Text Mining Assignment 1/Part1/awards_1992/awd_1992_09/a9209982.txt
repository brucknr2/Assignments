Abstract    :
                   The objective of this research is to determine the effect of              
              the structure of a fiber preform on its conformability to certain              
              part shapes -- e.g., corners, curves.  The use of fiber preforms               
              can significantly open up the medium to high volume composite                  
              markets due to its potential to produce cost-effective yet                     
              structurally sound, near net shape parts.  However, complex part               
              shapes can result in regions where the alignment of fibers  is not             
              in the direction of maximum loading.  In addition, fiber movement              
              can result in regions of low fiber volume fraction leading to weak             
              spots.  Both of these variations tend to occur in areas where                  
              stress concentrations are also a concern, resulting in failures                
              below projected loading capacity.  The project will investigate                
              several methods of measuring preform deformation (e.g., tensile,               
              shear, and bending behavior) -- including the use of optical and               
              image analysis techniques, tracer fibers, and various load                     
              configurations simulating processing conditions.  It is expected               
              that this preliminary work will lead to a more detailed study                  
              resulting in the quantification of the deformation response of                 
              aligned, biaxial, and random fiber mats.  By understanding the                 
              deformation behavior of different fiber mat geometries, the                    
              response of various preform architectures to processing conditions             
              can be predicted and thus optimized to fit the desired part shape.             
                   A detailed understanding of the behavior of fiber mats is                 
              essential to the widespread use of composite materials in the "mass            
              market" application areas, particularly in the automotive industry.
