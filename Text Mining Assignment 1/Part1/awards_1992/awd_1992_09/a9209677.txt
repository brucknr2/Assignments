Abstract    :
              This proposal addresses a fundamental problem limiting progress                
              in                                                                             
              microbial ecology--the poor correlation between cultivated and                 
              naturally occurring microorganisms.  This paradox has been                     
              revealed                                                                       
              using small-subunit ribosomal RNA (SSU rRNA) sequences to                      
              characterize a model hot spring cyanobacterial mat community.                  
              Because the isolates come mainly from the model community, the                 
              model is particularly well-suited for investigating the basis for              
                                                                                             
              this discrepancy.  rRNA-based hybridization probe studies of                   
              cultivated and uncultivated phototrophic microorganisms of the                 
              mat                                                                            
              provide a more focused view of the boundaries of the model                     
              community, and permit formulation of several hypotheses that are               
                                                                                             
              likely to explain the failure to detect SSU rRNAs of cultivated                
              species.  Hypotheses are based on how trophic structure affects                
              abundance and how culture procedures select for microorganisms                 
              not                                                                            
              adapted hypotheses, (a) a more streamlined search for SSU rRNAs                
              of                                                                             
              natural community members, (b) a comprehensive probe study to                  
              determine the distributions and numeric relevance of all                       
              cultivated                                                                     
              and uncultivated species, and (c) the cultivation of more                      
              relevant                                                                       
              species using more ecologically sound approaches will be                       
              undertaken.  The results are essential for future studies as well              
                                                                                             
              as parallel studies of the mat as a model for ancient microbial                
              communities.
