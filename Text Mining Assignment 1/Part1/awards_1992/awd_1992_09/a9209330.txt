Abstract    :
                   The principal investigators will continue their research in               
              the cross disciplinary area of topology and differential                       
              geometry. In particular they will study topological aspects of                 
              Monge-Ampere foliations, harmonic representatives of homotopy                  
              classes of maps between spheres, and Einstein metrics on four                  
              manifolds. The award will support travel for the principal                     
              investigators, graduate students, and visitors to Tulane                       
              University.                                                                    
                   This award will support research in the general area of                   
              differential geometry and global analysis. Differential geometry               
              is the study of the relationship between the geometry of a space               
              and analytic concepts defined on the space. Global analysis is                 
              the study of the overall geometric and topological properties of               
              a space by piecing together local information. Applications of                 
              these areas of mathematics in other sciences include the                       
              structure of complicated molecules, liquid-gas boundaries, and                 
              the large scale structure of the universe.
