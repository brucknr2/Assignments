Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This project is a Research Planning Grant in the Research                      
              Opportunities for Women program at the National Science                        
              Foundation.  The relatively small amount of funds will allow a                 
              researcher from Rice University to do a pilot project in a Basque              
              province of Spain.  The research will study how members of a                   
              cooperative community, which seeks a fully industrialized life                 
              style intermediate between socialist and capitalism, interpret                 
              new developments in the technology affecting pregnancy and birth.              
              The biomedical technologies are usually based on a model of                    
              gender relations with male physicians dominant over female                     
              patients, yet the ideology of the cooperative is that of                       
              egalitarianism.  The planning grant will allow the PI to visit                 
              the field site, establish contacts, and do preliminary                         
              interviewing and participant observation to allow her to prepare               
              a full-scale research proposal next year.                                      
                                                                                             
              This research is important because such small pilot projects                   
              allow female researchers to prepare more competitive proposals                 
              and gain valuable research experience.
