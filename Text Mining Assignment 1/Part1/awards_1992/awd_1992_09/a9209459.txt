Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The normal formation of the cerebral cortex is a prerequisite for              
              attaining higher cognitive, motor and sensory function.  This study            
              will examine some basic issues of cortical development:  intrinsic             
              and extrinsic factors regulating either differentiation of neurons             
              or connectivity allowing the development of functionally distinct              
              areas of cerebral cortex in mammals.  In particular, this proposal             
              will be focusing on the development of one part of the limbic                  
              system, the perirhinal cortex.  In recent transplantation studies,             
              results have shown there is an early specification of neurons to               
              express a limbic molecular phenotype, the limbic-system-associated             
              membrane protein, LAMP (Barbe and Levitt, 1991; Appendix I).                   
              Earlier experiments showed that this molecule may play a role in               
              circuit formation in vitro (Keller et al., 1989).  Most recently,              
              results suggested that there is a correlation between the early                
              commitment of the cortex to this molecular phenotype and the                   
              formation of specific thalamocortical connections (Barbe and                   
              Levitt, submitted; Appendix II).  These experiments have led to                
              additional issues for exploration of cortical commitment and                   
              connectivity.  Using a tissue transplantation paradigm, I will be              
              testing two aspects of the development of the cortex into                      
              functional areal arrays:  1) The commitment of cortical neurons to             
              a functional areal phenotype is linked to the cell cycle.  2) The              
              connections induced between limbic thalamic afferents and LAMP-                
              positive cortical transplants are maintained permanently.                      
                                                                                             
              The long term goals of my laboratory, some of which are addressed              
              in this proposal, are to better understand the molecular factors               
              that modulate the assembly of functional neuronal circuits, both               
              during development and after injury of the mammalian central                   
              nervous system.
