Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This award to Dr. A. Georgopoulos will investigate the coordination            
              of movements and forces when the arm is steered in space. Human                
              subjects will operate a handle that can be moved in space, or can              
              locked in place, so that it becomes an isometric force device.                 
              Perturbations of the movement will be delivered using two torque               
              motors. The experiment wuill determine how the three-dimensional               
              motor trajectory is steered on-line when such perturbations are                
              applied. This on-line steering of the motor trajectory is embedded             
              in cetain organizational principles; for example, the slowing of               
              the speed when the trajectory is curved and the segmentation of the            
              trajectory in planes. The research will elucidate the interactions             
              between these principles and the steering of the trajectory in the             
              presence of perturbations. This work will contribute basic                     
              knowledge to understanding human motor function.
