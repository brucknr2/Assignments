Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This project supports the dissertation research of a cultural                  
              anthropologist studying the changing definition of womens' social              
              and psychological problems in Japan. The changes are from a                    
              traditional physical-medical model to one including mental health              
              therapy, specifically dealing with feminist issues.  Ethnographic              
              methods of participant observation and in-depth interviews will                
              be used in three locations, a government-funded comprehensive                  
              mental health care center, a social casework department of a                   
              hospital, and the Tokyo feminist therapy center.  The student                  
              will examine how these therapeutic practices provoke women to                  
              redefine stresses from marital, child-rearing, and work-related                
              issues as social and political problems, rather then as medical                
              pathologies.                                                                   
                                                                                             
              This research is important because the insight it will provide                 
              about the changing social and psychological issues confronting                 
              Japanese women will help us understand why this important society              
              reacts as it does to modern events.
