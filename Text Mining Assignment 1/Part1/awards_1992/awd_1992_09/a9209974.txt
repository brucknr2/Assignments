Abstract    :
              The purpose of this research is to develop a realistic time-                   
              dependent mechanical model of collagenous chains in ligaments,                 
              based on the measured mechanical response of a larger segment of               
              a ligament, that can be used to develop global models for many                 
              different ligament morphologies.  The mechanical behavior of the               
              collagenous chain will be described by nonlinear viscoelastic                  
              models, and a computer program, that incorporates these material               
              models and global ligament geometry, will be written to predict                
              overall ligament behavior.  This tool can be used to develop                   
              synthetic polymers that mimic ligaments, thereby contributing to               
              the field of biomimetrics.
