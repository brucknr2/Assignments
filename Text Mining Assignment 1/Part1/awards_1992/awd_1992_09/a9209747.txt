Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Experimental and computational studies of the effects of                       
              natural gas composition variables on autoignition delay times                  
              will be carried out under simulated diesel engine conditions                   
              in a constant-volume combustion vessel.  Onset of heat release                 
              and flame lumino-sity will be measured for experimental                        
              determination of these delay times.  In addition, the HCT                      
              program (an existing one-dimensional hydrodynamic, chemical,                   
              and thermal computer code) will be used to study the                           
              theoretical dependence of this delay time on natural gas                       
              composition.  Model predictions will be checked against the                    
              experimental results.  Finally, a Cooperative Fuel Research                    
              (CFR) single-cylinder Diesel engine will be modified to burn                   
              compressed natural gas (CNG) and efficacy of these                             
              modifications will be studied.                                                 
                                                                                             
              Natural gas is an attractive alternative fuel to diesel fuel                   
              since it has a low emissions potential and is readily                          
              available.  However, under compression ignition conditions,                    
              natural gas has poor ignition characteristics relative to                      
              diesel fuel.  Better understanding of the ignition                             
              characteristics of natural gas and their dependence on gas                     
              composition (which is somewhat variable) are needed to                         
              facilitate the use of this fuel in compression ignition                        
              engines.
