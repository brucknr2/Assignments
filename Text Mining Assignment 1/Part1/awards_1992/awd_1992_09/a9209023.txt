Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Artificial neural networks (ANN's) are a rich and interesting class            
              of nonlinear models developed recently by cognitive scientists.                
              Although inspired by certain features of the neural architecture               
              of the brain, these models have considerable potential for use in              
              econometrics and economics because of their simplicity and great               
              flexibility.  Specifically, ANN models show promise as the basis               
              for nonparmetric estimation and for specification testing because              
              of their ability to approximate arbitrary elements of general                  
              function spaces to arbitrary accuracy.  Under previous NSF grants,             
              this project focused on establishing the mathematical and                      
              statistical foundations necessary for using ANN models in                      
              nonparametric estimation and specification testing.  The research              
              proposed in this accomplishment based renewal is to continue                   
              development of these foundations, to establish properties of ANN-              
              based nonparametric estimators, and to apply the resulting theory              
              to construct model specification tests.                                        
                                                                                             
              The areas in which mathematical and statistical theory will be                 
              pursued are two.  The first area is the establishment of degree of             
              approximation results for ANN models in Sobolev spaces.  The second            
              area is to obtain central limit theorems and invariance principles             
              for random elements constructed as partial sums of a dependent                 
              process (specifically, a mixingale process) in a Hilbert space.                
              The application areas make direct use of the proposed theoretical              
              results to model learning by economic agents.
