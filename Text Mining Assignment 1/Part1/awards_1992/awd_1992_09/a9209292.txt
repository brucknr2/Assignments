Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The embryonic brain is rich in acidic, sugar containing lipid                  
              molecules, sialoglycosphingolipids, or gangliosides.  Formation of             
              axonal and dendritic processes in the developing neuron requires               
              delivery of plasma membrane elements containing gangliosides of a              
              special higher molecular type.  It is not known how trafficking of             
              plasma membrane gangliosides takes place during the crucial initial            
              post-mitotic developmental period of the neuron when processes are             
              being elaborated.  This issue will be investigated using a                     
              convenient system of early chick telencephalic neurons cultured                
              under defined conditions in which synchronous outgrowth of neurites            
              are induced by epidermal growth factor, EGF.  The mechanisms                   
              involved in the modification of gangliosides contained in the                  
              membranes of coated vesicles that are taken up into the neuron                 
              following EGF stimulation will be studied.  The hypothesis that                
              ecto-sialotransferase activity is involved in alteration of the                
              ganglioside, GD3, in such a way as to provide matrix attachment and            
              neurite extension capability to the plasma membrane will be                    
              investigated.  These studies promise to provide fundamental                    
              information on ganglioside biosynthesis and function in brain                  
              development.
