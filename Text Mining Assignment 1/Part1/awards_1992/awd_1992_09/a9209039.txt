Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This research is to address the well known problems of social                  
              choice in environments more realistic than those normally                      
              considered.  In particular, the researcher will alter the                      
              requirements of universal domain, binary-ness, and transitivity                
              commonly assumed in work on social choice.  These requirements are             
              among the most basic for researchers working within the general                
              framework established by Kenneth Arrow in 1951.                                
                                                                                             
              This study will adopt choice axioms shaped by the exigencies for               
              real world computation and develop algorithms generating a member              
              of the set of best outcomes to allow for more latitude in the                  
              choice of a computational procedure.  This is because society may              
              wish to sacrifice some computational efficiency to open the door               
              to a social choice rule that has more desirable ethical properties             
              than a more efficient algorithm would permit.                                  
                                                                                             
              The goal is to examine the possibility of defining an efficient,               
              nonbinary, social choice correspondence that can be used to settle             
              the kinds of distributional welfare questions that typically                   
              confronted economists.  This important study represents a move                 
              toward greater realism in the basic models, and permits a much                 
              better fit between social choice theory and standard economic                  
              models.
