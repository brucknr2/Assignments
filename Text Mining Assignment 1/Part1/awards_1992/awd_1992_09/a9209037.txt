Abstract    :
              With National Science Foundation support, Dr. Michael Blakey and               
              assistants will curate the W. Montague Cobb Human Skeletal                     
              Collection. These materials were collected by Dr. Cobb in the                  
              course of his many years of medical school work and are currently              
              stored at Howard University in conditions which render the                     
              majority virtually inaccessible for research purposes. The                     
              collection consists of 737 skeletons and 982 records on these and              
              other cadavers. What makes these collections particularly                      
              valuable are the associated records because this gives                         
              researchers a "known" base against which to develop analytical                 
              methods and to the study effects of processes such as aging and                
              diet on the skeletal system.                                                   
                                                                                             
              Dr. Blakey plans to renovate and expand his present laboratory                 
              facility for collection storage, research and related laboratory               
              courses. Specimens will be relocated to the new laboratory                     
              facility and stored in adequate cabinets. A detailed and complete              
              inventory of skeletal specimens and elements will then be made.                
              The computer index will be expanded and upgraded and the                       
              availability of the collection be made known through publication.              
                                                                                             
              This project is important for several reasons. There are very few              
              large and well documented skeletal collections in the United                   
              States - far too few given present research needs. This project                
              will add to the list a third which will be available for study.                
              It will also serve to halt the progressive deterioration which                 
              the materials are undergoing.
