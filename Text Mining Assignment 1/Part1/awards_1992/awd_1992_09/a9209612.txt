Abstract    :
                   As biomedical technology has progressed, it has become                    
              increasingly important to develop materials for internal use in                
              the body, either as prostheses or as drug delivery devices, or as              
              interfaces with body solutions like blood.  The objective of the               
              State/Industry/University Cooperative Research Center for the                  
              Enhancement of the Biology/Biomaterials Interfaces at the                      
              University of Texas at San Antonio is to perform studies                       
              concerning the mechanisms which are involved in cellular response              
              to biomaterials as well as to design and develop new materials                 
              and prototype devices.  The major research topics include: (1)                 
              response of cells to hydrostatic pressure and materials, (2)                   
              bioresorption of biodegradable materials, (3) cardiac prostheses               
              calcification and colonization, (4) bacterial biofilm formation,               
              (5) drug delivery from oxide forming metals, (6) electrochemical               
              integrity of implants, and (7) tissue adaptation to materials.                 
              The research will be carried out in collaboration with a number                
              other institutions in the area.  Twenty large, medium and small                
              companies will be the initial members of the industrial                        
              partnership.  Technology transfer will occur through information               
              exchange, and test and evaluation performed by the companies.
