Abstract    :
              The goal of this research is to develop more reliable,                         
              experimentally-based constant-rate-of-strain (CRS) test analysis               
              techniques, particularly at fast strain rates. A new computer                  
              automated CRS consolidation apparatus will be used to conduct                  
              one-dimensional (1-D) consolidation tests on a resedimented clay.              
              The proposal has the following objectives: 1. develop computer                 
              automated CRS; 2. conduct CRS tests at various strain rates and                
              characterize the excess pore pressure distribution; 3. compare                 
              these results to those from other 1-D consolidation tests; 4.                  
              assess the CRS test's suitability for rapidly determining                      
              hydraulic conductivity; 5. incorporate the results into a unified              
              data base of time-dependent cohesive behavior.
