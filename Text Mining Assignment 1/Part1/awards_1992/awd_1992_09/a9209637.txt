Abstract    :
              This Career Advancement Award will enable Dr. Jeanette Adams to                
              broaden her research program. She will  work with an expert in                 
              theoretical studies to learn the approaches of ab initio and                   
              molecular mechanics calculations. She will also work with a                    
              leading practitioner in phase space calculations. Dr. Adams has                
              developed a productive program in mass spectroscopy. The new                   
              directions she will undertake will enable her to apply                         
              theortical methods to the interpretation of mass spectroscopic                 
              processes. These methods will complement the experimental                      
              techniques she has developed.

              This proposal builds a theoretical component into a strong                     
              experimental program in the technique of mass spectroscopy. It                 
              will help to develop new approaches to a powerful analytical                   
              technique with applications to the understanding of biological                 
              systems and metabolism
