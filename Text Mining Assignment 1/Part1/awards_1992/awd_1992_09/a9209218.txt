Abstract    :
              The synthesis and chemical reactivity of a variety of                          
              fluorinated reactive intermediates and related species will be                 
              investigated.  Among the intermediates to be characterized                     
              spectroscopically are triplet halocarbenes and                                 
              difluorovinylidene.  In addition, the thermal and photochemical                
              reactivity of fluorinated cumulones, difluorocyclopropenone,                   
              difluoroacetylene, and fluoropropynoyl fluoride, will be                       
              studied.  In the case of the fluorinated cumulenones, as well                  
              as partially fluorinated fused cyclobutenes, semi-fluorinated                  
              polymers will be synthesized and characterized with respect to                 
              conductivity and selected physical properties.  In an attempt                  
              to define new methods for carbene production, photolysis of                    
              cyclic alkene derived ozonides will be investigated.                           
              %%%                                                                            
              This grant from the Organic Dynamics Program supports the                      
              continuing investigation of reactive fluorinated compounds by                  
              Professor W. P. Dailey at the University of Pennsylvania.  A                   
              major goal of the research will be to generate, detect, and                    
              follow the subsequent reactions of highly reactive                             
              intermediates called carbenes which only exist at room                         
              temperature for a fraction of a second.  Special spectroscopic                 
              techniques are required to identify these reactive carbenes,                   
              which are important since they control the rate and type of                    
              products formed in a variety of chemical transformations.  A                   
              secondary goal of the project will be to synthesize and                        
              characterize polymeric materials with fluorine groups attached.                
              Such materials are of particular importance in fabricating                     
              surfaces with low surface tension capable of repelling water.
