Abstract    :
                   The PI plans to address the fundamental physical processes                
              that affect the behavior of semi-volatile organic compounds (SOCS)             
              in the troposphere.  Methods will be developed to collect particle             
              samples suitable for surface area analysis.  Specific surface areas            
              of urban and, for the first time, rural aerosols will be                       
              determined.  The results will be used to assess whether 10 urban               
              and rural particles differ significantly in specific surface area;             
              2) published estimates of specific surface area are reasonable; and            
              3) the current use of estimated surface areas in deposition                    
              modeling is appropriate.  Concentrations of n-alkanes and                      
              polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons will also be measured to                      
              investigate, in a preliminary fashion, the effect of particle                  
              surface area on the phase distribution of SOC's
