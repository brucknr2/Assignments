Abstract    :
              This research program addresses the problem of anomaly detection               
              and identification in solid mechanics.  There are two objectives in this       
              proposal.  The first is to develop robust operational procedure for            
              detecting mechanical anomalies in solids based on a continuous                 
              monitoring of surface strain measurements.  The second is to                   
              develop a method of identifying the characteristics of the anomaly             
              for the special case of a single growing crack or a system of                  
              microcracks.  These objectives can be achieved by developing and               
              using a new concept of signatures and testing the procedures using             
              numerical experiments.  The concept of signatures is related to the            
              idea of path-independent integrals but are based on a discrete                 
              number of measurement points and hence are a-priori aimed at                   
              experimental implementations.  The numerical experiments will use              
              the Boundary Element Method (BEM).  A technology of                            
              anomaly detection and identification would have various                        
              applications.  For example, critical structures approaching their              
              design service life may adopt this technology in order to have an              
              early precursor of possible failure.  This technology would also               
              be an important ingredient in the development of intelligent                   
              structures where an efficient self-monitoring system is                        
              valuable.
