Abstract    :
              The second generation of interprocessor communication networks for             
              multicomputers, the wormhole-routed network, is currently in                   
              production.  Initial experience indicates that long communication              
              paths are no longer a problem with these machines.  However,                   
              resources such as network channels are reserved for communication,             
              and the resulting contention can degrade performance.  Our tests               
              on a production machine indicate that the problem becomes more                 
              severe as the number of nodes increases.  We are interested in the             
              effect of this contention on the programmer.  Clearly, the old                 
              technique of mapping problems onto multicomputers using distance               
              as a metric no longer applies.  The research is on the development             
              of new metrics that consider contention.  We propose a metric which            
              has been shown to be effective for static mapping of homogeneous               
              tasks.  We are investigating an improved metric which can handle               
              inhomogeneous tasks.  Our ultimate goal is a metric which can be               
              useful for both static and dynamic mappings.  In order to handle               
              the latter case, a metric must be simple enough to be calculated,              
              or recalculated, quickly.  Our metric fits that requirement.  We               
              also develop load balancing techniques using our metric for                    
              computational physics problems.  Applying our techniques to real               
              problems on real machines ensure that our research is useful to the            
              computing community.
