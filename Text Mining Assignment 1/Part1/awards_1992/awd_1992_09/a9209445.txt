Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              GABA (gamma aminobutyric acid) functions as an inhibitory                      
              neurotransmitter in the central nervous system of many animals.                
              GABA binds to a specific cell membrane protein receptor to control             
              the activity of the neuron.  The GABA-A type receptor regulates a              
              chloride ion channel which is also the target of neurotoxins and a             
              variety of sedative, anxiety-relieving agents and alcohol.                     
              Recently a new novel GABA-A receptor has been discovered in the                
              human eye and its primary gene structure has been elucidated.                  
              Although its primary structure is similar to the previously                    
              characterized GABA-A receptor its physiological function is largely            
              unknown.  These studies are directed at furthering our                         
              understanding of the interaction between retinal cells, the                    
              function of the inhibitory neurotransmitter in signal processing in            
              the retina.  A combined electrophysiological investigation of the              
              receptor activation on the retinal cells with molecular biological             
              techniques to produce mutants of the normal receptor will be used              
              to uncover structure/function relationships of this receptor.
