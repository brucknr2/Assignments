Abstract    :
              The purpose of this research is to determine whether a                         
              contractual approach to the labor market can help explain the                  
              movements of wages and hours worked over the business cycle.                   
              Important, preliminary findings using the contract approach have               
              already shown great promise for analyzing these movements.  The                
              project will involve extending this preliminary work in several                
              directions in order to further assess the empirical relevance of               
              contracts in explaining labor market outcomes.  Firstly, the type              
              of contract model which is most consistent with individual level               
              wage data will be developed and tested.  Secondly, research will               
              focus on how to estimate the intertemporal substitutability of                 
              leisure when employment relations are governed by long term                    
              contracts.  Thirdly, individual level data from several different              
              counties will be used to investigate how labor market flexibility              
              can be compared when employment relations are governed by                      
              contracts.  Finally, a market clearing contract model will be                  
              analyzed to determine whether such a model can explain the                     
              aggregate behavior of employment levels over the business cycle.               
              This project is important because it will provide useful insights              
              into the nature of the movement of wages subject to contractual                
              relations over the business cycle.
