Abstract    :
              This study will investigate the                                                
              clearance of liquid obstructions                                               
              from pulmonary airways through the                                             
              use of mathematical models.  This                                              
              will be done by investigating the                                              
              relationship between airway lining-                                            
              fluid characteristics and airway                                               
              structural properties on the                                                   
              pressures and stresses associated                                              
              with the clearance of pulmonary                                                
              obstructions.  The study also will                                             
              determine how insoluble surfactant                                             
              and applied pressure influence wall                                            
              stresses during the clearance of                                               
              obstructed airways.  Finally, the                                              
              project will evaluate how the                                                  
              transport of surfactant from the                                               
              bulk-phase to the surface-phase                                                
              within the obstruction influence                                               
              the applied pressures and resulting                                            
              wall stresses during the clearance                                             
              of obstructed airways.                                                         
                                                                                             
              The research may lead to improve                                               
              methods to clear pulmonary airway                                              
              obstructions.  The innovative                                                  
              methods applied in this study also                                             
              may be useful in investigating                                                 
              interfacial phenomena and transport                                            
              processes in other areas.
