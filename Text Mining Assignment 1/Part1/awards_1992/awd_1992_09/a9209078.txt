Abstract    :
              The goal of this research is to                                                
              develop a three-dimensional dynamic                                            
              mathematical model of the human                                                
              knee joint. Previous                                                           
              three-dimensional models either                                                
              have been static or quasi-static                                               
              and, therefore, the models cannot                                              
              predict the effects of dynamic                                                 
              inertial loads which occur in many                                             
              locomotor activities.  Only                                                    
              two-dimensional dynamic models have                                            
              been investigated to date.                                                     
                                                                                             
              The model that will be developed                                               
              will consist of two body segments,                                             
              a femur and a tibia, constrained by                                            
              ligamentous forces.  Changes that                                              
              occur with time in joint position,                                             
              joint reaction forces, contact                                                 
              point locations between femur and                                              
              tibia, and ligament forces will be                                             
              calculated.                                                                    
                                                                                             
              This research is important since it                                            
              will lead to a more complete                                                   
              knowledge of how knee injuries                                                 
              occur.  Most damage to the knee                                                
              takes place in dynamic situations,                                             
              which is the focus of this project.                                            
              The approach that will be develop                                              
              also could be used in modeling                                                 
              other articulating joints.
