              State/Industry University Cooperative Research Center on Rock Mechanics (RMMC)
              was established in 1992 with matching funds from the NSF, the State of Oklahoma
              and a consortium of 14 oil and gas producing companies.  The Center's
              objectives are to apply and integrate advanced geoscience and engineering
              concepts to issues related to the oil and gas industries.  The Center's
              research program addresses both short and long term goals to solve the
              geological problems associated with unstable rock formations that cause
              collapse of boreholes, reservoir compaction and subsidence.  The information
              generated in the Center's research will be used to develop improved drilling
              technologies in geologically difficult and unstable oil and gas fields.  The
              State of Oklahoma through Oklahoma Center for the Advancement of Science and
              Technology (OCAST) assists RMMC in developing technical cooperation to solve
              the problems of small businesses in the State.  This award is to support the
              Center for in the second year of its operation.
