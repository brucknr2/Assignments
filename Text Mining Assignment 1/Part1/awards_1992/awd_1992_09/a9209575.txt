Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The Age Discrimination in Employment Act was originally enacted in             
              1968.  It was strengthened in 1979 by transferring enforcement                 
              authority to the EEOC, and in 1986 by eliminating mandatory                    
              retirement (for most workers).  The Age Discrimination in                      
              Employment Act, in particular its abolition of mandatory                       
              retirement, has been criticized by some economists as impairing the            
              formation of long-term incentive contracts in labor markets.  In               
              the current accepted model, such contracts require the institution             
              of mandatory retirement.                                                       
                                                                                             
              This critique emphasizes the point that economists' understanding              
              of age discrimination and the Age Discrimination in Employment Act             
              hinges critically on the underlying reasons for the observed                   
              positive relationship between age and earnings, over much of the               
              life cycle.  The proposed research will conduct numerous empirical             
              tests of alternative explanations of this relationship, including:             
              the human capital model; the long-term incentive-contract model;               
              and the hypothesis that workers prefer rising wage profiles.  The              
              research explores theoretical restrictions implied by the                      
              alternative explanations, as well as data sets uniquely suited to              
              distinguishing between them.  The research draws on these empirical            
              tests, as well as other theoretical and empirical results, to                  
              provide an economic assessment of the Age Discrimination in                    
              Employment Act.
