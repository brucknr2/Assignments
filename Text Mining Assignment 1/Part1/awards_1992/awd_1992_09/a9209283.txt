Abstract    :
              This work will investigate natural online versions of the classical            
              network optimization problems:  the minimal spanning tree problem, the         
              shortest path problem, the min-cost max-flow problem, the weighted             
              matching problem, and the traveling salesman problem.  In these                
              problems an online algorithm must begin constructing a partial                 
              solution before all of the underlying network becomes known.  Hence,           
              it is generally not possible for the online algorithm to know whether          
              a particular partial solution will extend to an optimal global                 
              solution.  The hallmark of these problems is that it is impractical,           
              or even impossible, to restructure the partial solution when further           
              information about the network becomes known.  The online algorithm's           
              goal is thus to iteratively construct a solution that is close to              
              optimal without significant restructuring from one partial solution to         
              the next.
