Abstract    :
              This grant investigates how ordinary citizens act against and/or               
              in accord with totalitarian states imposing societal control                   
              through the use of terror.  Specifically, the project focuses on               
              the role that ordinary German citizens played in struggling against            
              and complying with the system of terror that operated in Nazi                  
              Germany.  It is based on rigorous quantitative and qualitative                 
              examination of thousands of previously unexamined arrest and court             
              records in three German cities.  Analysis of these data enables                
              differentiation between which types of people supported Nazism and             
              which did not.  Further, it will allow for empirical analysis of               
              whether and how the Gestapo-led system of terror was dependent on              
              ordinary citizens for its success in stamping out potential                    
              collective resistence to the Nazi regime.                                      
                                                                                             
              In addition to filling in an important empirical gap on how                    
              ordinary citizens responded to and interacted with this system of              
              terror, it provides a general model for investigating the                      
              politicization of crime and the judiciary as an instrument of                  
              social control.  Also, this model will have wide relevance to                  
              scholars interested in totalitarian societies, their maintenance,              
              and their breakdown as an internal dynamic.
