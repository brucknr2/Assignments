Abstract    :
                   Geometric Programming is an established technique for solving             
              certain classes of algebraic, nonlinear optimization problems.  It             
              has been applied to problems in a variety of areas, and has been               
              especially useful in engineering design.  In this project, an                  
              alternative approach to geometric programming will be analyzed                 
              which replaces the nonlinear primal-dual pair with a linear                    
              equivalent.  Specifically, the project will (1) develop, code,                 
              test, and implement and algorithm based on the reformulation,(2)               
              adapt sensitivity analysis procedures from linear optimization to              
              geometric programming, (3) adapt linear programming decomposition              
              principles to large geometric programming problems where the                   
              constraint sets can be partitioned based on the design variables               
              that appear in them, (4) characterize multiple optima in geometric             
              problems which possess the same, and (5) explore the approximation             
              of certain classes of general nonlinear programs by geometric                  
              programming.
