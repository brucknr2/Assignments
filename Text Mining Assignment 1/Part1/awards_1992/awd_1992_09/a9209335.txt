Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  The objective of this research is nonlinear thermal convection            
              in layers heated from below.  The goal of the research is the                  
              elucidation of basic mechanisms in laminar and turbulent convection            
              and their use for the interpretation of observed features in the               
              atmospheres of the Earth and other planets.  In particular:                    
                                                                                             
              1.   To analyze the nonlinear properties of time-periodic                      
                   convection and its stability characteristics.  After earlier              
                   research has focussed on traveling wave convection, the                   
                   attention will be focussed now on the more complex case of                
                   oscillatory blob convection.                                              
                                                                                             
              2.   The interaction of convection with a mean shear flow will be              
                   extended to the case of a horizontal layer rotating about a               
                   vertical axis.                                                            
                                                                                             
              3.   Three-dimensional states of convection evolving from the                  
                   instability of transverse rolls in an inclined layer will be              
                   investigated.                                                             
                                                                                             
              4.   Steady bimodal convection cells and their instability will be             
                   analyzed in the case of asymmetric boundary conditions.                   
                                                                                             
              5.   The numerical study of convection in rotating spherical fluid             
                   shells will be extended to higher Taylor- and Rayleigh                    
                   numbers.
