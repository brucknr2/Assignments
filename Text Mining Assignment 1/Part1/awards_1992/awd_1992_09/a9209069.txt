Abstract    :
              Unsteady aerodynamic loads are of fundamental importance in the                
              modelling of such phenomena as aerodynamic flutter, forces during              
              high angle of attack air-craft maneuvers, loads due to gusts, and              
              unsteady forces on high speed rotor-craft.  Methods of analysis                
              vary in accordance to the time dependence of the forces involved.              
              For example, the forces on a slowly oscilatting airfoil can be                 
              adequately determined using a simple quasi-steady model.  More                 
              dynamic problems, involving high angles of attack, require                     
              numerical methods accounting for shed vorticity (characteristics               
              of the wake downstream of the airfoil).  During the course of study            
              leading to a Ph.D., Mr. Diaz, under the guidance of his advisor,               
              Jewel Barlow, will apply a numerical method on unsteady aerodynamic            
              research projects currently underway at the University of Maryland.            
              This research is expected to ultimately lead to a better                       
              understanding of unsteady aerodynamic effects.                                 
              A two year continuing renewal award is recommended.
