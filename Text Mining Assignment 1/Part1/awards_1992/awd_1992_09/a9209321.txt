Abstract    :
               It has long been the goal of many researchers to measure the                  
              effects of the extraordinary technical improvements in computing               
              markets.  Yet is has been very difficult to place an economic value            
              on such improvements.   One means for doing so measures a buyer's              
              satisfaction with a product, or "buyer's surplus" -- the difference            
              between what a buyer was willing to pay and what he actually paid.             
              A proper measure of buyer's surplus provides an index of the value             
              to users from a cheaper system or a technically more proficient                
              system.  What has prevented research on surplus in the computer                
              market is a absence of sufficiently detailed data on the micro-                
              behavior of computer users.  This research will fill this gap.  It             
              will develop and use a detailed and rich new data set containing               
              about 70 percent of all medium to large computer users in the                  
              United States.   A related goal  of this research is to shed light             
              on the many factors influencing the diffusion on new computer                  
              equipment.  Since much technical improvement is embodied in new                
                                                                                             
              generations of hardware, the economy can only benefit from                     
              technical advance when that new generation of equipment is                     
              purchased.  This research will approach these issues as questions              
              about the factors underlying the demand for computing.  It will                
              analyze the factors determining the decision to adopt technically              
              advanced computing equipment.
