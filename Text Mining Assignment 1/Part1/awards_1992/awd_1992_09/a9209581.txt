Abstract    :
              The heat transfer behavior for a novel micro-configured heat                   
              sink for cooling high flux micro-electronic components is                      
              proposed. The concept makes use of two-phase cooling, with                     
              large numbers of small cavities (e.g. pyramidal re-entrant                     
              cavities on the order of 10 m and up to 420 cavities per cm2)                 
              etched directly on the silicon wafer. Such cavities have been                  
              demonstrated to entrap vapor, and hence acting as stable                       
              nucleation sites. Another advantage is that the heat sink is                   
              integrated into the wafer itself, eliminating the additional                   
              resistance due to heat sink to heat source bonding. Parameters                 
              which would minimize temperature overshoot will be                             
              investigated, including shape, size and density of the etched                  
              features. Their effect on fully developed nucleate boiling                     
              will also be investigated.
