Abstract    :
              The overall objective of this Research Initiation                              
              Award grant is to understand how hot-electron                                  
              degradation impacts circuit and system                                         
              performance.  In order to evaluate the reliability                             
              of different circuit classes, a hierarchical                                   
              framework will be formulated.  Within this                                     
              functional classification, fundamental subcircuits,                            
              along with their key performance parameters                                    
              and typical operating conditions will be                                       
              identified.  Using analytical modeling, numerical                              
              circuit and reliability simulations, and                                       
              experimental measurements, the specific                                        
              relationship between subcircuit performance and                                
              individual device degradation will be established.                             
              Based on these results, new hot-electron                                       
              reliability criteria will be formulated that are                               
              based on circuit and system performance                                        
              requirements.  In addition, general guidelines                                 
              will be created for designing hot-electron                                     
              reliability into circuits.  These goals will allow                             
              future VLSI circuits and technologies to be                                    
              developed for maximum performance and                                          
              reliability.
