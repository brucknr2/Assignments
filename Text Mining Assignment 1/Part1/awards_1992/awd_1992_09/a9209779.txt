Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This Research Initiation Award will initiate development of an                 
              experimental program to enable quantitative evaluation of the                  
              full, two-dimensional kinematic fields within a complex                        
              viscoelastic flow.  A video-based particle-tracking technique                  
              referred to as Digital Particle Image Velocimetry is used                      
              which employs high resolution monochrome CCD cameras and fast                  
              digital signal processing algorithms to eliminate the                          
              time-consuming photographic and optomechanical steps                           
              associated with conventional particle-imaging methodologies.                   
                                                                                             
              The apparatus will be used in detailed studies of the flow                     
              instabilities that develop during the slow flow of highly                      
              viscoelastic materials through model geometries that are                       
              characteristic of typical industrial processes.
