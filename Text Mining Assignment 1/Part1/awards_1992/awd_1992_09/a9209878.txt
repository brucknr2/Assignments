Abstract    :
                   This proposal seeks funding to develop seismic tomography                 
              software for three dimensional anisotropic media.  The software                
              will be used in geophysical and geotechnical applications.  It                 
              would incorporate a method of estimating uncertainties that is                 
              based on quantifying the effect of a fixed number of random                    
              perturbations of observations on the solution.  The software                   
              would be tested using seismic data obtained from small scale                   
              isotropic and anisotropic models constructed in the laboratory.                
              The proposed study represents a new direction of research for the              
              principal investigator that should lead to more interdisciplinary              
              studies with colleagues in computer science and civil                          
              engineering.
