Abstract    :
              9209740  PANG  Vacuum devices, although still in the development stage, have
              already show significantly promise in a number of applications.  Besides being
              able to operated at very high frequency and immune to radiation, it has been
              recently demonstrated as a product for flat panel display in France.  One of
              the major drawbacks for vacuum devices is related to the fabrication
              technology.  A number of issues have yet to be resolved before the devices can
              achieve its full potential.  The emitters properties including their
              electrical, thermal, mechanical stability are often not optimized.  To improve
              the performance of these devices, alternative materials and new fabrication
              technology have to be developed.    In this project, field emitter arrays for
              vacuum devices will be fabricated.  Two new materials will be tested as
              emitters, including WSi2 and InP.  For Wsi2 emitters, it will be formed by
              either sintering W deposited on Si emitters or by patterning WSi2 that is
              deposited directly on the substrate.  High resolution patterning techniques
              including electron beam and masked ion beam lithography will be used to define
              emitters with submicrometer dimensions in resist.  Wet chemical etching and dry
              etching techniques will be for generating vertical profiles for the emitters. 
              The emitter tips will be sharpened by various dry etching conditions after the
              vertical emitters are formed, including faceting, undercutting, mask erosion,
              and dopant dependent dry etching.  In order for the vacuum devices to be
              operational in air, a sealed triode structure will be fabricated using double
              angle evaporation.  ***
