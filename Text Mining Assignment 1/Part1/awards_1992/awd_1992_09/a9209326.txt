Abstract    :
                   The mathematical theory of discontinuous solutions to                     
              hyperbolic systems is developing intensively motivated by                      
              problems from continuum physics which model reactive flows,                    
              multiphase flows, and elastoplastic flows, for example.  The                   
              principal investigator will focus on methods of approximation for              
              these problems and their convergence to physical discontinuous                 
              solutions.                                                                     
                   A better understanding of the methods of numerical                        
              approximation for some fundamental hyperbolic problems arising in              
              continuum physics has profound real world implications.  These                 
              ideas carry over to such initiatives as materials processing.
