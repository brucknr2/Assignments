Abstract    :
              Work in parallel processing for Computational Field Simulation                 
              (CFS) problems has highlighted the need for techniques to                      
              support efficient mapping of large dataspace problems between                  
              memory hierarchies in an efficient manner so that data is                      
              available to the processors when they are ready to use it.                     
              Typical memory hierarchies to date have good support for                       
              programs with small working-set sizes and good locality of                     
              reference.  Problems in the CFS domain typically deal with                     
              huge data-sets and solution techniques which make passes over                  
              the entire data-set have very poor locality of reference.  The                 
              focus of this research is an investigation into software                       
              techniques for allowing applications programmers to describe                   
              the data access patterns for their application to allow a                      
              hardware system to be built to efficiently manage the data                     
              movement between the different levels of a memory hierarchy to                 
              provide data to the processor at peak speed.  This work will                   
              involve the simulation of this system so that its effective                    
              performance enhancements can be analyzed to determine the                      
              feasibility of such an approach.
