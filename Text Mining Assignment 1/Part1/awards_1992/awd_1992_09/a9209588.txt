Abstract    :
              This Research Planning Grant will enable Dr Angelika Rigos to                  
              initiate a research program studying the effect of hydrodynamic                
              interactions on the behavior of colloidal suspensions. Many                    
              body hydrodynamic interactions will be included in model                       
              studies of hydrodymaic through the use of simulation methods.                  
              Much of the early work will entail making the simulations more                 
              efficient so that enough experimentation can be accomplished to                
              determine realistic models to treat sheared colloidal                          
              suspensions. Subsequent work will entail validating the results                
              through the comparison to experiment.

              Research Planning Grants are awarded to women who have not yet                 
              received federal funding for their research. Dr. Rigos will be                 
              initiating a program which involves computer modelling and                     
              simulations on the very complex problem of the flow of                         
              colloidal suspensions. This work is of considerable importance                 
              to the understanding of the transport of materials in the                      
              environment.
