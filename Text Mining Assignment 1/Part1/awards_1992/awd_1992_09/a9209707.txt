Abstract    :
              An electrochemical junction will be formed                                     
              which mimics an neural synapse.  This device                                   
              will be on a scale of a few microns wide by a                                  
              fraction of a micron thick.  The ionic solution                                
              will be sealed into a stable gel structure.  The                               
              device will be in a form that can be produced                                  
              as arrays and incorporated into standard                                       
              electronics to provide a physical model for the                                
              synapse that can be tested in conjunction with                                 
              studies of neural networks.  Reinforcement of                                  
              individual junctions and short-time                                            
              modification of network properties will be                                     
              incorporated to allow studies of "memory" and                                  
              "mood" in networks.
