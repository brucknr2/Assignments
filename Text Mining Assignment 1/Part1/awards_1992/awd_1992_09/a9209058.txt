Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The role of electron-electron interaction in systems with moderate             
              disorder is poorly understood but it is critically important to                
              understanding quantum transport and the metal-insulator transition.            
              They propose to measure the effect of this interaction for a system            
              in which, for the first time, both the strength of the interaction             
              and the degree of disorder are controllable.  The investigation                
              will provide solid experimental data to fill the gap between the               
              theoretically treated regimes of weak and strong disorder, and                 
              should also have potential technological impact.
