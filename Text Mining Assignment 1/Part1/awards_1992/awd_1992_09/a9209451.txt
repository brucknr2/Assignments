Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The elucidation of mechanisms involved in necrotic cell death is               
              important for understanding development, homeostasis and pathology             
              in the nervous system.  In the leech, dominant mutations in two                
              genes, mec-4 and deg-I, induce the death of specific groups of                 
              neurons.  Dying neurons are characterized by morphological changes             
              commonly observed in cells undergoing a necrotic type of cell                  
              death.  Mec-4 plays a key role in the degeneration of six touch                
              receptor neurons, by directly killing cells or by generating a                 
              signal that activates a "death program".  Light and electron                   
              microscopy will be utilized to document the process of degeneration            
              of the touch cells.  Antibodies against the mec-4 protein will be              
              used to follow the fate of this protein in normal and dying touch              
              cells.  The simplicity of the leech nervous system offers                      
              advantages for dissecting cell death mechanisms using genetic,                 
              molecular and cellular approaches.  These studies promise to                   
              contribute to our understanding of how mutant proteins can induce              
              neuronal cell death.
