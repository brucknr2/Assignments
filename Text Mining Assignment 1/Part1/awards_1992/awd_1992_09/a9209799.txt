Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                                                                                            
              This project involves the dissertation research of an                          
              anthropology student from the University of California - Irvine.               
              The student will study the Asian-American community in three                   
              places in Alaska -- Anchorage, Kodiak and Nome.  The project                   
              gathers demographic information and studies migration patterns,                
              employment and occupations, and cultural retention and changes,                
              and interracial ad inter-ethnic interactions.  It will use                     
              multiple methods including respondent interviews, participant                  
              observation, survey questionnaires and key informant protocols.                
                                                                                             
              This research is important because inter-ethnic and inter-racial               
              strife is a major fact of life in many areas.  This case study of              
              how a complex Asian community fits into a complex Alaskan social               
              setting can help us understand general principles of community                 
              conflict and adaptation.
