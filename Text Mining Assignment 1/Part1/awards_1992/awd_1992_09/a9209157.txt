Abstract    :
              The current state-of-the-art for                                               
              bioprocess measurements is based on                                            
              dated technology.  A new generic                                               
              technology that can measure a                                                  
              number of analytes using a common                                              
              principle is greatly needed.  Phase                                            
              fluorometry promises to bridge this                                            
              gap based on a simple principle: a                                             
              fluorophore exhibits a lifetime                                                
              change in response to an analyte,                                              
              which can be measured as a phase                                               
              angle change when the probe is                                                 
              excited with intensity modulated

              exploit recent advances in                                                     
              chemistry, optics, and
