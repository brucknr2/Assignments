Abstract    :
              The long term goal of this project is to determine the crystals                
              structures of heme containing enzymes.  The main tools to be                   
              employed this work are those of protein x-ray crystallography.  The            
              project focuses on the crystal structure determination of lignin               
              peroxidase (or ligninase) and mutant forms of cytochrome c                     
              peroxidase.

              This new structural information is expected to broaden our data                
              base on two fundamental mechanistic questions: first, the mechanism            
              by which heme enzymes activate molecular oxygen and/or                         
              hydroperoxides; and second, the mechanism by which electrons                   
              transfer between proteins in intermolecular complexes.
