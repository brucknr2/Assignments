Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This project launches the creation of a new class of                           
              playground apparatus based on an emerging understanding of how                 
              students learn mathematics and science concepts.  The                          
              equipment will be highly interactive and instrumented,                         
              providing opportunities for thoughtful, planned actions that                   
              children can evaluate with the aid of instrumentation.  The                    
              design principles used are applicable to many mathematics and                  
              science topics, but this initial demonstration is restricted                   
              to creating units which embody some important concepts from                    
              classical mechanics.  We will create, test, evaluate, and                      
              begin the dissemination of units incorporating timing, motion,                 
              and force sensor electronics designed to give children real-                   
              time, symbolic feedback to reflect their experiences.                          
                                                                                             
              The first nine months will be devoted to the apparatus design,                 
              building, testing, safety evaluation, and formative research.                  
              We will install apparatus in three highly varied sites to                      
              evaluate the design.  In a second phase, improved units will                   
              be built for one site and detailed research on student                         
              learning undertaken.  If we observe the hypothesized learning,                 
              the approach we use in mechanics will have broad                               
              generalizability.  This work could lead to interesting and                     
              highly educational apparatus addressing other science fields                   
              and useful in a broad range of informal learning environments.
