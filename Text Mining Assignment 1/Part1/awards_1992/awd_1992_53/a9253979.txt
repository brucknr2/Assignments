Abstract    :
              Astronomy and Writing:  An Innovative Approach to Science                      
              Instruction                                                                    
              The goal of this project is to help incoming students develop                  
              critical thinking skills and a better understanding of basic                   
              scientific principles.  The goal of the project is to construct                
              an astronomy workbook which utilizes both math and writing. At                 
              New Mexico State University a large portion of the student body                
              is Hispanic, so particular care is being given to constructing                 
              exercises appropriate to this group. The workbook will utilize                 
              the techniques of "Writing-Across-the-Curriculum" (WAC).                       
              Numerous investigations have found that a strong relation                      
              exists between writing and learning. Writing has also been                     
              shown to be an effective tool in physics and math instruction.                 
              The project is designed to exploit the values of writing as a                  
              learning tool in astronomy. The incorporation of WAC techniques                
              into a beginning astronomy class, at this level, is a unique                   
              experiment.  The intent is that the project serve as a                         
              prototype for future efforts in the physical sciences at New                   
              Mexico State University and that the material developed here be                
              transportable to other institutions.
