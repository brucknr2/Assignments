Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                                                                                            
              The Emeritus Foundation plans to network volunteer retired                     
              scientists, engineers, and mathematicians with approximately                   
              700 elementary school teachers in the Washington D.C. schools                  
              over a three year period.  Building on an existing program,                    
              the project will enable retired professionals to supplement                    
              science and mathematics offerings at the elementary level by                   
              working closely with teachers and students both in and out of                  
              the classroom. Activities include classroom hands-on                           
              demonstrations, field trips, mentoring, and workshops for both                 
              teachers and volunteers to maximize the effectiveness of the                   
              other activities and to design instructional activities and                    
              materials.  In addition, manuals will be created to assist                     
              with the training of new volunteers for the program.  The                      
              project is designed as a model which can be                                    
              replicated in other urban areas which have large populations                   
              of underrepresented students.
