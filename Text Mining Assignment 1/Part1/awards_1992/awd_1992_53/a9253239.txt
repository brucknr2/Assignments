Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This three year project, sponsored by the University of Alabama at             
              Birmingham, provides a program to teach 30 outstanding high school             
              chemistry teachers laboratory techniques.  Participants will learn all         
              phase of chemistry laboratory operations with emphasis on laboratory           
              management and safety.  At the end of the program these teachers will          
              be certified as Laboratory Management Specialists and will carry out           
              in-service training for other teachers.  The project has a follow-up           
              component which supports the teachers as they conduct in-service work.         
              The matching funds from the University and participating schools               
              constitute an amount equal to 27% of the NSF grant.
