Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              WHALES, SHARKS & THINGS IN THE DARK - A 70MM IMAX FILM is the                  
              first science museum and aquarium film in the 70MM large-screen                
              format to present the diversity of life in the oceans in a                     
              science context.  Through a unique collaboration of a national                 
              environmental education group, a leading non-profit science                    
              center, and with the co-operation of a federal agency, the                     
              project's main objective is to convey to a general and school-                 
              age audience a view of the richness and range of life in the                   
              underwater realm -- from the deep sea creatures to whales and                  
              sharks and other marine life.  Narratively, the film will                      
              proceed through the water column and selected food webs, showing               
              the relationships in the complex skein of life--including human.               
              The audience will be guided by explorers and role-model                        
              scientists, such as Dr. Sylvia Earle, an enthusiastic and well-                
              known oceanographer, and three other sets of characters involved               
              in marine science and exploration.  The content will highlight                 
              a range of scientific disciplines, including marine biology,                   
              engineering, geology, physics, and oceanography, and it will                   
              shed light on the entire study of the oceans as a career path,                 
              and as an area for further investigation.  Accompanied by a                    
              educational package delivered and supported by all three groups,               
              this film will have wide impact, reaching a projected 8 million                
              U.S. viewers within two years.
