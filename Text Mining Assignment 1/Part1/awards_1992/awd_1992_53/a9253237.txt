Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Dr. James Bower is a biologist on the faculty of the                           
              California Institute of Technology, and an active proponent                    
              of inquiry-based hands-on science education.  Dr. Bower has                    
              designed a project that will an NSF-supported elementary                       
              teacher enhancement effort in the Pasadena Unified School                      
              District (PUSD) to the middle school level.  Project SEED                      
              (Science for Early Educational Development) is being                           
              supported by a four-year award from the Teacher Enhancement                    
              Program to establish a hands on inquiry-based instructional                    
              program in all of the 22 elementary schools in PUSD.  The                      
              students entering middle school are encountering a                             
              traditional textbook/lecture format in science class, and                      
              parents have begun to demand expansion of the outstanding                      
              elementary school instruction to the upper grades (3,500                       
              students in 5 middle schools).  This project will train                        
              teachers in the use of hands on science kits, establish a                      
              materials support system for refurbishment of kits, engage                     
              scientists from the community in teacher workshops and in                      
              classroom activities, and encourage integration of science                     
              with other curricular subjects through additional summer                       
              workshops.                                                                     
                                                                                             
              This project will create a comprehensive and integrated K-8                    
              science curriculum for the public schools in Pasadena, and                     
              will prepare all middle school teachers responsible for                        
              science instruction to deliver exemplary learning                              
              experiences.  The collaboration between Cal Tech and the                       
              Pasadena Unified School District has been a productive                         
              partnership, and the expansion of the project from                             
              elementary to middle schools is a model for other districts                    
              to follow.                                                                     
                                                                                             
              Cost sharing by the University and school district                             
              represents 104% of the NSF contribution.
