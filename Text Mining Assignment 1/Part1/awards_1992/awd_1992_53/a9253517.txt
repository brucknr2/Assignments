Abstract    :
              The research project of this Presidential Faculty Fellow is in the             
              general area of analytical and surface chemistry and in the                    
              subfield of nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy.  During             
              the two-year tenure of this award, Professor Shaka and his                     
              students will utilize innovative magic angle spinning, cross                   
              polarization, proton decoupling, and pulse sequence techniques to              
              obtain chemical information from NMR spectra that is                           
              characteristic of selected, local regions of samples.  This                    
              approach to materials characterization has broad applications in               
              such areas as organic solids and polymers, reactions at                        
              interfaces, isotopically doped porus materials, layered solids,                
              and materials defects analysis.

              This Presidential Faculty Fellowship, which subsumes the final two             
              years of Professor Shaka's Presidential Young Investigator Award               
              (CHE-8957560), should significantly assist him in the continuing               
              development of his vital, innovative, and productive program of                
              research and research training.
