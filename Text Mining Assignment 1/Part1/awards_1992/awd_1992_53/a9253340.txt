Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The Foundation for Advancements in Science and Education                       
              (FASE) is offering a two-year professional development                         
              project for secondary mathematics teachers.  This project is                   
              designed to help teachers motivate students' interest in                       
              mathematics through effective classroom use of the PBS                         
              Instructional Television series "FUTURES, with Jaime                           
              Escalante" and student materials which are under development                   
              in the Multimedia Math Project (MMP), funded by the NSF                        
              Instructional Materials Development Program.  The project                      
              will test and evaluate workshops for teachers to enhance the                   
              effective classroom use of both FUTURES and MMP; develop                       
              Workshop Facilitator Kits, which are the materials needed to                   
              produce such local workshops at nominal cost; and produce a                    
              multimedia (laser disk and supporting print material)                          
              presentation which will provide teachers with exemplary                        
              examples of motivational teaching strategies.                                  
                                                                                             
              Cost share of approximately 35% of the award is provided by                    
              the Department of Energy and by businesses such as ARCO and                    
              IBM.
