Abstract    :
              Dr. Kadonaga is an outstanding young scientist, with an exemplary              
              research career to date.  His credentials are impeccable, his                  
              research plan is excellent, and he is already at the forefront of              
              his field.  The objective of this award is to examine the                      
              relationship between chromatin structure and gene activity in                  
              eukaryotes.  Recent findings on the mechanism of transcriptional               
              activation by sequence specific factors strongly suggest that                  
              dynamic interactions between chromatin and the transcription                   
              factors are involved in the regulation of gene expression.  These              
              transcriptional "activators" may actually function as                          
              antirepressors--that is they appear, at least in part, to                      
              counteract repression, stems for reconstitution of chromatin will              
              be developed, and then the resulting chromatin will be used as                 
              template for in vitro transcription analysis. These studies should             
              lead to a better understanding of the process of gene activation.

              The objective of this award is to enhance his research involving               
              examine the relationship between chromatin structure and gene                  
              activity in eukaryotes.  Interactions between chromatin and the                
              transcription factors are involved in the regulation of gene                   
              expression.  Transcriptional "activators may actually function to              
              counteract repression of basal transcription by chromatin.                     
              Different systems for reconstitution of chromatin will be                      
              developed, and then the resulting chromatin will be used as                    
              template for in vitro transcription analysis.  These studies should            
              lead to a better understanding of the process of gene activation.              
              Dr. Kadonaga is exceptionally broad in his research achievements,              
              as well as in his teaching interests and plans.  He will have an               
              important impact on a department as distinguished as UCSD's Biology            
              Department.  There  is no question that he will be a leader in                 
              biological sciences in the future.
