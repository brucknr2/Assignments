Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The Lawrence Hall of Science at the University of California                   
              at Berkeley will be the site of a three-year Primary                           
              Leadership Institute in Science and Mathematics (PRISM) for                    
              teams of K-3 teachers and teacher educators nationwide.                        
              PRISM is based on a previously NSF-funded program, and will                    
              provide education in both content and instructional                            
              strategies, as well as preparing teachers to serve as                          
              specialists and providers of inservice.  A 4-week summer                       
              institute providing 120 hours of educational enhancement to                    
              30 teachers and specialists will be offered each year (90                      
              teachers/3 years).  During the academic year, participants                     
              will receive a regular newsletter, mini-grants to support                      
              school-year leadership activities, and will attend                             
              leadership conferences.  A new facet of this project is the                    
              involvement of 20 teacher educators (60 total) each project                    
              year from institutions nationwide.  These teacher educators                    
              will attend the PRISM Institute for one week to receive                        
              inservice specific to adapting the PRISM model for use with                    
              teachers in their areas.                                                       
                                                                                             
              This leadership proposal is appropriate for teacher                            
              enhancement because it is designed to enhance the science                      
              knowledge and teaching, and develop leadership skills and                      
              efforts of teachers of grades K-3, and because it will also                    
              provide a 1-week workshop for science educators who will be                    
              teamed with teacher participants when possible; thus the                       
              project will have far-reaching impact, not only through the                    
              efforts of teacher participants, but also through the pre-                     
              service and classroom teachers reached by participating                        
              teacher educators.                                                             
                                                                                             
              Non-NSF cost-sharing is approximately 28% of the amount                        
              requested from NSF.
