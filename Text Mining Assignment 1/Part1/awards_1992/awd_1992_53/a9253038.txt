Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The Ecological Society of America and the Association of                       
              Southeastern Biologists will be sponsoring a two-day                           
              workshop in April, 1992 that explores "Ecology in                              
              Education".  This will be the first in a series of regional                    
              workshops that will bring together professional ecologists,                    
              biologists, educational administrators and teachers as                         
              members of state-level teams.  These teams will be informed                    
              of the latest regional and national initiatives in                             
              pre-college science education, and will then collaborate on                    
              identifying the greatest needs in their respective states.                     
              Each team will prepare an action plan that addresses this                      
              need.                                                                          
                                                                                             
              This workshop is a model of the leadership that professional                   
              scientific societies can bring to the problems of precollege                   
              education.  This workshop, and the series of workshops that                    
              may follow, will inform and engage scientists in educational                   
              reform efforts.
