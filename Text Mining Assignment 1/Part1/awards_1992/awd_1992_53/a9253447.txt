Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              WGBH Educational Foundation seeks support from NSF to add a                    
              Science Unit to its Descriptive Video Service.   In their                      
              original proposal they cited three objectives:  to produce                     
              universally available narrative audio descriptions of public                   
              television science program for visually impaired Americans,                    
              to disseminate information regarding the availability of the                   
              programs, and to raise funds for additional program                            
              descriptions.   A modest evaluation plan was included.                         
              With the funds requested here, they will describe NOVA,                        
              NATURE, and THE NEW EXPLORERS.  Other programs will be added                   
              in the subsequent years.  This request is for the support of                   
              the first year of a three-year projection.
