Abstract    :
              This collaborative project is being implemented at the University              
              of Iowa, University of Wisconsin-La Crosse, and Brigham Young                  
              University. Renewed calculus materials developed through the NSF               
              supported project at the University of Iowa will be revised,                   
              tested, and refined at these three institutions.  The project                  
              involves extensive training of faculty and teaching assistants to              
              use these materials and approaches.  In addition to ideas through              
              large open ended projects on a variety of scientific and                       
              mathematical problems.
