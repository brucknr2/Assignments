Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  Our closest living relatives, the apes, reveal remarkable                 
              cognitive  and social abilities in the wild, but it is unclear                 
              whether they show correspondingly advanced vocal skills.  To                   
              resolve this issue, this proposal is the first comparative field               
              study of great ape vocal communication.  Field observations and                
              experiments will be used to investigate the ontogeny, semantics                
              and function of ape calls.  The research  promises to clarify the              
              similarities and differences between human and animal vocal                    
              communication and to contribute to our understanding of the                    
              evolution of speech.
