Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              "Stormchasers" is a 35-minute, IMAX/OMNIMAX film to be                         
              produced, exhibited, and distributed by the Museum Film                        
              Network, NOVA/WGBH Boston, and MacGillivray Freeman Films-the                  
              same team responsible for the critically acclaimed film "To                    
              the Limit."  "Stormchasers" is a tale of scientific discovery                  
              and natural wonder that will take audiences on a journey                       
              around the planet to encounter the origins of the earth's                      
              weather patterns, to experience our most extreme storms                        
              (monsoons, hurricanes, blizzards and tornadoes,) and to                        
              witness scientists who study and predict weather events.                       
              Using a combination of conventional IMAX documentary                           
              filmmaking methods, computer animation, and unique                             
              photography, the film will depict the intricate relationship                   
              between the drama of nature and the efforts of humans to                       
              pursue the systematic understanding of the natural world.  The                 
              film and its ancillary materials will be offered to the 34                     
              space theaters located at U.S. science museums in 1994-1995.                   
              Educational materials will be developed to extend the film's                   
              reach into the classroom.  Special viewing programs will be                    
              offered at science museums, targeting minority, disadvantaged,                 
              and female youth and their teachers.
