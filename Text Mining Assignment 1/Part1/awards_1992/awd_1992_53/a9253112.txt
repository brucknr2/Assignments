Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The long-term objective of this work  is to understand the role                
              of signalling molecules in growth control and pattern formation.               
              The focus of this proposal is the characterization of a novel                  
              Drosophila melanogaster growth factor gene, defective dorsal                   
              discs.                                                                         
                                                                                             
              The objectives are to extend the molecular characterization of                 
              the ddd gene and identify genes in the same signalling pathway.                
              The region encompassing seven DNA lesions that cause ddd                       
              phenotypes has been cloned but because off repetitive motifs, and              
              rarity  of the message, no transcription unit has been found.                  
              Two approaches will be used to identify the transcription unit:                
              in situ hybridization to tissues using probes from the region,                 
              and sequence conservation with Drosophila virills.  Probes from                
              the transcribed region will be used to isolate cDNAs which will                
              be sequenced to predict the encoded protein.  Genomic DNA will be              
              sequenced if no cDNA can be isolated.  The transcription pattern               
              during development will be described.  Phenotypically related                  
              genes will be mapped, checked for complementation with known                   
              genes, and cloned by plasmid rescue.
