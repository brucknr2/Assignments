Abstract    :
              A long-term goal of this project is to understand DNA repair pathways,         
              recovery processes and enzymes important in the complex cellular               
              responses to radiomimetic damage.  this proposal focuses upon the              
              molecular cloning and characterizations of mutants (blm) isolated in           
              this laboratory on the basis of their hypersensitivities to killing by         
              ionizing radiation and a radiomimetic family of chemical congeners.            
              Studies are designed to improve our understanding of radiomimetic              
              damage to eucaryotic cells, how cells respond to and reverse the               
              damage, and multiple mechanisms for processing chromosomal injury.             
              Objectives include determining 1) the BLM1, BLM3, BLM5, and BLM8               
              nuclear genes, gene products and functions, 2) additional genetic and          
              functional relationships among blm genes and relationships of blm              
              genes to specific rad mutations, 3) genetic mapping of the mutations,          
              4) the role of BLM nuclear genes involved in maintaining normal                
              chromosomal structure and function after radiomimetic damage, and              
              5) the relationship of chromatic lesions and their repair to cellular          
              survival and recovery.  Genetic characterizations, molecular cloning           
              and sequence analyses, DNA repair techniques, electrophoretic and              
              sedimentation analyses, and enzyme assays will be utilized.  The               
              genetic sophistication, molecular flexibility and availability of mutant       
              strains of eucaryotic Saccharomyces cerevisiae permit these studies            
              and technical approaches.
