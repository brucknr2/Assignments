Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This Presidential Faculty Fellow Award will support theoretical and            
              computational cosmological studies.  The principal investigator,               
              Dr. Lars Hernquist, will use sophisticated numerical simulations               
              run primarily on supercomputers to investigate the effects of                  
              galaxy collisions and hydrodynamics in multi-component systems on              
              the formation and evolution of galaxies and very large scale                   
              structure in the Universe.
