Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The Geological Society of America (GSA) will organize a                        
              conference in order to design an innovative teacher                            
              enhancement paln that will augment K-12 teachers'                              
              interaction with earth scientists.  Specifically, the goal                     
              of the project is to write a proposal that combines a                          
              mechanism that creates long-term professional relationships                    
              between K-12 educators and the earth science community, with                   
              a regional center which will provide continuing in-service                     
              and support for teachers.                                                      
                                                                                             
              Attendance at the conference is invitational, and will be                      
              held sometime in the fall or winter of 1992-1993.  Cost                        
              share of the project is 16.4%.
