Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The daily radio series EARTH AND SKY began airing nationally on                
              September 30, 1991.  It consists of 2-minute programs about                    
              Earth science and astronomy.  Produced in association with the                 
              American Geophysical Union, it is designed for people of all                   
              ages.  Its aim is to make science accessible and interesting to                
              millions whose common bond is that they happen to be listening                 
              to the radio.                                                                  
                                                                                             
              On February 1, 1992, the series was airing on 63 commercial and                
              public radio stations, which had paid for it, and the number of                
              stations was growing.  Producers and hosts Deborah Byrd and Joel               
              Block were responsible for 5,000 daily programs in the award-                  
              winning STAR DATE radio series.  Partial support is requested                  
              for the production, distribution and promotion of 780 programs                 
              in the EARTH AND SKY series.  The goal for the grant period is                 
              to acquire a large listening audience via heavy promotion.                     
              After three years, EARTH AND SKY will be self-supporting on 371                
              stations, more stations than for any previous series of this                   
              king.
