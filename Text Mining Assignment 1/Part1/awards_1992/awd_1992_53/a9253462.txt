Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Project Enhanced Science Learning (PESL) offers learning                       
              partners opportunities to engage in authentic scientific                       
              inquiry through apprenticeship.  Such inquiry is often                         
              enabled by dynamic interactions among learning partners in                     
              physical proximity.  Yet scientific and business practice                      
              using Internet and broadband services recognizes that not                      
              all partners necessary to an interaction can be co-located.                    
              Our vision uses new technologies to extend the collaborative                   
              "reach" of PESL to include diverse expertise among remote                      
              learners, teachers, and scientists.                                            
                                                                                             
              This work, in atmospheric sciences, extends collaborative                      
              media beyond asynchronous text-only email to shared                            
              workspaces and two-way audio/video connections that allow                      
              for collaborative visualization of science phenomena, data,                    
              models - What You See Is What I See (WYSIWIS).  Tools for                      
              local- and wide-area networked learning environments will                      
              enable highly interactive, media-rich communications among                     
              learning partners.  Research on these learning architectures                   
              will provide pedagogy and social protocols for                                 
              authenticating the science learning experience in classrooms                   
              and other spaces.  Greater motivation to learn and enhanced                    
              science learning in terms of more valid, performance                           
              assessments should result from students' participations.                       
              The next decade brings widespread, networked multi-media                       
              interpersonal computing.  This project will provide a                          
              blueprint to inform the effective use of interpersonal                         
              collaborative media for science education.
