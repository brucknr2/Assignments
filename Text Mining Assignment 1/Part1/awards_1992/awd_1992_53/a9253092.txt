Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Although most of the early events immediately following                        
              fertilization are carried out by maternal factors, the sperm can               
              play a critical role in these early events by triggering egg                   
              activation, contributing a centrosome, and specifying one of the               
              embryonic axes.  However, the identity and function of these                   
              paternal factors involved in egg activation and early development              
              remain unclear since the preliminary biochemical studies are                   
              controversial.                                                                 
                                                                                             
              The objective of this project is to initiate a genetic analysis of             
              these paternally acting factors in the nematode Caenorhabditis                 
              elegans.  Genetic screens will be carried out identify new                     
              paternal effect lethal (pel) mutations and to estimate the number              
              of genes involved.  Phenotypic analysis of these new mutants and               
              of three previously identified pel mutants (emb-27, and fer-14)                
              will be undertaken in order to analyze the function of these                   
              genes.  The most promising mutations from these studies will be                
              selected for subsequent genetic and molecular analysis.
