Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Humboldt State University seeks funds to develop and implement                 
              a program which will reach mathematics faculty members who                     
              teach courses for preservice K-8 teachers.  The goal of the                    
              project is to transform the way preservice mathematics courses                 
              are taught so that mathematics faculty will model the teaching                 
              techniques which prospective K-8 teachers will be expected to                  
              exhibit in their own classrooms.  To achieve this goal,                        
              intensive summer workshops are planned for 300 California                      
              college faculty who will teach over 9,000 students per year,                   
              and other programs which will reach an additional 600 faculty                  
              members.  These workshops and inservice activities focus on:                   
              selection and dissemination of integrated instructional units,                 
              increased use of effective instructional styles, increased                     
              participation in mathematics education reform, improved                        
              networking and discussion among mathematics faculty, and                       
              improved preparation of K-8 teachers who will experience                       
              learning mathematics from instructors who model exemplary                      
              practices for the new teachers to emulate.  University level                   
              materials will be developed for the mathematics courses which                  
              take into consideration the NCTM Standards documents, the MAA                  
              Call for Change and the California Framework as well as other                  
              curriculum and content mathematics project for the precollege                  
              and collegiate levels.  Two year college faculty will                          
              participate in the program.                                                    
                                                                                             
              Cost sharing is approximately 12% of NSF funding.
