Abstract    :
              This proposal focuses on the experiences of emerging women scientists.         
              It charts recent developments in Duke University's efforts to address          
              the underrepresentation of women in science and it proposes a model            
              project to open conversations about the mentor-student relationship.           
              The design of the model project is based on a series of discussions            
              among women scientists (faculty and graduate students) and between             
              these scientists and this project's investigators.  Advanced graduate          
              students in science report to us that they confront mentoring practices        
              and interpersonal behaviors which discourage their advancement.  They          
              argue that these practices and behaviors are seldom described or               
              discussed openly among colleagues and so continue to influence women           
              students' sense of their professional abilities and opportunities, even        
              in the most well meaning of departments.  Our goal is to initiate              
              conversations within the science community about issues related to the         
              education of women as scientists, in order to identify and define the          
              daily obstacles encountered by graduate women in science, sensitize            
              faculty advisers/mentors to these obstacles, discuss faculty advisers'         
              and mentors' concerns about their interactions with graduate women,            
              introduce emerging women scientists to the perspectives that inform            
              diverse mentoring approaches and styles, and develop an approach to            
              evaluating the educational environment for women.
