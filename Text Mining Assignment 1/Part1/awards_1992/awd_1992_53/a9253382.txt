Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The National Center for Atmospheric Research NNCAR) is                         
              developing a traveling interactive exhibit to parallel the                     
              Federal Aviation Administration's (FAA) deployment of Terminal                 
              Doppler Weather Radars (TDWR) at 47 airports across the United                 
              States.  This exhibit, titled "Burstbusters Taming Weather                     
              Hazards to Aviation," will describe how the hazardous weather                  
              phenomena were identifies, how technology was utilized to create               
              a system to detect and predict them, and how the new system will               
              operate at airports to enhance safety and air traffic                          
              efficiency.  large groups of the population not routinely                      
              exposed to science issues will be presented with this case study               
              as an example of how public science funding can directly affect                
              their lives.  The exhibit will capitalize on this linkage to                   
              increase public literacy about the science and technology                      
              processes and to promote parental advocacy of science education                
              for their children.                                                            
                                                                                             
              Two copies of the exhibit will travel to approximately 20                      
              airport terminals and science museums from June 1993 through                   
              September 1995.//
