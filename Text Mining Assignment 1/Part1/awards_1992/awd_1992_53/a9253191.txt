Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Project SEED is a four week summer workshop for middle                         
              school teachers that focuses on the use of inexpensive                         
              materials to teach the basic concepts and principles of                        
              physical science.                                                              
                                                                                             
              The core of the program is a manual of over 150 experiments                    
              and a kit of supporting demonstrations.  In addition to                        
              workshop sessions visits to local research and industrial                      
              facilities and talks by Northeastern University research                       
              faculty are included.                                                          
                                                                                             
              Teachers who have participated in SEED workshop will then                      
              receive two years of leadership training(PRO-SEED) to                          
              prepare them to conduct in-service activity based workshops                    
              in their own school districts. This after school program of                    
              "teachers teaching teachers" will be named EX-SEED.                            
                                                                                             
              An additional component of the project is to train retired                     
              scientists to act as Science Resource Agents(SRA'S) within                     
              the schools(RE-SEED)                                                           
                                                                                             
              Over the 46 months of funding 48 leader teachers, 16 peer                      
              teachers and 70 retired technical professionals will be                        
              taught.                                                                        
                                                                                             
              Additional features of the program involve the use of:                         
              * Live interactive telecasts distributed by Massachusett's                     
              Corporation for Educational Telecommunications(MCET)                           
              satellite network to EX-SEED leaders and participants prior                    
              to each EX-SEED workshop.                                                      
              * Museum-style corridor exhibits to be distributed within                      
              the schools for students.                                                      
                                                                                             
              Cost sharing is estimated at 85%.
