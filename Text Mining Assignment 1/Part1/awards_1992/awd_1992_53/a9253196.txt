Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The Southeastern Regional Education Service Center of New                      
              Hampshire has initiated a series of planning activities that                   
              will establish action plans for reform of elementary and                       
              middle school science instruction in 13 school districts.                      
              These districts include 20 elementary and 10 middle schools,                   
              representing 25% of the state's total K-12 enrollment.  The                    
              planning activities will include 1) surveys to establish the                   
              status of and needs for improved science instruction in each                   
              district, and 2) training and planning workshops for                           
              district teams (principals, teachers, district                                 
              administrators).  Each team will use the training workshops                    
              to develop action plans leading to adoption of hands-on                        
              inquiry-based curricula and teaching practices.                                
                                                                                             
              The planning activities described above will initiate an                       
              important reform effort within each district, and will                         
              create a regional network of collaborating reformers.  This                    
              planning process is critical to the long-term success of the                   
              effort, and will serve as a model for other consortia of                       
              small school districts.                                                        
                                                                                             
              Cost sharing amounts to 29% of the NSF contribution.
