Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This is a pilot for a half-hour, weekly children's science                     
              education series produced for broadcast on PBS by                              
              McKenna/Gottlied Productions, Inc. and KCTS Television in                      
              Seattle, Washington.  One half-hour program and prototype                      
              ancillary material will be produced and tested with children,                  
              parents, and teachers.                                                         
                                                                                             
              The series is designed to make science accessible and                          
              interesting to children ages 9 to 12 by relating science to                    
              their interests and everyday activities and by presenting basic                
              concepts from elementary science curricula in a humorous and                   
              exciting format.  The host is Bill Nye, a popular television                   
              entertainer and science aficionado.  In each program, Nye is                   
              assisted by children, well-known science experts, and celebrity                
              guests.  Experiments and demonstrations will use inexpensive,                  
              safe household items to enable viewers to follow along at home                 
              or in the classroom.  Ancillary material will consist of a                     
              parent's guide to assist parents in encouraging their children                 
              to participate in science activities and develop problem-solving               
              skills, activity cards for children to encourage self-directed                 
              learning, and a teacher's guide to support classroom use.
