Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The Fort Worth Museum of Science and History in Texas will                     
              develop a 4,000 square-foot traveling science exhibit on                       
              FORENSICS:  The Science of Criminal Investigation for                          
              circulation to eight major U.S. Cities through the Science                     
              Museum Exhibit Collaborative (SMEC).  FORENSICS will examine the               
              scientific methods and technologies used in today's crime labs.                
              Core science areas are:  DNA profiling; Fingerprinting; Firearms               
              Identification; Evidence Collection; Composites; Forensic                      
              Anthropology; Forensic Entomology; Forensic Geology; Odontology;               
              Pathology; Serology; toxicology; Trace Evidence.  The                          
              development of FORENSICS will draw from the expertise of a                     
              distinguished panel of forensic scientists, law enforcement                    
              officers, and science educators.                                               
                                                                                             
              FORENSICS will foster science process skills, problem-solving,                 
              and deductive reasoning by challenging visitors to solve a crime               
              mystery.  A Teacher's Resource Guide to the exhibit will promote               
              indepth classroom investigations of forensics for middle grade                 
              (5-9) science lessons.  The exhibit will open in Fort Worth in                 
              May of 1993, and then tour nationally to eight major U.S.                      
              cities, serving over 2.5 million American citizens during its                  
              SMEC travel itinerary.//
