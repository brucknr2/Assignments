Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The Multimedia Math Project (MMP) will create a versatile                      
              multimedia video product which motivates students, directly                    
              links the basic math principles they are learning to real                      
              world applications, and gives educators insight into the                       
              teaching methods of Jaime Escalante and two other super                        
              teachers.  It will consist of multiple vignettes addressing                    
              approximately 20 math concepts, and targeted at prealgebra                     
              courses.  These vignettes will help teachers answer the                        
              questions of "what is this math good for?".  As does                           
              Futures, the MMP will feature numerous positive examples of                    
              minorities and women whose professional success has resulted                   
              from their math skills.  The target grade levels are grades                    
              7-9, focusing on prealgebra mathematics instruction.
