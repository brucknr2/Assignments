Abstract    :
                This research involves computer architecture, compilation, and               
              operating systems work focused on broad application of massively               
              parallel computing.  The approach is to identify minimal architectural         
              changes and aggressively push compilation techniques to handle                 
              asynchronous communication and scheduling for parallel languages.              
              Current demonstration of methods include compilation of Id90 for               
              conventional architectures plus active messages.
