Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              A series of workshops for 20 middle schools teachers each                      
              will be offered, one per semester over the next 2 academic                     
              years.  The topics covered will be Acoustics, Optics,                          
              Electricity and Newton's Laws.  Participants will be given a                   
              collection of experimental apparatus together with a manual                    
              with a detailed discussion of the series of experiments that                   
              can be performed with the apparatus.                                           
                                                                                             
              Emphasis in the workshop will be on the study of physics                       
              through experimentation using the techniques of prediction,                    
              experimentation and observation discussion and concept                         
              formation and modelling these teaching techniques which                        
              teachers can use in their classrooms.                                          
                                                                                             
              Follow up activities will include a physics demonstration                      
              program to be given co-operatively by the workshop director                    
              and the participating teacher for the students in the                          
              schools.                                                                       
                                                                                             
              Cost sharing is 31%.
