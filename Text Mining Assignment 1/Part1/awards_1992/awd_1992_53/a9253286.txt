Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                                                                                            
              This three year project, sponsored by Montana State                            
              University, will provide an opportunity for 150 teachers,                      
              through an on-line computer network, to take six courses                       
              selected from a prior successful NSF program.  These courses                   
              have been revised to conform to the requirements of the new                    
              delivery.  Each year the course will be revised to increase                    
              its effectiveness.  Teachers will be provided a text, a                        
              study guide and a bit of materials for hands-on activities.                    
              The final evaluation of the program will study the                             
              effectiveness of this approach in the development of teacher                   
              knowledge and the changes made in the classrooms and compare                   
              with on-site teacher enhancement programs.  The matching                       
              fund provided by the University can constitute 15% of the                      
              NSF award.
