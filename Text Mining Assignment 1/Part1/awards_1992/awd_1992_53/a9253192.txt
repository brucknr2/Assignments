Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This three-year project will be conducted through tribally-owned               
              Little Big Horn College and on-site at the Crow and Northern                   
              Cheyenne Reservations in Montana.  It is designed to provide                   
              quality training for elementary teachers in the content areas of               
              science and in the discovery method of teaching science.  Project              
              staff will work directly with the elementary teachers in the                   
              classrooms to implement the discovery approach.  Summer institutes             
              will be held for residential training in field-based science,                  
              providing opportunities to incorporate the traditional relationship            
              of the peple to the land.                                                      
                                                                                             
              This proposal is appropriate for teacher enhancement because it                
              targets teachers of Native Americans in Reservation schools, and is            
              designed to enhance the science knowledge and teaching and to                  
              develop leadership skills of these teachers.                                   
                                                                                             
              Non-NSF cost-sharing is approximately 18% of the amount requested              
              from NSF.
