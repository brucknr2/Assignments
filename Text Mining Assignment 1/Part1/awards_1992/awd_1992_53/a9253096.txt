Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This planning proposal seeks to enhance the use of                             
              technology in the science and mathematics classroom.  More                     
              specifically, the project seeks to do the following:  to                       
              examine how and which technological innovations are being                      
              used in the teaching of science and mathematics; to examine                    
              how technology is being used to link scientists, science and                   
              mathematics educators, and other professionals together; to                    
              determine what has worked, how well and why; and to explore                    
              new advances in technology that have implications for                          
              education.  As a result of the findings, a teacher                             
              enhancement program will be designed for grades K-12 for                       
              effective use of technology in the teaching of science and                     
              mathematics.
