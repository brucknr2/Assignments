Abstract    :
              This project outlines a plan to enhance the Environmental Science              
              Program at Alabama A&M University under the aegis of an                        
              interdisciplinary Center of Environmental Research and Training                
              (CERT).  Emphasis will be given to research addressing several water           
              quality issues coupled with special emphasis on a mechanism                    
              proposed to increase entry of minority undergraduate students in               
              environmental science specializations.  In attempt to achieve these            
              goals, four objectives ar presented.  Objective 1 focuses on toxic             
              heavy metals interaction with mineral surfaces.  Mechanisms of toxic           
              metals interactions with soil and pure clay mineral surfaces                   
              (sorption/desorption/precipitation) as affected by inorganic anion will        
              be investigated in tandem.  Objective 2 deals with research on soil            
              property effects on volatile organic compound migration in the vadose          
              zone.  Here, the impact of selected soil properties on the migration of        
              two common volatile organic contaminants will be investigated.                 
              Objective 3 proposes research on soil physical, chemical and                   
              hydrologic properties effects on organic contaminant transport in the          
              vadose zone.  the downward movement of pesticide as influenced by              
              macropores will be evaluated using field data and modeling.  Finally,          
              objective 4 presents a method to facilitate the entry of minority              
              students in the environmental sciences.  Special emphasis is placed            
              on the entry of undergraduate students in environmental science.
