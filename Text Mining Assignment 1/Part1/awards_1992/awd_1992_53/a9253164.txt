Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This three year project sponsored by Eastern Illinois                          
              University will provide 25 teachers of high school                             
              psychology a four-week summer program to acquaint them with                    
              the use of hands-on modules for use in demonstrations and                      
              experiments illustrating the scientific aspects of                             
              psychology.  In the first year well-prepared teachers will                     
              learn about the modules, use them in the schools and revise                    
              them as needed.  The revised modules will be evaluated by an                   
              outside evaluator and/or used in the second year with a                        
              less-well-prepared group of teachers.  In the third year the                   
              implementation and dissemination phase of the project will                     
              take place.  Matching funds from the school and the                            
              University constitute 14% of the NSF award.
