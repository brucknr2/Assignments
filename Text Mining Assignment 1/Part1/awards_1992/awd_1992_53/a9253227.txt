Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The University of Utah is offering a two-year program which creates            
              a partnership with Washington Elementary School and the                        
              university's Institute for the Theory and Application of Geometry              
              to establish Washington Elementary as a model for teacher-driven               
              reform in elementary mathematics education.  The project includes              
              an outreach component to satellite schools.  The program includes              
              two four-week summer workshops on mathematics content, exemplary               
              materials and teaching methodologies, followed by implementation               
              programs during the school year.                                               
                                                                                             
              The university and the school district will provide a cost share of            
              22% of the grant.
