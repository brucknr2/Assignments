Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This project will continue training teachers at the University of              
              Illinois at Chicago and will begin the training of teachers at two             
              other sites -- the University of Wisconsin-Parkside and DePaul                 
              University.  Training will consist of intensive summer workshops on            
              student-centered methods for teaching, such as using cooperative               
              learning using innovative problem-solving/applications-oriented                
              materials.  The teachers will gain experience using the materials              
              in the summer by teaching groups of high school students taking                
              summer courses.                                                                
                                                                                             
              Each teacher will implement the materials in a double-period class             
              of first-year integrated high school mathematics during the                    
              following school year for the same students that attended the                  
              summer course.  There will be support seminars during this school              
              year to support the teachers, as well as in-class observation by               
              project staff.  This support will continue for two more summers and            
              school years, with the teachers teaching second- and third-year                
              high school mathematics those years to the same students.                      
                                                                                             
              In a total of five high schools spread among the three centers, the            
              Interactive Mathematics Project materials will be implemented by               
              the teachers supported by this project.                                        
                                                                                             
              A comprehensive evaluation plan will track student performance and             
              retention of teachers from this project.
