Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This project seeks to integrate real-world applications and                    
              mathematical modeling into the secondary mathematics                           
              curriculum.  To these ends, 30 well-prepared high school                       
              mathematics teachers from around the State of New York will                    
              participate in two successive summer, residential four-week                    
              institutes to be held at SUNY in Brockton.  In these                           
              institutes participates will: (1) survey and examine                           
              available, exemplary classroom materials on applications and                   
              modeling; (2) study the underlying mathematical ideas and                      
              principles; (3) learn directly from industrial users of                        
              mathematics; and (4) explore appropriate uses of graphing                      
              calculators and microcomputers.  Participants will be chosen                   
              in five "teams" of six -- each team representing a region of                   
              New York State.  During the first summer -- in addition to                     
              their academic studies -- these teams of teachers will also                    
              prepare their own lessons and units involving applications                     
              and modeling, which they will pilot in their own classrooms                    
              during the succeeding academic year.  The institutes will                      
              also include sessions on staff development to help prepare                     
              the participating teachers to conduct in-service workshops                     
              in their local schools and, in the second academic year,                       
              throughout their respective regions.  Support by project                       
              staff for all these activities will include at least two                       
              site visits to each teacher's classroom, as well as to                         
              periodic regional meetings of the teams.  Cost sharing                         
              represents 58% of the total NSF contribution.
