Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This three year project, sponsored by the University of                        
              Illinois at Urbana-Champagne, will provide a four week                         
              workshop each year for 25 high school teachers.  The workshops                 
              will consist of lectures, demonstrations and hands-on                          
              laboratories on topics in technology, such as solar cells,                     
              superconductors and cement.  Both university faculty and                       
              industry personnel will conduct the workshops.  The modules                    
              will then be tested on high schools, after evaluation, and                     
              modified if necessary.  The modules considered to be the most                  
              successful will be punished and disseminated nationally.  The                  
              matching funds from the schools and the university constitute                  
              about 17% of the NSF award.
