Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This award will provide partial support for the 24th                           
              International Chemistry Olympiad (IChO) to be held in the                      
              United States, July 11-22, 1992.  The IChO originated in 1968                  
              with participants from Czechoslovakia, Poland and Hungary; the                 
              United States first sent a team in 1984.  This is the first                    
              time the Olympiad has been hosted by the United States.  The                   
              competition brings together the world's top high school-age                    
              chemistry students.  Students take a five-hour theoretical                     
              examination and a five-hour laboratory practical examination.                  
              Between test days, and while the exams are being graded,                       
              students have the opportunity to tour the host country and                     
              interact with their peers from other nations.                                  
                                                                                             
              Delegations consisting of four students and two adult mentors                  
              from each of 35 countries have been invited to participate in                  
              the 12-day event which will be held in Pittsburgh,                             
              Pennsylvania and Washington, D.C.  Other supporters of the                     
              project are the American Chemical Society and the U.S.                         
              chemical industry.
