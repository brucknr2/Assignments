Abstract    :
              This Minority Research Planning Grant will enable Dr. Leslie                   
              Jimenez to intiate a research program studying azobenzene and                  
              anthracene cyclophanes as potential photo driven on-off                        
              switches. The work will consist of the synthesis of cyclophane                 
              host molecules containing photosensitive functional groups. It                 
              will also involve determining the association constants and                    
              free energies of compelxation of the two photoisomeric forms of                
              each host with various positively charged guest molecules. The                 
              objective of the work is to develop a host that will form                      
              strong complexes with guests when in one state but not when it                 
              is in the other.                                                               
              %%%                                                                            
              Support from this program will enable Dr. Jimenez to establish                 
              a research program studying molecules which have the ability to                
              interact strongly with certain other species when in one                       
              photochemical state but weakly when in the other state. Such                   
              work can have major significance to the development of                         
              microelectronic circuits.
