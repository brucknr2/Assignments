Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The Maui Economic Development Board, in collaboration with the                 
              school district administration of Maui, Hawaii, has designed                   
              a four-year project to revamp the teaching of science in the                   
              district's 17 elementary schools.  A total of 320 teachers                     
              will each receive 13 days of professional development, during                  
              which they would become familiar with four hands-on inquiry                    
              based instructional kits for their grade level, as well as                     
              relevant teaching strategies and background content knowledge.                 
              A science materials resource center will be established by a                   
              local company, and then spun off as a small independent                        
              business.  The Maui Chamber of Commerce, the Maui Economic                     
              Development Board, Cal Tech, and local industry have committed                 
              financial support to the project, as well as commitment of                     
              effort by local scientists.  The instructional material and                    
              teacher training model would be a replicate of the successful                  
              NSF-funded Project SEED (Science for Early Educational                         
              Development), a collaborative reform effort by the California                  
              Institute of Technology and the Pasadena Unified School                        
              District.                                                                      
                                                                                             
              The proposed dissemination of Project SEED from Pasadena to                    
              Maui will take a successful NSF-funded project and implement                   
              it in a community with genuine need.  The proposed effort will                 
              replace the district's current elementary science curriculum                   
              with an exemplary inquiry-driven hands on approach.  This                      
              project represents a model partnership between the school                      
              district and the local business community, and builds on a                     
              locally funded pilot project in one school.                                    
                                                                                             
              Cost sharing on this project represents 334% of the NSF                        
              contribution.
