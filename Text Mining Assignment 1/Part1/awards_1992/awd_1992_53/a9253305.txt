Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                                                                                             
                                                                                            
              The California Institute of Technology will develop and                        
              deliver through a collaborative effort by scientists, teacher-                 
              educators, and master teachers, a one-semester course for the                  
              elementary teacher education program.  Future elementary                       
              teachers will construct their own science knowledge and work                   
              cooperatively in a "hands on" science classroom environment.                   
              These prospective teachers will do challenging investigations                  
              with sophisticated tools while modeling good science teaching.                 
              Simultaneously, the course will provide a solid foundation in                  
              fundamental principles of biology, chemistry, physics and                      
              earth science.  The course will be integrated into the                         
              elementary science teacher program.
