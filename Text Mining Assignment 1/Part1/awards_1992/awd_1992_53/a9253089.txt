Abstract    :
              This project will provide funds for the expanded dissemination of              
              innovative developments in engineering curricula by increasing                 
              publicity activities and providing travel grants to principal                  
              investigators on 17 NSF sponsored projects who will present their              
              results in special sessions of the Frontiers in Education                      
              conference.  The conference has become one of the premier vehicles             
              for the communication of new methodologies in engineering education            
              and the project will accelerate the dissemination of new results               
              and also increase awareness of the NSF programs devoted to course              
              and curriculum to curriculum development.
