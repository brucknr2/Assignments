Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This project will train K-12 educators in Wisconsin, from                      
              August 1, 1992 through July 30, 1995, to incorporate                           
              environmental education into all areas of the curriculum.                      
              This will be done by having twenty-five environmental                          
              educators offer 30 courses per year in locations throughout                    
              the state.  This program will also initiate a Master's                         
              degree in environmental education at the University of                         
              Wisconsin at Stevens Point that will provide 50 teachers the                   
              opportunity to become leaders in environmental education.                      
              There is an approximate cost-share of 15%.
