Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              We proposed to develop a comprehensive academic support program in             
              mathematics for minority undergraduate students at Stony Brook.                
              The program will have two major aims:                                          
                                                                                             
              1.   Create special workshops for freshman calculus to enable                  
                   minority students studying calculus to develop confidence in              
                   their mathematical problem-solving skills and gain analytical             
                   insights to launch them successfully into major in                        
                   mathematics, science and engineering.                                     
                                                                                             
              2.   Attracts more minority students into majors in mathematics,               
                   and offer these students a program of academic support and                
                   independent projects that will prepare them to enter graduate             
                   programs in the mathematical sciences.
