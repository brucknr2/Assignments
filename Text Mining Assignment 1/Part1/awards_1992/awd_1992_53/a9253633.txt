Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Funded under the new Presidential Faculty Fellow program                       
              (PFF), research and teaching will be supplemented in the area                  
              of fluid dynamics related to biomedical systems.  The research                 
              is experimental, and is focused on particle tracking in                        
              branching and curved tubes.                                                    
                                                                                             
              The research is applicable to flow through large blood                         
              vessels, and other arterial flows.
