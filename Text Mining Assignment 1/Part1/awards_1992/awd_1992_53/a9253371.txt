Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Zoos have the opportunity to reach a large audience and to                     
              improve public understanding of biological principles.  Zoos can               
              go beyond creating an appreciation for nature by actively                      
              encouraging their visitors to apply these principles and take                  
              action on behalf of the environment.                                           
                                                                                             
              Tropic World:  A Primate's View will improve the interpretation                
              of an existing exhibit at Brookfield Zoo by encouraging visitors               
              to experience a tropical rainforest from a non-human primate's                 
              perspective.  Visitors will be challenged, by interactive forms                
              of interpretation, to explore the similarities and differences                 
              between themselves and other primates.  This experience will                   
              provide a framework for visitors to consider their own                         
              relationship with their environment.                                           
                                                                                             
              The project objectives are:                                                    
                                                                                             
              1.  To improve public understanding that , like all organisms,                 
                   primates use and depend on their environment.  However,                   
                   humans ar the only primate species that can choose how they               
                  impact their environment over extended time and space.                     
                                                                                             
              2.  to motivate people to act on behalf of the natural world                   
                  through conservation.                                                      
                                                                                             
              3.  To contribute to the body of knowledge of how informal                     
                  education affects people's knowledge of natural science                    
                  topics, as well as the behavior of people in relation to                   
                conservation issues.
