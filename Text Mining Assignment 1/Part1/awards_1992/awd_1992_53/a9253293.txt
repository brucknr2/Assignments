Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This program expands upon the "Chemistry in Motion" project.                   
              The plan is to include biology and the life sciences and                       
              extend the training to include pre-high school teachers and                    
              additional territories.                                                        
                                                                                             
              The broad goal is to provide training and support for about                    
              120 chemistry teachers, 80 biology teachers and 40                             
              middle/junior high school teachers among a network of 45 to                    
              50 school districts in two multi county regions of                             
              Pennsylvania.                                                                  
                                                                                             
              A series of 2-week summer workshops will update knowledge                      
              content in biology or chemistry and give teachers the                          
              pertinent theory and practical use of modern science                           
              instrumentation. Teachers typically attend the summer                          
              workshops for a minimum of 3 years.  As teachers become more                   
              capable the emphasis shifts to focus on developing                             
              laboratory materials and exercises appropriate for use in                      
              school classrooms and labs.  The introduction of outcomes                      
              based education in Pennsylvania will allow teachers more                       
              freedom to write their own curriculum.                                         
                                                                                             
              Participating schools are visited by the science van                           
              bringing instruments to the school 12-15 times per year. A                     
              certified biology/chemistry teacher drives the van and acts                    
              as a resource for teachers. Additional follow up includes                      
              special 1 day seminars, an annual science fair and the                         
              development of an active network of science teachers.                          
                                                                                             
              Cost sharing amounts to 81%.
