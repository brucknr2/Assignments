Abstract    :
                   The principal investigator will investigate the propagation               
              of singularities for semilinear strictly hyperbolic systems with               
              piecewise smooth initial data.  This has applications in                       
              computatonal aerodynamics.                                                     
                   Computational fluid dynamics can give very detailed                       
              information about complex physical phenomena.  The rate of                     
              convergence of numerical schemes is useful in determining how                  
              accurate the information is.
