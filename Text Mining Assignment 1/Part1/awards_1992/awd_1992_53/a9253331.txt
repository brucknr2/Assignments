Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The grant funds a 4 year project to disseminate nationally the                 
              materials and techniques developed at the University of                        
              Arizona for image enhancement.  These materials allow students                 
              and teachers to scan images, or select one of thousands                        
              already available, and do enhancement and analysis.  The                       
              images are drawn from many fields and support exploration and                  
              discovery related to all area of science as well as many areas                 
              of mathematics.                                                                
                                                                                             
              The Image Processing for Teaching project develops a                           
              curriculum for inservice workshops for teachers in grades 5                    
              through 12.  Multimedia materials on CD-ROM accompanied by                     
              video and print materials support the sites that adopt the                     
              technology.  A national structure will disseminate the                         
              materials and promote further development of applications by                   
              teachers and students.  An initial core group of 90 expert                     
              teachers will participate in the dissemination and training.                   
              The grant includes funds to support 80 teachers per year from                  
              either districts that cannot afford the workshops or those                     
              that teach targeted underrepresented groups.
