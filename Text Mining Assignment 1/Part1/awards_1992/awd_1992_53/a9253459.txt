Abstract    :
              Both education and training, as conventionally practiced, fail to              
              provide many individuals with the level of understanding and                   
              skills needed to become productive contributors in a world of                  
              fast-changing technology.  This project explores the concept of                
              mentoring as an alternative instructional tool that can bridge                 
              the gap between the concepts stressed in formal education and the              
              competencies required by the workplace.  We view mentoring as a                
              dynamic social and instructional process initiated when a learner              
              detects a problem in the context of some activity.  In the first               
              phase of the project, we will study informal mentoring in the                  
              workplace and more structured mentoring in educational settings.               
              We will also initiate laboratory studies, using the first                      
              prototype of a computer-based support system that enables two                  
              individuals to work on the same application with provisions for                
              a multimedia dialogue between participants.  This work will                    
              provide the basis for developing a cognitive model of the                      
              mentoring process.  That model and the Phase 1 research results                
              will inform the design of the Distant Mentor, refinement of the                
              initial prototype that will provide not only multimedia                        
              communication for networked collaboration but also support for                 
              specific mentoring activities as reviewing problem solving                     
              histories and generating explanations.
