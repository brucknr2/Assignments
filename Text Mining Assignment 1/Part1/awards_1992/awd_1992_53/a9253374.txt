Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This project will produce and evaluate a pilot program with                    
              supplementary print material for a half-hour science radio                     
              series for Children.  The series will target children 8 to 10                  
              years old, but will be designed to include the entire family.                  
              Each program will consist of educational songs, interviews,                    
              stories, call-in questions and "hands-on" experiments.  The                    
              support material will provide additional science activities that               
              may appropriately be conducted in the home and in classrooms.                  
              The budget for this pilot phase is $266,521 of which $215,940 is               
              being provided by the NSF.                                                     
                                                                                             
              The full series, once produced, is planned to be broadcast                     
              through the Children's Radio Network.  The AAAS will be                        
              responsible for development and management of the outreach                     
              component of the project.//
