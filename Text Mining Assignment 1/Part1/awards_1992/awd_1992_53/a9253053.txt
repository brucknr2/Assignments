Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The present proposal outlines a strategy for                                   
              the recruitment and long-term guidance of                                      
              promising minority undergraduate students                                      
              interested in pursuing advanced degrees in the                                 
              natural sciences.  Our primary goal is to                                      
              provide opportunities to meritorious                                           
              undergraduates for "hands-on" research                                         
              experience in areas of the natural sciences                                    
              wherein faculty members at the University of                                   
              Guam continue to demonstrate reputable                                         
              expertise, i.e., marine chemistry, coral reef                                  
              ecology reproductive physiology, systematic,                                   
              biogeography, environmental biology,                                           
              geological oceanography, and marine                                            
              biogeochemistry.  The proposed enrichment                                      
              program will match faculty members with                                        
              students expressing interest in specific                                       
              research programs. In addition to training in                                  
              basic and specialized research techniques,                                     
              students will receive counseling with regard                                   
              to coursework, career orientation, methods for                                 
              scientific publication and presentation,                                       
              selection of optimal graduate programs, and                                    
              preparation of application materials for                                       
              graduate schools.
