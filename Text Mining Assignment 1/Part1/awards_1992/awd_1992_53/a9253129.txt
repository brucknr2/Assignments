Abstract    :
                   This research planning grant will enable the researcher to                
              continue her investigation into the relationship between                       
              permutation representations and the trace form in number fields.               
              The idea is to study how the trace form varies in a family of                  
              Galois extensions of number fields.                                            
                   This is research in the field of number theory.   Number                  
              theory starts with the whole numbers and questions such as the                 
              divisibility of one whole number by another.  It is among the                  
              oldest fields of mathematics and it was originally pursued for                 
              purely aesthetic reasons.  However, within the last half century,              
              it has become an essential tool in developing new algorithms for               
              computer science and new error correcting codes for electronics.
