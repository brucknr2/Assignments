Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              We propose to develop conceptual frameworks, system                            
              architectures, and domain-oriented knowledge-based design                      
              environments in support of learning on demand.  Our approach                   
              will exploit the power of high-functionality computer                          
              systems in a project-oriented learning environment for                         
              under-graduate students (in computer science as well as in                     
              other related disciplines).  We will place special emphasis                    
              on integrating working and learning and on supporting self-                    
              directed and group learning; we will study and evaluate                        
              these issues in a naturalistic setting.
