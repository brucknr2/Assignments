Abstract    :
                    The proposed project involves interdisciplinary, comparative             
              research on the effects of public policies on the informal economic            
              sector.  A collaborative faculty-student team will generate data on            
              informal economic participants, their work, and its returns in six             
              matched neighborhoods of Juarez and El Paso.  Interviews will also             
              be conducted with policymakers to clarify how policies are                     
              formulated and implemented on the informal economic sector.                    
              Existing data from censuses and other data sets will expand findings           
              from this study.  This research will advance knowledge about state-            
              society relations on an international border now experiencing change           
              associated with free trade.  The research will also be relevant for            
              the policy implications that flow therefrom.
