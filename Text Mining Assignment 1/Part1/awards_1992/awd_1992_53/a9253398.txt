Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The Science Museum of Minnesota (SMM) will develop an                          
              interdisciplinary national traveling exhibition about raptors                  
              (birds of prey).  Created in collaboration with The Raptor                     
              Center at the University of Minnesota (TRC) and the Museum                     
              Magnet School of the St. Paul School District, this exhibit and                
              its related programs will explore themes of biodiversity,                      
              ecology, and human relationships with the natural world.  It                   
              will help visitors understand raptors as diverse, charismatic,                 
              biologically-complex animals whose continued survival is linked                
              to fundamental questions of public policy, economics, and                      
              environmental ethics.  combining the perspectives of the                       
              sciences with those of the humanities, the exhibit will present                
              science in a real-world context of human values and actions.                   
                                                                                             
              Opening at SMM in the summer of 1944, the 5,000-square-foot                    
              exhibit will travel for five years or more to other large                      
              museums, nature centers, and zoos throughout the U.S.  Using                   
              specimens, models, artifacts, dioramas, audiovisual programs,                  
              and interactive components and supported by theater,                           
              demonstrations, and a variety of other on-site programs, it will               
              provide a compelling mix of informal learning experiences for                  
              families, school groups, and other general audiences.  Beyond                  
              the museum walls, the themes of the project will reach schools                 
              and other important outreach audiences through videotapes,                     
              teacher training programs, educational materials, and other                    
              programs.  SMM will also produce a scaled-down version of the                  
              exhibit that will tour to smaller museums, nature centers, and                 
              zoos.
