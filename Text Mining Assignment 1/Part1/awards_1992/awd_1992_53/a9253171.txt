Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              A seven day workshop is proposed for 24 high school science                    
              (biology, chemistry and physics) and mathematics teachers                      
              from across the nation.  The teachers will experience first                    
              hand an unusual systematic instructional strategy which                        
              employs open ended problem solving techniques.                                 
                                                                                             
              During the first three days the participants work in                           
              interdisciplinary teams of four to devise a product that                       
              addresses a problem or need in an assigned field e.g safety                    
              or energy conservation.  Workshop participants are                             
              encouraged to call upon companies as they develop their                        
              solution and  are encouraged to consider how to capitalize                     
              on the industrial interests and talent available.  In                          
              addition a key test of a team's solution to a problem is                       
              found in the presentation to a review board.                                   
                                                                                             
              The second half of the workshop participants are teamed with                   
              other teachers from the same discipline.  The task is again                    
              problem solving with teachers working to develop curricular                    
              modules for use in their high school classrooms which                          
              incorporate the problem solving techniques they have                           
              learned.                                                                       
                                                                                             
              Each teacher who participates will present at least one in-                    
              service program in their home district during the year                         
              following their participation in the workshop.                                 
                                                                                             
              The program is for four years with four teachers from the                      
              previous year returning to the workshop to serve as "master                    
              teachers".  These teaching assistants will develop a manual                    
              for dissemination and use in future workshops.                                 
                                                                                             
              Cost sharing is 4%.
