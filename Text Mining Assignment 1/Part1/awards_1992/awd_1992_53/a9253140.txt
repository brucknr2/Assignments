Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This activity aims at a systemic examination of the                            
              educational, technological and financial terrain that                          
              extends beyond the present very modest frontier of                             
              educational telecommunication activities by schools to over-                   
              the-horizon network applications.  It aims at affecting NREN                   
              planning and experimentation, which should, in turn, produce                   
              data on costs, educational benefits and demand that can                        
              affect public and private sector investment decisions.  It                     
              aims too at developing an initial consensus among educators                    
              on the role of wideband network applications that goes                         
              beyond the technologically and educationally modest                            
              experimentation presently visible.                                             
                                                                                             
              Project outcomes include three documents.  The principal                       
              document of some 50 to 60 pages includes a suite of                            
              experimental designs and a summary assessment of their                         
              educational potential by educational policy and decision                       
              makers.  Three designs, more and less educationally radical,                   
              technologically advanced and financially expensive are aimed                   
              at improving science and mathematics education; and                            
              structuring new options for school reform.  A shorter                          
              secondary document describes educational needs for group                       
              software products, information services and educational                        
              databases.  A final document describes some options for                        
              allocating costs and for financing educational use of local                    
              and wide-area network applications.                                            
                                                                                             
              Dissemination is planned in both print and conference                          
              formats.
