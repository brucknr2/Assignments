Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              An invitational, three day conference will be held at the                      
              Cheyenne Mountain Conference Center in Colorado Springs on                     
              April 1-3, 1992 to examine the present status of CD-ROMS.                      
              Issues to be addressed include rights, permissions and                         
              royalties; conversion from print to magnetic format;                           
              software/user interface; and interactions with the CD-ROM                      
              industry.  The conference will publish a conference report                     
              which can serve as an introduction to CD-ROM and its                           
              potential for use in education.  The conference will also                      
              attempt to develop common features in CD-ROMS for education                    
              to make the medium easier for teachers to use.  A group of                     
              educators will be organized to interact with representatives                   
              of CD-ROM industries to encourage effective use of CD-ROMS                     
              in education.  The participants will include representatives                   
              from major EHR funded CD-ROM projects, representatives from                    
              industries and researchers in the field of CD-ROM                              
              development, and representatives from the NSF and the                          
              Department of Education.
