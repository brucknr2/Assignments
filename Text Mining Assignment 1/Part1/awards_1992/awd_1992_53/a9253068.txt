Abstract    :
                   The proposed research will investigate the policy contexts and            
              organizational structures within schools that influence mathematics            
              and science teaching, and in turn, student learning.  National                 
              goals for science and mathematics education call for major                     
              improvements in the level of student understanding and problem                 
              solving ability.  Two strategies for achieving these goals, as                 
              envisioned by many, are local school redesign and national student             
              assessments.  The proposed research will help fill important gaps              
              in the knowledge required to advance these strategies toward                   
              improved math and science teaching in secondary schools.                       
                                                                                             
              There are two components of the research.  The first, analyzes                 
              context effects on teaching and corrects a bias in prior studies of            
              educational effectiveness in favor of the school as the sole unit              
              of analysis.  The other component seeks to improve upon the NEL:88             
              program for assessing desired learning outcomes, especially in                 
              relation to teacher context effects on student understanding.  This            
              component will develop subscales for NELS tests that help                      
              distinguish teaching effects on different kinds of student                     
              learning.  Together these components, which build on prior work of             
              the researcher, promise new knowledge and recommended strategies to            
              support systemic reform of U.S. science and mathematics education.
