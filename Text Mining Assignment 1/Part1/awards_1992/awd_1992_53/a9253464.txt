Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The Internet telecommunications network is a resource that                     
              has begun to be utilized in many arenas, yet has a potential                   
              for K-12 learning that is unexplored and unstudied.  As a                      
              component of the Boulder Valley Project, a school                              
              district/university/industry partnership which is deploying                    
              Internet connectivity to an entire school district, Kids as                    
              Global Scientists will couple the implementation of Internet                   
              technology with detailed research on student learning,                         
              collaboration models, and interface design for a K-12                          
              audience.  In particular, the project will contribute: 1)                      
              Insights into the study of seventh graders' understanding of                   
              atmospheric science concepts while investigating rich and                      
              dynamic representations of weather phenomena, 2) new models                    
              for communities and teacher interaction, and 3) prototype                      
              Internet interfaces for K-12 audiences.                                        
                                                                                             
              Internet connectivity within Middle School Internet                            
              Laboratories will allow classrooms of students to collect                      
              and interpret National Weather Service data and satellite                      
              images of an extensive variety of weather phenomena.                           
              Telecommunications within the District will support vertical                   
              curricular themes, teleapprenticeships, and new models of                      
              proximal and virtual communities.  Extensive work with                         
              teachers-as-project-members will expand current models of                      
              teachers-as-researchers/learners/curriculum developers.                        
              Middle school students will be Global Scientists both in                       
              their extensive study of North American and world weather,                     
              and in their ability to communicate and personalize weather                    
              phenomena with scientists of all ages, both locally and                        
              world-wide.
