Abstract    :
              This is a 1992 Presidential Faculty Fellow                                     
              Award (PFF).  The optical and electronic                                       
              properties of compound semiconductors and                                      
              their respective heterostructure systems are                                   
              crucial for future high speed electronic                                       
              optoelectronic, light-emitting display, and solar                              
              energy conversation applications.  In order to                                 
              exploit these properties fully, the five year                                  
              research effort will be concentrated in two                                    
              general areas of interest, namely, epitaxial                                   
              crystal growth and basic materials properties                                  
              of ternary alloys and heterostructures that                                    
              contain combinations of the Column III                                         
              elements Al, Ga, and In, and a single Column                                   
              V element P, As, or Sb, and the device                                         
              physics of vertical cavity quantum well lasers,                                
              modulators, switches, and optical interconnects.
