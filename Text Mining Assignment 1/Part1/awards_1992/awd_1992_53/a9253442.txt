Abstract    :
              The Women in Engineering, Science and Technology Program (WEST) at             
              the New Jersey Institute of Technology is increasing the number of             
              women who transfer to baccalaureate programs after receiving the AS            
              degrees from New Jersey community colleges.  WEST has discovered               
              that investing in faculty mentors of math-able women is a long-term            
              solution to the gender pipeline problem.  It is currently                      
              developing a model faculty mentoring program for six community                 
              colleges.  In addition, WEST is presenting four career days for 400            
              students, and presenting a state-wide conference for 100 community             
              college faculty on the topic of "Gender, Engineering, Science and              
              Technology."  This conference will be videotaped and broadcast                 
              nationally on the Community College Satellite Network and                      
              regionally on the Cable Television Network as a program entitled               
              "She Wants To Be An Engineer."
