Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This project is a four year program to build a partnership                     
              between four school districts in Westmoreland County, PA,                      
              local industry, and Saint Vincent College, in support of                       
              mathematics and science education in the four districts.                       
              The project will consist of three components: 1)  10 day                       
              summer academies for 90 elementary teachers from the                           
              La Trobe School District (grades k-6), with school year                        
              follow-up support for implementation and evaluation of new                     
              mathematics and science activities developed during the                        
              academies;  2) the development of 24 teams (6 per                              
              participating school district) consisting of a junior or                       
              senior high school "lead or mentor" teacher, an industrial                     
              scientist and a college scientist.  The scientists will                        
              introduce the teachers to their work environments and will                     
              assist them in the development of appropriate hands-on                         
              classroom activities to improve their mathematics and                          
              science courses: and 3) three five day seminars for 18                         
              selected teachers to develop and implement an integrated                       
              mathematics-science capstone course for high school seniors                    
              in the four school districts.                                                  
                                                                                             
              Cost sharing equals 120.2% of the NSF award.
