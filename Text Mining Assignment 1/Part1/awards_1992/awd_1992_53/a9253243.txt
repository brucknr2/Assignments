Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The Supercomputing Teacher Enhancement Project (STEP) trains                   
              forty-six teachers in the San Diego area over a period of 42                   
              months. Six of the teachers are lead teachers who receive                      
              extensive training at the Lawrence Livermore Labs prior to the                 
              start of the project and at university expense.  They serve as                 
              teaching assistants working with the forty participating                       
              teachers over the following three years.  The participating                    
              teachers learn the basics of computational  science,                           
              programming, and high performance computing then are expected                  
              to share and work with approximately ten other teachers in                     
              their schools.  They learn to use computing at many levels, to                 
              incorporate computational science into their curriculum, and                   
              to develop activities or projects for students.  The teacher                   
              training consists of three week summer workshops, academic                     
              year meetings, and visits to local facilities.                                 
                                                                                             
              Through the combined efforts of the universities, the local                    
              school districts, the super computing center, and the                          
              community, the project will directly impact students in urban                  
              and similar schools in the San Diego area with a high number                   
              of minority students.  The project targets underrepresented                    
              teacher and teachers of students who are traditionally                         
              underrepresented.
