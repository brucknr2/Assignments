Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This three year project, sponsored by the Education                            
              Committee of the Mississippi section of the American                           
              Chemical Society and managed through the University of                         
              Southern Mississippi, will provide in-service training to                      
              all Mississippi high school chemistry teachers.  Fifteen                       
              topics will be developed, tested and then taught in a mini-                    
              workshop format.  Each module will be taught at eight places                   
              throughout the state and each year three modules will be                       
              covered.  The in-service program will be supported by a                        
              resource center, which will provide telephone support, a                       
              lending library and a newsletter.  More than 400 teachers                      
              will be served.  In the third year of the grant the program                    
              will be tested in West Virginia to assess the possibility of                   
              dissemination.  The grant is being matched by funds from the                   
              University and the school districts by an amount equal to                      
              44% of the NSF award.
