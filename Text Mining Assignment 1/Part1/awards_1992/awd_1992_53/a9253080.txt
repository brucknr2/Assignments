Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The purpose of this project is to collect examples of                          
              secondary school leaving exam questions regularly given to                     
              advanced science and mathematics students in 10 countries                      
              planning to enter higher education.  The exams will be                         
              analyzed to develop knowledge about the coverage of science                    
              and mathematics topics required of advanced students in other                  
              countries.  Science and mathematics topics will be classified                  
              into a framework to better inform those who are setting                        
              standards for science and mathematics students in the United                   
              States about policies of testing students in other developed                   
              countries.                                                                     
                                                                                             
              The analysis of the exam questions would be made within the                    
              basic framework of an ongoing international assessment of                      
              student achievement in science and mathematics - the Third                     
              International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS).  This                     
              study has developed a classification system of mathematics and                 
              science that would be used to examine the exam questions of                    
              other countries.
