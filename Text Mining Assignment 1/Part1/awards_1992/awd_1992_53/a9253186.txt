Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The University of Michigan is disseminating the Global                         
              Rivers Environmental Education Network (GREEN) project                         
              nationally.  Teams from five regions (southeast, northeast,                    
              southwest, northwest, and midwest) will be selected and                        
              trained to be leaders of Project GREEN.  These regional                        
              teams will be responsible for the recruitment and training                     
              of other middle and high school teacher teams in their area.                   
                                                                                             
              The project builds on previous work using watersheds to                        
              create a science/social science interdisciplinary course at                    
              the secondary level.  The project will begin August 1, 1992                    
              and continue to July 30, 1995.                                                 
                                                                                             
              Cost-share for the project is approximately 16%.
