Abstract    :
                    This unsolicited proposal from The Society for Advancement of            
              Chicano's and Native Americans (SACNAS) describes the 1992 San                 
              Antonio annual conference.  The SACNAS annual conferences are primarily        
              designed to stimulate the interest of underrepresented minority faculty        
              to continue careers in the sciences and for students to pursue                 
              doctorates in science and engineering.                                         
                    The conference has components that are designed to increase the          
              educational and professional opportunities for faculty and students such       
              as students sharing their research through poster sessions and faculty         
              presenting their research in culturally relevant issues.  These                
              conferences serve as an important mechanism to strengthen the national         
              support network of individuals and institutions interested in increasing       
              the representation of minorities in the sciences and engineering.              
                    The funding is requesting to support 78 students and faculty to          
              attend the 1992 conference and to participate in a planning conference         
              for a future symposium on engineering.  The invited faculty and students       
              complete for the few allocated slots available.
