Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The Science Museum of Connecticut (SMC) proposes a three-                      
              year exhibit project called The State of the Environment.                      
              This cost-effective project will serve over 500,000 citizens                   
              a year by producing two permanent exhibits - 2400 sf for SMC                   
              and 400 sf for SMD's Roaring Brook Nature Center -- and                        
              eight traveling exhibits for use primarily in connecticut's                    
              Priority schools.  These innovative exhibits use highly                        
              accurate sculptural relief maps which are animated by laser                    
              graphics and responsive to visitor inquiries through a                         
              research-calibre database containing vast information on                       
              Connecticut's environment.  Thorough evaluation will help                      
              SMC design visitor experiences that make map-database                          
              interaction attractive, easy to use and understand, and                        
              educationally satisfying.  State accredited teacher                            
              workshops will give educators a firm grasp of database                         
              capabilities prior to its use in the traveling exhibits for                    
              schools.  Traveling exhibits will support goals in                             
              Connecticut's NSF-funded Statewide Initiative.  Teacher's                      
              Guides will facilitate in-dept investigations for high                         
              school science lessons.  These exhibits will provide hands-                    
              on experiences with professional tools for environmental                       
              research, show how environmental maps are made, teach basic                    
              principles of environmental science, and provide-in-depth                      
              information about the ecology of an entire state.
