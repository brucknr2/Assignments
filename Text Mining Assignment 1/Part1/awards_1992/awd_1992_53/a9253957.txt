Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              As part of the efforts of a number of researchers to address the               
              problem of underrepresentation of women and minorities at the                  
              doctoral level in science and mathematics, this investigator will              
              test a model of determinants of PhD completion by analyzing by                 
              logistic regression methods data on PhD completion possessed by the            
              National Research Council that can be linked to the records of                 
              those applying to the NSF's Graduate Fellowship Program up to about            
              1981.  Variables such as completion or noncompletion of the PhD and            
              time taken to completion will be related to factors such as                    
              individual and demographic characteristics, academic background,               
              field of science, and market characteristics for PhD hiring in and             
              outside of academia.  The effects of receiving and not receiving a             
              GFP award per se will be estimated.  The analysis of this highly               
              select group -- those applying to the GFP -- will bring previous               
              work by other investigators by tracing PhD completion up to the                
              mid- to late 1980s.
