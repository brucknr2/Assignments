Abstract    :
              9253114  Bottomley       The principal investigator (PI) will study the
              correlation  present in the packet interarrival process associate with high 
              speed networks.  Since this is a planning grant, the PI will  continue her
              review of the literature, attend one or more  conferences in the area, select a
              network for measurement, and  begin research.  The outcome of the planning
              grant will be a  proposal to be submitted to the National Science Foundation.
