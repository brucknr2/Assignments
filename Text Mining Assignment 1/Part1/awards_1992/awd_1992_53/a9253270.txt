Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This proposal seeks to enhance the scientific skills of                        
              middle school science teachers in New York City.  In                           
              cooperation with New York Community School Districts 5, 8,                     
              9, 11, 29, and 32 the City College of New York CUNY proposes                   
              the Aerospace Space Leadership Institute.  The program is                      
              for three years and focuses on the training of 48 certified                    
              middle school science teachers (grades 5-8) to become peer                     
              leaders in their districts.  Using resources from Learning                     
              Link, the NASA Resource Center at City College, the Intrepid                   
              Air and Space Museum, and the Young Astronaut Program, the                     
              college will provide participants with content, technology,                    
              and leadership skills which will enable them to become                         
              effective educators of teachers equipped to help their                         
              colleagues integrate science and technology in their                           
              classrooms.  Opportunities will be provided for the                            
              development of aerospace science and interdisciplinary                         
              curriculum projects that will be shared on the Learning Link                   
              electronic network.                                                            
                                                                                             
              Cost sharing is equivalent to 37% of the NSF award.
