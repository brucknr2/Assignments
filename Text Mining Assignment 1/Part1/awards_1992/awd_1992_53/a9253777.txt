Abstract    :
              This is a Presidential Faculty Fellows award.  The research involves           
              theoretical analyses and experimentation in  three interrelated areas          
              of acoustics and nonlinear dynamics.  These are: (a) the interaction           
              of sound and structures; (b) acoustic transducer development; (c) and          
              high-tensity acoustics.                                                        
                                                                                             
              A Nonlinear Dynamics Laboratory will be established at the                     
              university for educational and research activities.
