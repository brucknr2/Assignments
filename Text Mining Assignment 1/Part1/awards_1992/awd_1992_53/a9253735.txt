Abstract    :
              Law         This multidisciplinary research focuses on the development  of
              silicon models for point defect behavior, which are vital to  understanding
              dopant diffusion.  Models are being developed and  parameterized for the effect
              of silicidation and stress on point  defect kinetics.  These models are then
              implemented in SUPREM-IV,  a standard integrated circuit process modeling tool
              that utilizes  advanced finite element techniques.  This is a Presidential
              Faculty Fellow (PFF) Award initially  awarded in Fiscal Year 1992.
