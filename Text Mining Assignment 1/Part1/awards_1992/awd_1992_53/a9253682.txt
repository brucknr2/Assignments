Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This Presidential Faculty Fellow Award will support                            
              interdisciplinary work in interstellar chemistry.  The principal               
              investigator, Dr. Lucy Ziurys, will perform high resolution                    
              millimeter and submillimeter spectroscopy in the laboratory of                 
              metal-containing free radicals, and then search for these metal                
              compounds with radiotelescopes to establish their abundances and               
              distributions in the interstellar medium.
