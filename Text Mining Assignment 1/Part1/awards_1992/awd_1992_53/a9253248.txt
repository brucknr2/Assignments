Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This project, sponsored by the University of Wisconsin at Madison,             
              will provided a three year program to train teams of high school               
              and middle school teachers and counselors about career issues in               
              science, engineering and technology,  In the first year 12 teams               
              will meet to learn about scientific and technical careers, develop             
              communication and leadership skills and prepare materials for in-              
              service activities.  In the second year 18 additional teams will               
              join the project to participate in revision of the materials and to            
              prepare for dissemination activities.  In the third year the final             
              drafts of the materials will be developed and the information about            
              careers in science and technology will be dissemitated throughout              
              the state.  The NSF grant is being matched by finds from the                   
              University of Wisconsin at Madison and the institutions in the                 
              collaboration by an amount equivalent to 21% of the grant.
