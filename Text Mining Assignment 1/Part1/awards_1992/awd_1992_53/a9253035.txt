Abstract    :
                    It is proposed to synthesize a series of transition metal                
              complexes that exhibit thermochromic behavior.  The types of                   
              complexes to be synthesized will include those of the                          
              tetrcimetaillate salts, Schiff-base type ligands as well as neutral            
              amine ligands.  In all instances, the conditions will be varied to             
              achieve optimum thermochromic behavior.  The metals used in the                
              study will include first row transition metals as well as members of           
              the third and fourth transition series.  UV-Vis and infrared                   
              spectroscopic measurements will be studied at varied temperatures              
              and pressures.  X-ray crystallography (with variable temperature               
              capabilities) will be used to determine molecular structures and               
              therefore any structural changes that result from thermochromic                
              processes.  Variable temperature NMR will provide a method to                  
              monitor structural as well as magnetic changes of thermochromic                
              solutions.  The effect of "environmental" conditions                           
              (temperature,moisture,natural acids, and UV light) on both free and            
              encapsulated thermochromic compounds will be examined.
