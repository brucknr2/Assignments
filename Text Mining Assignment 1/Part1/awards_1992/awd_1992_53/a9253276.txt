Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The goal of the project is to improve the mathematical and                     
              scientific competence of elementary school students through                    
              the development of teacher enhancement models based in                         
              professional development schools.                                              
                                                                                             
              A professional development school is defined as a partnership                  
              wherein university and school personnel work together as a                     
              team to share what they know, discover new knowledge about                     
              schooling and explore new models of teaching and learning.                     
                                                                                             
              The participants will consist of cohorts of 6 leadership                       
              teachers from each of 4 school districts. One new cohort will                  
              be added in each of the four years.  Two "bridge" teachers                     
              will co-ordinate the activities between districts.  These 26                   
              teachers will participate in weekly 2 hour seminars during 30                  
              weeks of the academic year to enhance their subject field and                  
              pedagogical knowledge and learn appropriate modes of working                   
              with adult learners. During each of 4 summers the leadership                   
              teachers will conduct workshops with teachers within their                     
              schools.  The "bridge" teachers will link the 4 project                        
              schools with the University, each other and eventually other                   
              schools in the district.  Administrators and parents will be                   
              included in the activities to help accomplish change.                          
                                                                                             
              Cost sharing is 18% of the NSF request.
