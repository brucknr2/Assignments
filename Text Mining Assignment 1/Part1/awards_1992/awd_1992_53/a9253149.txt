Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              National Public Radio is seeking to expand its coverage of                     
              scientific issues in two ways:  through the creation of a                      
              new Environmental Reporting Unit, and through the                              
              introduction of SCIENCE FRIDAY, a two hour call-in talk show                   
              dedicated to scientific issues.  Each of these projects will                   
              be supported by an extensive outreach effort targeted at                       
              local schools, community groups, science museums, and nature                   
              centers.                                                                       
                                                                                             
              Through the Environmental Reporting Unit, NPR plans to                         
              produce eight to ten half hour documentary reports per year                    
              on critical environmental issues.  Each of these reports                       
              will be available to listeners on cassette and will be                         
              accompanied by supporting documentation.                                       
                                                                                             
              The SCIENCE FRIDAY team will engage NPR's audience in a                        
              lively debate on questions ranging from nuclear physics to                     
              archaeology.  In addition, SCIENCE FRIDAY will travel to                       
              high schools and museums across the country and engage in                      
              question and answer sessions with students, teachers,                          
              parents and school administrators.  These "on the road"                        
              segments will be supplemented by live broadcasts from annual                   
              meetings of the National Association for Science (NAS) and                     
              the American Association for the Advancement of Science                        
              (AAAS).                                                                        
                                                                                             
              Through these efforts, NPR will be able to draw listener                       
              attention to the need for improved science and mathematics                     
              education, while helping listeners make informed evaluations                   
              of current public policy in these areas.
