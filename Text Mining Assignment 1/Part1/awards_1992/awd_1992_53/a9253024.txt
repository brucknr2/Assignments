Abstract    :
              Parasitic nematodes are important world health and agricultural                
              problems yet are very difficult to study.  As a paradigm, we propose           
              to identify acetylcholine receptor subunit genes from the important            
              human parasitic nematode Onchocerca volvulus using DNA sequence                
              knowledge that we have derived for the equivalent receptor subunits            
              from the laboratory nematode C. elegans.  Acetylcholine receptor               
              mutants of C. elegans are viable and three receptor subunit genes              
              have already been sequenced.  Using monoclonal antibodies raised               
              against purified receptor subunits, PCR, or reduced stringency                 
              hybridization, any remaining C. elegans submit gene will be identified.        
              Identification of all subunits needed to make a receptor will be               
              confirmed by in vitro expression in frog oocytes.  Based on the set of         
              C. elegans sequences, and Onchocerca cDNA library will be amplified            
              with degenerate PCR primers.  PCR primers products will be identified          
              by  sequencing and used to isolate cDNA clones.  Parasite receptor             
              function will be reconstructed first by expressing the parasite receptor       
              in frog oocytes from in vitro RNA transcripts and then fy transforming         
              C. elegans receptor mutant strains with expressible Onchocerca cDNA            
              constructs.  Our approach should identify all subunit genes needed to          
              reconstruct a completely homologous Onchocerca acetylcholine                   
              receptor.  Our model should provide a rationale to develop a                   
              transgenic strains or expression systems for other receptor or cuticular       
              proteins that might be useful in devising drug or immunotherapies              
              against parasitic nematodes.
