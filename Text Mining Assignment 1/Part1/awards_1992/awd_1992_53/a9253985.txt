Abstract    :
              The project involves developing, testing, producing, and                       
              distributing four instructional multimedia software modules for                
              use in beginning college chemistry courses.  Each module                       
              features four "Chemistry Workbench" experiments and a special                  
              patent pending navigation system. By use of point-and-click                    
              mouse techniques, students construct and test different                        
              chemistry experiments for topics in solutions, kinetics, acid-                 
              base equilibria, and electrochemistry.  Modules which                          
              incorporate text, QuickTime color movies, PICT still images,                   
              voice narration, and animation sequence techniques are being                   
              developed for both the Macintosh II family and IBM PC/clone                    
              platforms using a color monitor.  No special video boards,                     
              laserdiscs, or laserdisc players are required to view the                      
              digital motion color images. The modules are programmed using                  
              MacroMedia's "Director", SuperCard, and Swivel 3D software.                    
              The materials are being tested, evaluated and reviewed by                      
              students and chemistry faculty from various colleges and                       
              universities.  Based upon the promise of a prototype, a major                  
              college chemistry textbook publisher is contributing to the                    
              project.
