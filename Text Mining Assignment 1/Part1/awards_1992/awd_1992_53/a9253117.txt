              minorities in the Federal Government's research,                               
              development, and education programs;  and 2)  To                               
              provide on-line access to information on minority                              
              institutions' education, research, and service                                 
              programs; such as, institutional data, extramural                              
              activity (centers, facilities, equipment and consortia                         
              arrangements) and (faculty, undergraduate and graduate
