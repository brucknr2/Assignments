Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This project will recruit 105 middle school teachers from                      
              the Chicago area to participate in a month-long summer                         
              workshop that originates from Columbia College in Chicago,                     
              Illinois.  The project starts in November 1, 1992 and ends                     
              October 31, 1995.                                                              
                                                                                             
              This program extends previous work by Dr. Zafra Lerman from                    
              elementary schools into the middle schools, with the primary                   
              objective being to enhance middle school teachers' content                     
              and pedagogical knowledge in science.  The PI and others                       
              have developed, and are developing, curriculum that                            
              integrates science and mathematics.  The interdisciplinary                     
              approach to the curriculum extends beyond the linkage of                       
              math and science, since the physical, chemical and                             
              biological sciences will also be integrated.  Methods                          
              developed to excite science learning in teachers and                           
              students include the use of art, plays, music, dance, etc.                     
              These approaches also enable teachers to make connections                      
              across the curriculum for the students and illustrate the                      
              everyday context of science and mathematics.                                   
                                                                                             
              There is an approximate cost-share of 27%.
