Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This four year project, sponsored by Creighton University,                     
              will offer 20 high school teachers of chemistry a program to                   
              provide content background and experience in the development                   
              of laboratory experiments and demonstrations.  The teachers                    
              will take a two week program in the summer, and participate                    
              in follow-up activities during the subsequent academic year.                   
              This will be followed by another two week summer session                       
              during which issues which emerged during the academic year                     
              will be discussed.  Altogether three groups of twenty                          
              teachers each will be served by this program.  The NSF award                   
              is being matched by funds from the school districts and the                    
              university by an amount equivalent to 25% of the NSF grant.
