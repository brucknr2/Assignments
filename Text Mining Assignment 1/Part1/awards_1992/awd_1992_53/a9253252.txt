Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              In an effort to increase both the use of technology and actual                 
              data in education, this project will utilize computers and CD-                 
              ROM technology to bring scientific data and curriculum                         
              material developed by NASA, NOAA, and USGS in the Joint                        
              Education Initiative (JEdI) Project into the classroom.  The                   
              use of these materials will allow teachers and students to                     
              investigate their own questions relating to global and                         
              astronomical phenomena.                                                        
                                                                                             
              Scientists that help develop the CD-ROM discs, university                      
              faculty, and industry personnel will serve as mentors                          
              assisting teachers on the access and use of government data                    
              and in its instructional application.  Two hundred and twenty-                 
              five teachers from around the country will be trained during                   
              the three year project which runs from September 1, 1992                       
              through August 31, 1995.  Training will occur at the                           
              University of Maryland (College Park) and Western Washington                   
              University.  Another 660 teachers will receive training from                   
              lead teachers, increasing the total number of teachers reached                 
              in the project to 885.  There will be an approximate cost                      
              share of 27%.
