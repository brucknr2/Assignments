Abstract    :
              Dartmouth College is implementing and testing certain strategies and           
              activities to increase the number of women science majors and encourage        
              them to pursue scientific careers.  The target population is freshman          
              women.  Ninety internships are being carried out by first-year women           
              in the natural sciences, mathematics, and engineering.  This provides          
              (1) an opportunity to work one-on-one with a science faculty member who        
              can serve as a present and future mentor and role model; (2) "hands-on"        
              laboratory work and first-hand experience with scientific inquiry; (3)         
              an important scientific experience complementary to introductory               
              science classes; (4) an experience which de-mystifies and de-                  
              mythologizes science; and (5) stipends to ensure the full participation        
              of economically disadvantaged students.
