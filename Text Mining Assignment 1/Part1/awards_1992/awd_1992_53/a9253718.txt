Abstract    :
              This fellowship will support an investigation into the causes and              
              consequences of interpopulation diversification of behavior in the             
              threespine stickleback fish in northwestern North America.  The                
              Fellow will use a combination of laboratory rearing and laboratory             
              and field experimentation and observation to provide unique                    
              insight into the evolution of behavioral phenotypes in natural                 
              populations of a vertebrate.   The Fellow has also detailed a plan             
              for developing a curriculum in evolutionary biology for                        
              undergraduates, graduate students, and primary and secondary                   
              school teachers.
