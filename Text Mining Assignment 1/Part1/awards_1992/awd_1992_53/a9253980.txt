Abstract    :
              Undergraduate scientific education may fail the novice in                      
              several ways.  One may regard all introductory students as                     
              recruits to be readied for the more advanced work of a major;                  
              others view the education of the non-major as an obligation and                
              offer material that does not attend to the needs of advanced                   
              instruction.  We propose ultimately to develop an alternative--                
              a two-year introductory program in the analysis of human nature                
              from the biological to the social.  This curriculum would                      
              parallel Columbia University's reknowned program in Humanities                 
              that has been emulated by many colleges and universities.  The                 
              course work in this new program would consist of transportable                 
              but interdependent modules that require careful reading and                    
              analysis of primary research papers.  The readings would open                  
              opportunities for a variety of complementary projects.  The                    
              current request is to fund a pilot program to develop and test                 
              a module in psychophysics and expand the quantitative adjuncts                 
              of a second module, molecular biology. The modules integrate                   
              lectures, peer discussion, demonstrations, field work, and                     
              experimentation to forge a real grasp of the methods and                       
              results of science.  Students who complete the complete range                  
              of modules will be able to continue as science majors in                       
              biology, psychology or the social sciences.  The portability of                
              the modules will permit their use, individually or                             
              collectively, by other institutions, and we will plan such                     
              export to other colleges and universities.
