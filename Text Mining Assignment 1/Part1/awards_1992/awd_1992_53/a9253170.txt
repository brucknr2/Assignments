Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This proposal seeks support to enhance the scientific skills                   
              of 72 middle school teachers in Northern Florida and Southern                  
              Georgia. The project is for three years and is designed to                     
              help the middle school teachers improve their knowledge and                    
              understanding of science. The project also aims to decrease                    
              the isolation of these teachers by increasing the                              
              communication between and among teachers and a university-                     
              based team. These needs will be met through the following set                  
              of interrelated activities: (a) Course work in science content                 
              and curriculum and instruction; (b) Activities including                       
              seminar series on: the use of computers for research,                          
              communication and instruction; issues in science education,                    
              such as special needs of minority and female students, and                     
              current topics in science; and leadership training; (c)                        
              Research in both science and science education; (d) Short and                  
              extended site visits; and (e) Communication including                          
              electronic mail, and meetings during the academic year.                        
                                                                                             
              Teachers participating in the project have the opportunity to                  
              complete the program in three years and will have met the                      
              requirements for a Masters' Degree in Science Education.                       
                                                                                             
              Cost sharing is equivalent to 30% of the NSF award.
