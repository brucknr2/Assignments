Abstract    :
              A primary goal of the proposed research is to investigate an                   
              environment that historically has been subject to contamination by             
              heavy metals, and to examine the putative toxicological effects of             
              these heavy metals (particularly arsenic and lead) on samples of the           
              biota characteristic of the heavily urbanized and industrialized El            
              Paso/Cd. Juarez region in the northern Chihuahuan Desert.  Using               
              both the urbanized region and a study area remote from the urban               
              area as a control habitat, studies, using multidisciplinary, integrated        
              approach will be undertaken to (1) assess the extent of heavy metal            
              contamination in representative species and the distribution of the            
              contaminants through the food web, (2) analyze the capacity of                 
              microbes to metabolize the heavy metal contaminants and adjust for             
              them at the molecular genetic level and (3) investigate the putative           
              mechanisms of toxicity at the cellular level through experiments,              
              initially, on plant growth, mutagenic load and gametogenesis in                
              microfauna.                                                                    
                                                                                             
              A second goal of the proposed research is to provide a stimulating             
              research/mentoring environment that will promote the entry of                  
              underrepresented minorities and women into biological sciences,                
              particularly the rapidly to evolving field of environmental toxicology.        
              Students will have the opportunity to become involved in innovative            
              research from the ground up, by sharing in the responsibility of               
              designing experimental protocols, collecting and analyzing the data.           
              Students involved in the program will be encouraged to present the             
              fruits of their research at local and national meetings, providing them        
              with the opportunity to network with others in the field.
