Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This project consists of two parallel and complementary sets of                
              research studies.  In the first, three groups of teachers, one of              
              experienced physics teachers, a second of novice secondary school              
              science teachers, and a third of middle school math and science                
              teachers, will be engaged in collaborative action research on                  
              their own practice.  In the second, a group of university                      
              researchers will be facilitating the teachers' research and                    
              investigating the ways in which they go about doing action                     
              research, as they generate and share knowledge in that process.                
              The primary goals for the project are the improvement of practice              
              and the generation of knowledge of teaching, action research, and              
              teacher development.  These will be accomplished by the                        
              establishment of the action research network, the engagement of                
              teachers in collaborative action research, and the research done               
              by the PI and staff on the teachers' research.
