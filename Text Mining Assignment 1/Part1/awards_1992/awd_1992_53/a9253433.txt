Abstract    :
              In partnership with the Dayton Board of Education and the business             
              community, Wright State University is building a pilot multi-faceted           
              model program for maximizing the number of highly motivated and                
              academically competent women students at Dunbar Magnet High School so          
              that they go on to earn baccalaureate (and higher) degrees in the              
              natural sciences.  Women constitute 52 percent of the student body at          
              Dunbar, and most are minority (95 percent).  The specific goals are:           
              to enhance pre-college science and mathematics courses; to strengthen          
              the teaching skills of high school science teachers by updating their          
              knowledge of modern research tools and techniques; to make science             
              education more active and participatory; to make science relevant; to          
              provide minority and women high school students an orientation to              
              career needs, requirements and opportunities in the natural sciences;          
              to establish year-round links between science teachers, faculty, and           
              the private sector research scientists; to develop a mentor program            
              through which faculty can nurture, encourage, motivate, inspire and            
              challenge women and minority high school students to pursue scientific         
              careers; to form a network of partners with the private sector and seek        
              their involvement in the Dunbar project; and to sensitize the faculty          
              to the educational needs and "culture" of women and minorities.  Since         
              most public high schools in large cities have demographics similar to          
              Dayton's, this pilot model program may be replicated almost unchanged.         
              Thus, its impact is expected to be significant nationally.
