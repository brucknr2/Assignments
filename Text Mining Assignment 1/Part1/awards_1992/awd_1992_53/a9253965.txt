Abstract    :
              The Indiana University SOCRATES PROJECT is contributing to a                   
              critically needed national improvement in university                           
              introductory physics education through research on and                         
              development of interactive engagement methods for cost-                        
              effective mastery learning. In particular, this project is                     
              further developing, improving, and promulgating the Socratic                   
              Dialogue Inducing (SDI) Lab method which has been shown to be                  
              effective in promoting student crossover to the Newtonian                      
              World.  The focus is on mechanics and related areas (fluid                     
              statics and dynamics, oscillations, and waves). The testing                    
              ground is the Indiana University Physics Department's General                  
              Physics I, a large-enrollment, non-calculus based course for                   
              science (but not physics) majors (including prospective high-                  
              and middle-school teachers).  "Real-world" in-class                            
              investigation, well-controlled out-of-class research with paid                 
              student subjects, and in-depth case studies are being utilized.                
              The goals sought are to (1) improve and systematize the                        
              Socratic-dialogue and SDI lab techniques; (2) collaborate with                 
              other instructors to modify the SDI method for various                         
              instructional settings; (3) improve and extend the laboratory                  
              modules and instructor's guides; (4) more widely disseminate                   
              the method by means of publications, talks, workshops, and                     
              distribution of videotapes and lab modules; and (5) continue                   
              the construction of computer Force-Motion-Vector Animations to                 
              assist laboratory and lecture instruction.***//
