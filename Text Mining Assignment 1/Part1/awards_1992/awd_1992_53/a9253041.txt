Abstract    :
              The Division of Chemical Education of the American Chemical Society            
              established a Task Force to study the General Chemistry curriculum             
              in the Fall of 1989.  It has met four times as a body, held two                
              public sessions, and presented a full-day symposium at the 1991 ACS            
              meeting.  FIPSE supported four lectures by Task Force members on               
              revising general chemistry that were part of the symposium, and NSF            
              supported a two-day workshop of the Task Force in August 1991.  As             
              a result of the workshop, the Task Force has appointed three new               
              subgroups and expanded its membership to include a fuller                      
              representation of the research community.  One subgroup is                     
              explicitly charged with recommending administrative reorganization             
              of the Task Force and its relationship to the disciplinary                     
              community.  Other subgroups focus on:  studying innovations in                 
              general chemistry across the country; building general chemistry               
              curriculum form a base of zero; a laboratory-based curriculum; a               
              modular/core approach; and a curriculum drawn conceptually from                
              important applications of chemistry.  During the 1992-93 period the            
              Task Force will continue its efforts to recognize the key elements,            
              approaches, personnel, and organization of national reform of                  
              general chemistry instruction.  It will also continue to plan                  
              proposals seeking major support of the Task Force to initiate                  
              large-scale changes in general chemistry instruction.
