Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The grant continues the work of the Apple Classrooms of                        
              Tomorrow into extended projects to do teacher enhancement in                   
              three school districts.  The classrooms are located in                         
              Cupertino, California, Nashville, Tennessee, and Columbus,                     
              Ohio.  These districts range from 35% to 54% minority                          
              students.  One of the districts, Nashville, has considerable                   
              experience with ACOT and training and will be the lead                         
              district in most activities.                                                   
                                                                                             
              The project helps a large number of teachers gain experience                   
              in the use of  technology in instruction.  The focus is on                     
              "inquiry-based, collaborative and knowledge  building tasks"                   
              in mathematics, science, history and language arts.  Week-long

              per site.  These involve two groups of four teachers in each                   
              serving 48 teachers per site per year.  Summer 4-week long
