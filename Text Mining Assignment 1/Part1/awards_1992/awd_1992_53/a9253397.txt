Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Future Scientists and Engineers of America (FSEA) is a                         
              structured after-school program to promote math and science                    
              through engineering applications among American youth, grades                  
              4 through 12.  FSEA has hands-on projects at increasing levels                 
              of complexity which provide student members with practical                     
              engineering applications of science and mathematics.  Students                 
              advance through categories similar to the Scouts based on                      
              Satisfactory completion of projects.  They enter as a                          
              technician and advance to levels of scientist and engineer.                    
                                                                                             
              Chapters are sponsored by businesses, professional societies                   
              and community organizations which provided mentors and funding                 
              for FSEA projects. Each Project is conducted by a team                         
              consisting of a volunteer teacher and a volunteer mentor.  A                   
              mentor must have a technical background in a scientific or                     
              engineering field.  Mentors can be volunteers recruited from                   
              industry, retired scientists and engineers or engineering                      
              students.                                                                      
                                                                                             
              In less than a year, mentors and teachers have attended start-                 
              up workshops and 24 chapters have been successfully organized.                 
                                                                                             
              Increasing demand for chapter development, with continuing                     
              emphasis on minority and female youth, has created the need                    
              for further development of projects kits, parent involvement                   
              and continuity among feeder schools.  The proposal intends to                  
              develop the procedures, structure and organization that would                  
              enable FSEA to develop an additional 35 chapters in Southern                   
              California and become a national after-school program and                      
              expand to other states.
