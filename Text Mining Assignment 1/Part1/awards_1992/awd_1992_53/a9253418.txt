Abstract    :
              This planning grant, submitted in conjunction with the Minority                
              Research Initiation program of the NSF, is to define reaction                  
              mechanisms through laboratory experimentation and mathematical                 
              modeling, and thereby determine the contributions that gas phase               
              and surface reactions can make in controlling thickness and                    
              uniformity in low pressure chemical vapor deposition (LPCVD)                   
              processes.  The LPCVD process has the capability to deposit films of           
              good thickness uniformity.  This feature makes LPCVD a most                    
              attractive process to be used in step coverage for integrated circuit          
              applications.  The transport phenomena effect on deposition rates              
              (thickness) and uniformity can be determined if the reaction kinetic           
              effects are better established.
