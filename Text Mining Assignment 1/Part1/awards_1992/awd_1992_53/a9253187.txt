Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This project, sponsored by Indiana State University, will                      
              offer 25 teachers each summer a three week workshop covering                   
              meteorology, climatology, geotectonics, natural hazards and                    
              applications in remote sensing.  Teachers will prepare                         
              teaching modules, implement the content in their classrooms                    
              and carry out inservice activities in their districts.  The                    
              project is being supported by the University and local school                  
              districts by an amount equal to 75% of the NSF award.
