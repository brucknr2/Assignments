Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              North Carolina School of Science and Mathematics (NCSSM) is                    
              offering a four year program to create a network of twenty-five                
              pairs of high school lead teachers from across the nation to                   
              disseminate exemplary materials in precalculus and calculus                    
              developed by the NCSSM faculty.  The participants will attend a                
              series of residential summer workshops and will return for                     
              progressively more advanced curricular work and leadership training            
              over the course of three summers.  During the school year they will            
              be supported with an annual conference, a quarterly newsletter, and            
              on-line conferencing, and thee teams will share the new concepts               
              and materials with other teachers in their regions.                            
                                                                                             
              Non-NSF sources will provide cost sharing of 24% of the award.
