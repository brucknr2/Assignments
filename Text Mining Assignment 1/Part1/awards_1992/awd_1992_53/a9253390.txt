Abstract    :
              This proposal is a planning grant to develop a research program                
              which probes the mechanisms by which cyclometalation takes                     
              place. Issues to be addressed include how the C-H bond                         
              approaches the metal atom, how the metal center prepares itself                
              for subsequent insertion into the C-H bond, whether the                        
              mechanism involves an unsaturated metal site, how steric                       
              effects determine which C-H bond participates in the reaction,                 
              and whether there is a difference between intermolecular and                   
              intramolecular mechanisms.  Chromium and tungsten phosphines                   
              and arsines will be studied. Reactions will also be studied by                 
              flash photolysis to detemine whether thermal and excited state                 
              reactions proceed by the same mechanisms.

              This is a planning grant to investigate the mechanism of a very                
              widespread type of reaction -- cyclometalation. The reaction is                
              of considerable commercial importance and a better                             
              understanding of it would be important to many industrial                      
              processes.
