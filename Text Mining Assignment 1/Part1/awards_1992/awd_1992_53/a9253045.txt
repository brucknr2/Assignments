Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The main goal of our research is to understand how muscle functions            
              at the molecular level. The system that we study is the indirect               
              muscle of the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster. AMong the many                
              advantages that this system offers for molecular studies is the                
              fact that these muscles are expendable for viability and therefore             
              amenable for genetic and molecular-genetic analyses. During the                
              course of our investigation, we identified a novel muscle protein              
              that does not resemble any known protein. We hypothesize  that this            
              protein is involved in regulation of muscle contraction. Our goal              
              for this proposal is to identify and characterize mutations that               
              affect the gene encoding this protein. We will then analyze the                
              effect of the mutant protein on the ultrastructural, biochemical               
              and mechanical properties of the muscle. These studies will provide            
              valuable information on the biological function of this protein and            
              on the mechanisms regulating force generation during muscle                    
              contraction.
