Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The New Jersey Institute of Technology (NJIT) will host a                      
              project designed to improve the teaching of science at the                     
              middle school.  This is a one year project that will start                     
              in March, 1993 and provide  middle school teachers the                         
              opportunity to update their content knowledge in                               
              environmental science during a three week summer institute.                    
              Following the institute, the participants will  spend                          
              another three weeks as a laboratory intern working with a                      
              scientist at an industrial site.  Following this summer                        
              institute/internship, teachers will prepare lessons during                     
              the school year with the help of NJIT faculty and their                        
              industrial mentors.  The cost-share of the project will be                     
              approximately 50%.
