Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This project will recruit 264 secondary school master                          
              science teachers from the Los Angeles area to participate in                   
              a three week summer institute.  (This institute may be                         
              offered at different times during the year to allow teachers                   
              on a year round schedule to participate.)  The institute                       
              will be held in Los Angeles and will start September 1, 1992                   
              and end August 31, 1995.                                                       
                                                                                             
              The goal of this program is to develop a relationship                          
              between UCLA, community colleges, and middle and high school                   
              faculty that will lead to the creation of two cross-                           
              curricular, multi-level modules that focus on environmental                    
              science.  The modules will span middle school through                          
              freshman college in content and will be disseminated                           
              throughout the Los Angeles basin.  The project complements                     
              California's Statewide Systemic Initiative and Scope,                          
              Sequence &Coordination projects.                                               
                                                                                             
              Approximate cost-share for the project is 13%.
