Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This proposal provides for the enhancement of content                          
              knowledge and pedagogical skills of under-prepared teachers                    
              of physical science.  Participants will include 24 high                        
              school teachers of physical science in Texas.  The program                     
              will utilize the instruction of a team of experienced,                         
              highly successful high school physical science teachers who                    
              are officers of TTOPS (Texas Teachers Organization for                         
              Physical Science) in conjunction with a pair of university                     
              professors in physics and chemistry.                                           
                                                                                             
              The project includes three components.  These components                       
              focus on a two-week series of summer institute workshops on                    
              the basic concepts taught in the high school physical                          
              science courses; a series of follow-up workshops during the                    
              academic year on supplementary topics; and visits to the                       
              school and classroom of the participants to provide                            
              assistance with the implementation, evaluation of the                          
              program and reinforcement.                                                     
                                                                                             
              Cost sharing is equivalent to 25% of the NSF award.
