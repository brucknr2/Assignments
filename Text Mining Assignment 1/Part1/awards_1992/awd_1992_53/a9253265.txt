Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The Stevens Institute of Technology is offering a three-year                   
              teacher enhancement program to provide intensive training and                  
              support during summer and academic year workshops for 40 mentor                
              teachers from 13 New Jersey school districts, who will in turn                 
              provide inservice programs for more than 300 teachers in their                 
              local schools.  The purpose of the project is to improve student               
              achievement in pre-algebra, and geometry in grades seven through               
              ten.  The project will utilize state-of-the-art software as a                  
              catalyst for teacher change toward a more constructivist and                   
              active learning environment.  The project is built on four years               
              of research and development.                                                   
                                                                                             
              Cost share provided by the university and the schools is 687% of               
              the award.//
