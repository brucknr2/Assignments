Abstract    :
              This is a PFF award for FY 92.  This five-year research program                
              focuses on a combined experimental and theoretical study of the                
              use of chaotic mixing in molten materials to create complex                    
              nanostructure solids that result in new materials with novel                   
              properties.  Methods to establish chaotic behavior in a melt, the              
              effect of the chaotic behavior on the solidification front and                 
              the material microstructure, and the characterization of physical              
              and mechanical properties of the new materials produced will be                
              systematically studied.
