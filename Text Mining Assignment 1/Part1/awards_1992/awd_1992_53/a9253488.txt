Abstract    :
              Research on this grant will be mainly centered in the areas of                 
              computation of combustion processes, numerical fluid dynamics,                 
              and turbulence.  A key distinctive feature of the work                         
              involves model-free simulation of turbulent reactive flows, an                 
              approach divergent from traditional "closure" approaches to                    
              turbulence analysis.  The major thrust of the research is                      
              concerned with development of a basic understanding of                         
              turbulent combustion phenomena, with a study of the pertinent                  
              issues as regards eventual application to practical industrial                 
              applications.  The overall planned activities can be divided                   
              into four major areas: (1) study of fundamental issues as                      
              regards the physics of turbulence and turbulent combustion;                    
              (2) development of advanced computational tools for industrial                 
              use; (3) study of active and passive control of random and                     
              harmonic forcings for enhancement or suppression of mixing in                  
              a research combustor; and, (4) collaborative efforts in                        
              modeling of transport of gametes, spores, and planktonic of                    
              larvae of benthic species in turbulent flows.                                  
                                                                                             
              Among other outputs, this research should provide further                      
              insight into shortcomings associated with existing turbulence                  
              models and identify better approaches to improved (relative to                 
              current turbulent closure approaches) techniques for                           
              utilization in practical turbulent combustion modeling,                        
              providing guidance as to what types of approaches are most                     
              suitable for various classes of turbulent flow problems.  In                   
              addition, the third study listed above has a long-term goal of                 
              establishment of input-output control devices/algorithms for                   
              definition and control of disturbances in practical combustion                 
              devices, while the fourth study is quite important as regards                  
              understanding of the dynamics of settlement and external                       
              fertilization in violent water motion and in modeling the                      
              ecology of wave-swept rocky shores.
