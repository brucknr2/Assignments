Abstract    :
              The project aims to deliver an innovative introductory                         
              astronomy course for non-science majors at a non-selective                     
              state university. The main thrust of the project is to design                  
              a course that focuses on the process of science by identifying                 
              and linking essential astronomical concepts with a minimum of                  
              supporting information.  Within a large lecture course, new                    
              delivery technologies are being tested to increase interaction                 
              and communications so that students will play an active role to                
              engage them with the new material.  The integrated, tested                     
              package should be readily transported to other state university                
              environments.
