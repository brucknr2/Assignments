Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This is a three year project to disseminate the use of an                      
              effective teacher enhancement program in biology, Wisconsin                    
              Fast Plants, to elementary and middle school teachers,                         
              nationwide.                                                                    
                                                                                             
              Four different dissemination models will involve the                           
              presentation of teacher workshops at universities and                          
              colleges, local schools districts, and other institutions,                     
              such as museums.  Workshop leaders at these sites will                         
              include scientists, master teachers, science educators from                    
              museums and other institutions, and Wisconsin Fast Plants                      
              staff.  Non-staff workshop leaders have been, or will be,                      
              trained by the Wisconsin Fast Plants staff.                                    
                                                                                             
              The goals of the project are to 1) enhance teachers' science                   
              attitudes and skills; 2) train teachers to grow and use Fast                   
              Plants for inquiry-based instruction; 3) bring Fast Plants                     
              and better science instruction to underserved students; 4)                     
              encourage community partnerships among educators,                              
              scientists, and institutions; 5) expand the Fast Plants                        
              Network; and 6) continue to support all previous Fast Plant                    
              users.                                                                         
                                                                                             
              An estimated 3,000 teachers will receive training via 126                      
              workshops supported by the Wisconsin Fast Plants Program.                      
              The innovation is expected to spread to an additional 6000-                    
              9000 teachers as a result of the project.                                      
                                                                                             
              Cost sharing equals 21.2% of the NSF award.
