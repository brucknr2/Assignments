Abstract    :
              This fellowship will support research at the interface of biology,             
              sociology, mathematics, and statistics.  The Fellow has developed              
              very general preference-based mating systems in both stochastic                
              and deterministic frameworks.  These systems have application in               
              host-vector interactions, the propagation of cultural traits,                  
              disease transmission dynamics, and food web dynamics.  The Fellow              
              is developing courses that will train students in modeling,                    
              mathematical population studies, and state-of-the-art computer                 
              technology.
