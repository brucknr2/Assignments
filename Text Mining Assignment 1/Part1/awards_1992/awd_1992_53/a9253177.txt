Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This project is a one year planning program that will lead                     
              to the submission of a proposal from Old Dominion University                   
              for a Teacher Enhancement Institute to serve middle-school                     
              biology teachers from the Hampton Roads Region of the state                    
              of Virginia. The planning process will be facilitated by a                     
              Planning Committee with representation from the university                     
              and  regional medical institutions, regional school                            
              districts, and regional biotechnology industries.  The                         
              specific content area to be addressed will be the                              
              integration of mathematics and biology as applied via                          
              biotechnology.                                                                 
                                                                                             
              Cost sharing equals 45% of the NSF award.
