Abstract    :
              The primary focus of the research is in the area of prediction of              
              boundary value problems based on non-linear elasto-plastic finite              
              element analyses.  The goal is to develop a deep understanding of              
              the failure mechanisms and possible preventive measures through a              
              research program which involves various facets of geotechnical                 
              engineering.  The research plan includes: 1. Experimental program              
              to characterize the material: 2. Constitutive modeling (elasto-                
              plastic) including undrained analyses; 3. Optimization based                   
              procedures to obtain the model parameters; 4. Finite element                   
              analyses with localization analyses.
