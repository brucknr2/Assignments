Abstract    :
              The purpose of this proposal is to study the numerical properties              
              of a new adaptive filter algorithm recently introduced by the PI -             
               the Fast Exact Least Mean Square (FELMS) - with a view towards                
              VLSI implementation.  At least one custom/semi-custom digital                  
              signal processor chip will be designed to implement the FELMS                  
              adaptive algorithm and/or related algorithms.                                  
                                                                                             
              A new high-level design automation tool, Olympus (developed at                 
              Stanford University), will be employed in the chip design.  This               
              approach will reduce the design time and give a quick turn-around.             
              It will also serve to exercise these hitherto untested synthesis               
              tools for applications such as the above.  This research will be               
              inter-disciplinary, combining VLSI CAD and Application Specific                
              Integrated Circuit (ASIC)-based architectures, to implement new                
              algorithms and structures for adaptive filters.
