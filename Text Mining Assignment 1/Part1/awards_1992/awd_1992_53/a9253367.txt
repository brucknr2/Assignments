Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Science-By-Mail is a mentorship program between scientists and                 
              youth whereby youth have a subscription for three scientific                   
              challenge packets each year, create solutions, and receive                     
              responses from a personal scientist.  Science-By-Mail brings the               
              excitement of science discovery into classrooms and homes of                   
              children around the country and provides them with positive,                   
              approachable role models of professional scientists.                           
                                                                                             
              A grant of $622,088 over three years will allow us to strengthen               
              and expand this program nationally, focusing especially on                     
              increasing participation by minority youth and scientists.                     
              Specifically, support is requested for the design and                          
              development of 12 new challenge packets; to increase                           
              participation to 47,900 youth, 4,500 scientists, and 26 regional               
              chapters; promote increased corporate and other private-sector                 
              involvement in the program; and to conduct an annual evaluation.               
              The AAAS will aid in the recruitment of volunteer scientists.                  
              In addition, we will work together with the National 4-H Council               
              to pilot the program within that organization (with a membership               
              of 5.4 million), focusing particularly on minority youth.                      
              Anticipated income form the expansion of Science-By-Mail will                  
              make the program self-sufficient at the end of the grant period.//
