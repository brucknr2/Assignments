Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The primary aim of this project is to help 60 high school                      
              mathematics teachers integrate technology (graphing                            
              calculators and computer software) into the 8-12 curriculum-                   
              -while at the same time strengthening their content                            
              background and enriching their pedagogical repertory.  In                      
              the first year, 30 teachers will be chosen (in pairs) from                     
              across the State of Connecticut, but urban areas with                          
              concentrations of minority students will be especially                         
              targeted.  The program consists of two sequential four-week                    
              summer institutes in which the participating teachers will                     
              study and explore applications of technology in the                            
              classroom.  As they do this, they will see that technology                     
              can not only help take the drudgery out of mathematics, but                    
              can also make a wealth of interesting and useful mathematics                   
              accessible to high school students.  The applications of                       
              technology will be studied in the context of modern                            
              mathematical content and modern pedagogical techniques,                        
              e.g., cooperative learning groups.  To help smooth the                         
              implementation and dissemination process, administrators                       
              from the participants' home schools or districts will be at                    
              least briefly involved in the first summer program.  In the                    
              second summer, groups of high school students will be                          
              available for participants to pilot test new lessons and                       
              units as they are developed.  During the first academic                        
              year, project staff will provide support for the teachers'                     
              visits, as well as two scheduled two-day workshops.  During                    
              the second academic year teachers will be expected to engage                   
              in significant staff development work in their buildings                       
              and/or districts, including offering extended workshops of                     
              30-40 hours for their peers.  The program described above                      
              will be repeated for a second group of 30 teachers in years                    
              3 and 4.  Cost sharing amounts to 68% of NSF funding.
