Abstract    :
              Establish a model program for institutions of higher education that            
              guides a cohort of 36 female and ethnic minority students through              
              the mathematics department's calculus sequence.  Pathways through              
              Calculus provides the students the scholastic and emotional support            
              during the summer and during the academic year to successfully                 
              complete this demanding sequence.  Students receive counseling as              
              well as intensive problem solving workshops to help them grasp the             
              "mathematical method" needed to understand the calculus.
