Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The goal of this research is to develop the methodology for using              
              model-tracing tutors to deliver useable classroom instruction.  The            
              context of this effort will be to develop an Algebra I tutor that              
              will be used in the Pittsburgh Public Schools.  As the consequence             
              of past NSF support we have developed a software system for                    
              building such tutors, had extensive experience with building tutors            
              for algebra, and have an established research laboratory in the                
              schools.  This grant will explore how this can be used to deliver              
              a Algebra I tutor that will be used in the schools.  We will try to            
              adapt the expert system development methodology for tutor                      
              development.  Our experts will be a master teacher in the school               
              system and the mathematics faculty in a local high school.  We will            
              work with them on codifying the curriculum (consistent with the                
              standards of the NCTM) that they want to to teach and on making the            
              classroom adjustments to profitably employ the tutor.  This project            
              will serve as a general test of our tutoring methodology and serve             
              as a model for adapting it for other school systems and for other              
              topics.
