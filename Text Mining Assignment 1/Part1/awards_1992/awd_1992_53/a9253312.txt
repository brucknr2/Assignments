Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The proposed three year project is based on an equal                           
              partnership between Hunter College and Community School                        
              District                                                                       
              is to help students in grades 4 through 9, particularly                        
              under-represented groups, achieve their potential in                           
              mathematics, science and technology.  This will be                             
              accomplished through staff development for both teachers and                   
              supervisors and also parent education.                                         
                                                                                             
              During the first two years of the project activities will                      
              focus on teams of at least two teachers from each of the                       
              schools in CSD                                                                 
              in workshops and computer based activities for 15 days                         
              during the spring semester and three weeks in July at Hunter                   
              College. By the end of the spring semester each participant                    
              will have a library that includes grade appropriate                            
              curriculum materials, activities developed by the staff,                       
              computer discs, laser discs, model lessons, assessment                         
              instruments and other educational resources.                                   
                                                                                             
              Field trips to local industry, environmental activities on                     
              the River and an intensive three day "camp" experience at                      
              the Mohonk Mountain Reserve are included in the program and                    
              are designed to help teachers duplicate similar experiences                    
              with students at a later date.                                                 
                                                                                             
              Participating teachers will receive 9 graduate credits in                      
              mathematics, science and technology education upon                             
              successful completion of the program.                                          
                                                                                             
              Over the three years of the project in all of the six                          
              community school districts in Manhattan 270 teachers, 32                       
              supervisors and 300 parents will participate.  This should                     
              directly benefit over 17,500 students.                                         
                                                                                             
              Cost sharing is estimated at 28%.
