Abstract    :
              Electronic systems based on Very Large Scale Integration                       
              (VLSI) have become increasingly complex.  Evolutionary                         
              and revolutionary advances in process control, CAD layout                      
              software, and semiconductor device physics have allowed                        
              circuit designers to place an ever increasing number of                        
              devices on a single chip.  In addition, the band width Hx                      
              VLSI circuits is increasing as well.  All these advances                       
              have led to increasing problems with reliability and                           
              testability of VLSI circuits.                                                  
                                                                                             
              The proposal addresses the problems of reliability and                         
              testability of VLSI circuits.  The research program will                       
              continue ongoing research in the analysis of electronic                        
              performance of VLSI circuits and in the design and                             
              implementation of on-chip test and analysis circuits.  In                      
              addition, the proposal addresses the problem of VLSI                           
              circuit failure due to ionizing radiation.                                     
                                                                                             
              The project will support the training of minority                              
              graduate students in this important area over a three                          
              year period.
