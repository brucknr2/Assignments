Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The University of Kentucky seeks support to develop a statewide                
              network of middle grades mathematics teachers, align mathematics               
              content and teaching practices in the state with the NCTM                      
              Standards, and provide opportunities for collaboration among                   
              classroom teachers, instructional supervisors, teacher educators,              
              and university mathematicians.  Eight teams of university faculty,             
              classroom teachers, and instructional supervisors will develop                 
              seminars designed to enhance the teaching of algebra, geometry,                
              probability and statistics.  Pedagogical emphases include problem              
              solving, use of manipulatives and technology, cooperative learning,            
              and alternative forms of assessment.  The teams will conduct                   
              seminars for 300 middle grades teachers throughout Kentucky, who               
              will in turn conduct workshops and establish support groups for                
              middle grades teachers in their respective districts.  All eight               
              state universities and four private colleges in Kentucky will                  
              participate in the project.                                                    
                                                                                             
              Cost share provided by the universities and the schools is 25% of              
              the award.
