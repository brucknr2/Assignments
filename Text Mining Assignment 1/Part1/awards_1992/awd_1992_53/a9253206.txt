Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              A summer institute in physics will be offered to 20 teachers.                  
              The institute will be 6-8 weeks in length.  Those participants                 
              who opt for the longer time will have the opportunity to be                    
              involved in a research experience with the university faculty                  
              for 2 weeks.  There will be 6 two day follow up sessions on the                
              university campus during the academic year.  Electronic                        
              networking between the teachers is anticipated where feasible.                 
              Graduate credit will be offered for those who complete the                     
              entire program.                                                                
                                                                                             
              The project is aimed mainly at teachers whose major was in an                  
              area of science other than physics who teach in smaller schools                
              in rural areas in Northern Illinois and Southern Wisconsin.  A                 
              few leader/master teachers will be included.  These teacher will               
              act as mentors for the under prepared participants.                            
                                                                                             
              A strong emphasis in the program is placed on the constructivist               
              approach to teaching to reflect the results of current research                
              in physics teaching.  Demonstrations, laboratory experiments,                  
              field trips and seminars will broaden the spectrum of course                   
              offerings.                                                                     
                                                                                             
              Cost sharing is (43%).//
