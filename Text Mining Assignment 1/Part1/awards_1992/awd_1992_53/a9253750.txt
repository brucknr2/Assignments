Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Dr. Aoki has been selected to receive one of 30 prestigious NSF                
              Presidential Faculty Fellowship awards based upon her outstanding              
              research accomplishments.  During the period of this award, Dr. Aoki           
              will be using electron microscopic immunocytochemistry to identify             
              chemically specified axons or growth cones in relation to                      
              transmitter receptors within intact cortical tissue.  At birth, the            
              density of synapses in the cerebral cortex is no more than 10% of              
              the adult level, and nothing is presently known about the                      
              development of chemically specified synapses within cortex.  The               
              maturation of noradrenergic and excitatory synapses during early               
              life is particularly important for understanding the mechanisms that           
              underlie cortical plasticity.  The importance of noradrenaline in              
              cortical plasticity is reflected in a new working hypothesis                   
              supported by results that cortical plasticity is dictated by the               
              dual modulation of excitatory synapses utilizing both catecholamines           
              and acetylcholine.
