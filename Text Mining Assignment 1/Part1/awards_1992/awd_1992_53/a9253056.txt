Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This project, sponsored by the Fermi National Acceleration                     
              Laboratory, will institute a conference for outstanding                        
              Illinois educators to carry out a state needs assessment and                   
              a goals development study for a teacher enhancement program                    
              for the State of Illinois.  The conference membership                          
              consists of 60 outstanding teachers, former NSF Principal                      
              Investigators from the state of Illinois and five people                       
              representing the Illinois State Board of Education.  The                       
              expected outcome of the conference is a suggested outline of                   
              a Teacher Enhancement Proposal which will be prepared by the                   
              conference task force.                                                         
                                                                                             
              The NSF funds are being matched by funds from the Illinois                     
              State Board of Education in an amount equivalent to 34% of                     
              the NSF grant.
