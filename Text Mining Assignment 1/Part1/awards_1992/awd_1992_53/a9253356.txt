Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The Boulder Valley Project will expand the uses and support                    
              of the Internet throughout the Boulder Valley School                           
              District, Boulder, Colorado, over a three year period.                         
              Through concentrating on horizontal infusion into three                        
              middle schools and vertical infusion onto one elementary,                      
              one middle and one senior high school in a feeder pattern,                     
              the training and development will be maximized.  The                           
              teachers directly trained will become peer instructors.                        
              Ultimately, over two-hundred and fifty-eight teacher and                       
              administrators will be trained and have access to the                          
              Internet including all building principals.                                    
                                                                                             
              The project has three distinct stages.  In the first, a core                   
              group of teachers who will later become peer instructors is                    
              trained on the Internet including e-mail and access to                         
              files.  In the second stage, the network is used as a                          
              practical way to induce students to internalize a foreign                      
              language.  In the third stage, connectivity and training are                   
              spread throughout the district.  Curriculum development of                     
              lessons which employ the network is done and disseminated.                     
                                                                                             
              The university and partners cost share 40% of this project.
