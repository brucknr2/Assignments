Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  Through this project, Brooklyn Technical High School and                  
              its partners provide summer and follow-up school inservice,                    
              mentoring and leadership development experiences for 72 New                    
              York City high school teachers.  These teachers, in turn,                      
              become teacher/leaders for many other teachers in hands-on                     
              uses of technology in science and mathematics.  Over the three                 
              years of the project, the teachers create appropriate lessons,                 
              devise strategies for incorporating them into the curriculum,                  
              and other teachers in these techniques.                                        
                                                                                             
                   The participating teachers learn to develop materials for                 
              their own classrooms based on what is currently used in the                    
              junior and senior pre-engineering curriculum at Brooklyn                       
              Technical High School.  Science content with mathematics is                    
              emphasized using cooperative problem solving models with hands                 
              on learning.  Technology and computer are integral parts of                    
              the process.
