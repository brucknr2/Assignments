Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Teachers will be recruited to participate in a year long                       
              enhancement project.  The program will have two summer                         
              workshops coupled to activities spaced throughout the year.                    
              Two-hundred forty high school teachers from Massachusetts,                     
              New York, and Texas may participate in the workshops that                      
              will be held in the state of New York.                                         
                                                                                             
              This project will develop partnerships between high school                     
              teachers, ecologists, and pedagogy experts in an effort both                   
              to enable teachers to experience the process of science and                    
              to implement effectively a constructivist curriculum in                        
              their classrooms.  Teacher and ecologist participants will                     
              be selected from the three states in an effort to establish                    
              long-term collaborations between these groups.                                 
                                                                                             
              Approximate cost-share for the project is 3.5%.
