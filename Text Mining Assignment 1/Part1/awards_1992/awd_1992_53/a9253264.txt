              This project is a one year planning program that will lead                     
              to the submission of a proposal from Florida State                             
              University for a Teacher Enhancement Institute to serve high                   
              school biology teachers from the state of Florida.  The                        
              planning process will be facilitated by a Planning Committee                   
              with representation from all segments of the Florida biology                   
              education community.
