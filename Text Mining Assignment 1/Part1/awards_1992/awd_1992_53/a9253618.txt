Abstract    :
              This research is aimed at the continued                                        
              development of and student training in                                         
              high resolution soft x-ray optical techniques                                  
              for microscopy and lithography.  Using an                                      
              undulator at the National Synchrotron Light                                    
              Source at nearby Brookhaven National                                           
              Laboratory, we are able to obtain coherent                                     
              beams of x-rays with a wavelength of 1-5                                       
              nm (the wavelength of visible light is 400-                                    
              700 nm).  The PI has developed a                                               
              scanning x-ray microscope which focusses                                       
              these soft x-rays to a 50 nm spot, and this                                    
              microscope is being used both for                                              
              transmission microscopy studies of wet,                                        
              thick biological specimens, and for the                                        
              development of new imaging modalities.                                         
              The PI has also demonstrated the ability to                                    
              record x-ray holograms of biological                                           
              specimens at 50 nm resolution, and our                                         
              efforts in holography and developments at                                      
              laser labs are leading towards the goal of                                     
              recording 20 nm resolution holograms with                                      
              psec exposure times, thus imaging a                                            
              specimen in a timescale shorter than that                                      
              of radiation damage.  Finally, the PI has                                      
              also developed a method for designing                                          
              masks for x-ray lithographic manufacture of                                    
              future integrated circuits based on                                            
              referenceless on-axis computed                                                 
              holograms; it is hoped to bring this method                                    
              from computer simulation to experimental                                       
              demonstration.
