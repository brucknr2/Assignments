Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              BACKYARD SAFARI (Working Title) is an engaging series of 26                    
              half hour programs designed to introduce topics in Natural                     
              Science to children ages four to six.  The series will be                      
              shot on-location and hosted by an appealing young women of                     
              color, who will serve as a role model to female and minority                   
              children who are normally disenfranchised from participation                   
              in science.  A variety of settings and topics will be used                     
              that appeal to all preschoolers -- from urban/inner cities                     
              to surburbia to Appalachia.  A special feature of the series                   
              will be an animated gnome - like character called                              
              Crinkleroot.  Using the rotoscope technique similar to that                    
              in the "Who Framed Roger Rabbit?", Crinklroot will interact                    
              in screen with the host and special, acquired footage.                         
              Thus, Crinkleroot is able to do things the host can't do --                    
              for example, interacting with time-lapse photography as a                      
              flower blooms, or as a spider climbs its web.                                  
                                                                                             
              Outreach to parents and childcare providers will be an                         
              important part of BACKYARD SAFARI.  It is imperative to                        
              communicate that all children, regardless of race, sex, or                     
              disability are "science material."  Activities will be                         
              developed that engage adults and children in hands-on,                         
              physical science activities using materials commonly found                     
              in any home or school.
