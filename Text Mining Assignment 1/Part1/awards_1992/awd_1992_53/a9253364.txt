Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The goal of the project is to produce a one hour television                    
              documentary and a series of video teaching modules which explore               
              a wide range of scientific disciplines in an exciting manner by                
              presenting the story of how these disciplines are used in the                  
              preparation and racing of an Indianapolis race car.  This                      
              program will be distributed to a wide audience through its                     
              broadcast by PBS and cable sports networks; through                            
              dissemination to classrooms and museums nationwide; and through                
              distribution via agencies that focus on bringing educational                   
              programs to youth and minorities across the country.  We expect                
              to attract a new audience to science, the millions of Americans                
              who are infatuated by automobiles.  This is an audience that                   
              cuts across age, ethnic and racial distinctions in America                     
              today.  This exciting story of applied science should also                     
              appeal to American youth in a way that more traditional science                
              stories do not.                                                                
                                                                                             
              The major scientific disciplines involved in the project are:                  
              basic engineering, mathematics and physics, aerodynamics,                      
              materials science, mechanics, telemetry and computer aided                     
              design.                                                                        
                                                                                             
              This project is submitted to the Informal Science Education                    
              Program.                                                                       
                                                                                             
              The specific content of this project will be aimed at an                       
              audience with little background in science.  High-school                       
              students and adults should be able to understand all the                       
              principles presented.  Younger audiences will gain insight into                
              how a knowledge of science is fundamental to a sport that many                 
              of them find fascinating.
