Abstract    :
              The purpose of this proposal is to develop and implement an                    
              experiment-based hands-on program which will introduce girls in the            
              4th, 5th and 6th grades to the physical sciences.  The project is              
              a collaborative effort between the principal investigator who is a             
              professor of Physics at the University of Missouri and the Science             
              Coordinator of the Columbia Public School System.  Several topics              
              such as Optics, Sound, Electricity, Magnetism and Mechanics have               
              been selected to introduce girls to simple concepts in Physics                 
              through the development of games, experiments, toys, art projects              
              and laboratory experiments.  The project expects to motivate the               
              girls by conveying that science is fun, but more importantly, by               
              familiarizing them with scientific equipment and concepts.  The                
              program is an extra-curricular activity in its initial phase.  It              
              is expected that the material developed will be integrated into the            
              regular curriculum in the future.
