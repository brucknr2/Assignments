Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The proposers have developed a model for improving teacher                     
              education called Teaching Teleapprenticeships.  Using this                     
              model, teacher education students and practicing teachers                      
              learn about teaching and learning by participating in                          
              electronic network-based activities with K-12 students and                     
              teachers and university-based scientists and teacher                           
              educators.  They will implement and evaluate this model as a                   
              means of improving the preparation of science and mathematics                  
              teachers.  To support this model, they will develop, evaluate,                 
              and disseminated communication tools that allow these Teaching                 
              Teleapprenticeships to be practiced widely in a diverse set of                 
              science and mathematics educational settings.
