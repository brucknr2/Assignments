Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The National Faculty of Humanities, Arts and Sciences, Inc.                    
              seeks funds for a six-month planning project to help prepare                   
              the teachers in the territory of American Samoa in                             
              mathematics.  Over 80% of the teachers have only a two year                    
              degree and very few of the rest have four year degrees and                     
              certification. The aim of the project is to identify the                       
              primary academic and pedagogical needs of teachers who are                     
              not certified, to provide initial assistance through the                       
              National Faculty scholars in meeting those needs, and to                       
              develop a plan for a multi-year program to address the needs                   
              of American Samoa teachers in mathematics. The planning                        
              project will bring together in a collaborative effort                          
              American Samoa teachers, administrators, Territorial                           
              education officers, government officials, and National                         
              Faculty scholars and staff.                                                    
                                                                                             
              The National Faculty will share the costs of the project by                    
              covering over 20% of the expenses.  The total funding awarded                  
              is $49,900.00
