Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              SALT will offer courses and workshops for participating                        
              teachers from each public elementary school in Pickens                         
              County for a period of 3 years.  These teachers will from a                    
              core of lead teaches and math specialists so that every                        
              elementary school has 1 or 2 lead teachers or a math                           
              specialist.  These teachers will be trained in a hands-                        
              on/problem solving approach to learning mathematics and will                   
              be a resource for other teachers in their school.  This                        
              project is an extension of a two year pilot program which                      
              puts a math specialist in the Forest Acres Elementary                          
              School.
