Abstract    :
              9253419  Campo  This planning grant pertains to the understanding of the 
              transport phenomena associated with the turbulent flow and  heat transfer of a
              radiatively participating gas inside  internally finned annuli.  The primary
              objective of this  work is to use finite-volume techniques to simulate 
              numerically the velocity, temperature and radiative fields  in the fluid medium
              at high temperature.  Further, this work  is intended to present for the first
              time global results  such as the friction factor and average Nusselt number
              which  are used in the thermal analysis and design of heat exchange  devices.
