Abstract    :
              This is an award to provide support                                            
              for research by this Presidential                                              
              Faculty Fellow who will study the                                              
              anaerobic decomposition of organic                                             
              compounds that are contained in                                                
              wastes that are placed in                                                      
              landfills.  The investigator plans                                             
              on determining the effects of                                                  
              organic substances on the                                                      
              decomposition process and will work                                            
              toward characterization of the                                                 
              dominant microorganisms that are                                               
              involved in the decomposition                                                  
              process.
