Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This three year project, sponsored by Portland State                           
              University, will carry out a program, enrolling 25 well                        
              prepared high school chemustry teachers each year, which                       
              will acquaint teachers with the chemistry processes used in                    
              industry and connect them to the high school chemistry                         
              course.  The teachers will meet during the academic year and                   
              in the summer for a total of 27 days.  Teachers will visit                     
              research and industrial laboratories, study laboratory                         
              management and instruction issues and prepare laboratory                       
              experiences for application to the regular classroom.  Each                    
              teacher will work to disseminate the approach in his/her                       
              district.  The NSF award is being matched by the University,                   
              by an amount equivalent to 7% of the grant.
