Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This project is a three-year program to establish a                            
              partnership of five universities, fifteen community                            
              colleges, the State Department of Education, and school                        
              districts from throughout the state of Mississippi to                          
              improve high school biology education.  In order to                            
              accomplish this goal, ten five-member teams from throughout                    
              the state (three high school teachers and two community                        
              college instructors per team) will be prepared as master                       
              teachers at two summer institutes in the content areas of                      
              molecular biology, genetics and evolution.  The institutes                     
              will be hosted by The University of Southern Mississippi.                      
                                                                                             
              The teams will collaborate with the State Department of                        
              Education in the revision of the high school biology                           
              curriculum and will conduct 52 hour workshops at local sites                   
              throughout the state that will update an additional 470 high                   
              school biology teachers in the content area focus and                          
              appropriate pedagogy.  An equipment lending program will                       
              support the equipment needs of the teachers in the                             
              implementation of new laboratory explorations.                                 
                                                                                             
              The specific objectives of the project are to help teachers                    
              1) integrate the processes of science skills to the teaching                   
              of biology concepts, 2) build students' conceptual                             
              understanding of biology rather than the recall of isolated                    
              facts, 3) acquire laboratory and field skills appropriate                      
              for teaching these contemporary topics, and 4) to develop                      
              strategies to teach decision-making on biological and                          
              controversial issues.                                                          
                                                                                             
              Cost sharing equals 51.9% of the NSF award.
