Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              During this 30-month project four modules will be developed                    
              for use in staff development to enhance the teaching of                        
              elementary school science.  The materials will include a set                   
              of learning guides and interactive videodiscs to present                       
              theory and rationale and to model innovative approaches to                     
              curriculum and instruction.  The modules will focus on                         
              innovative instruction (constructivism, cooperative                            
              learning, and learning styles), curriculum emphases                            
              (thematic and STS), equitable teaching, and alternative                        
              assessment, and will incorporate the nature of science and                     
              technology, major science concepts, classroom management,                      
              educational technology, and the interrelationship of science                   
              and mathematics.                                                               
                                                                                             
              This project is appropriate for the Teacher Enhancement                        
              Program because it is designed to produce high quality                         
              materials for staff development in the effective teaching of                   
              elementary school science and will utilize NSF-funded                          
              curricular materials, thus enhancing dissemination of these                    
              materials.                                                                     
                                                                                             
              Non-NSF cost-sharing is approximately 20% of the amount                        
              requested from NSF.
