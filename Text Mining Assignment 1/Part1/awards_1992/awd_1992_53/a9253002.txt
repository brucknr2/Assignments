Abstract    :
                   This study proposes to investigate how computer and                       
              communications technology can influence teaching and learning                  
              paradigms in engineering education in the next decade.  Recognizing            
              that (1) pedagogical models for engineering education have remained            
              relatively unchanged for almost half a century and that (2)                    
              advances in computer and communication technology make possible the            
              restructuring of the way engineering education is delivered, this              
              study will explore and contrast the ways in which technology can               
              facilitate the delivery of engineering education.  The focus of the            
              project is on how technology permits more rapid and comprehensive              
              delivery of engineering education, for example, by using                       
              multimedia, distance education, intensive simulation experiences,              
              virtual realities and teamwork experiences.  An emphasis is placed             
              in this study on understanding the relationship between predicted              
              technology capabilities and how these capabilities can influence               
              pedagogical outcomes.  Data are to be secured from both academic               
              and industrial groups and multiple scenarios are to be evaluated in            
              order to make recommendations about how public policy should be                
              formulated to best influence future directions in engineering                  
              education.
