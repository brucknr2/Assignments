Abstract    :
              Dr. Gerard Parkin of the Chemistry Department, Columbia                        
              University, is one of thirty recipients of the 1992                            
              Presidential Faculty Fellow Award.  This prestigious award for                 
              young faculty members is given in recognition of excellence and                
              promise in scientific research and teaching.  Parkin was                       
              honored for work in inorganic and bioinorganic chemistry.  He                  
              has shown through meticulous methods that bond-stretch                         
              isomerism is an artifact of crystallographic impurities.  His                  
              work with main group and transition metal complexes of                         
              (pyrazolyl)hydroborate have led to novel results.  First, he                   
              isolated and characterized the first monomeric three-coordinate                
              zinc alkyl derivative and the monomeric terminal hydride                       
              complexes of zinc and beryllium.  In addition, he has developed                
              a monomeric zinc hydroxy derivative which serves as a                          
              structural and chemical model for active site of the enzyme                    
              carbonic anhydrase.  Recently, he has isolated compounds with                  
              terminal tellurium bonds.  He is also known as an enthusiastic                 
              teacher and mentor and has been involved in curriculum revision                
              and a special program with high school students.
