Abstract    :
                    Consistent with the proposed Presidential Executive Order to             
              provide surplus/excess equipment to qualified institutions, it is              
              considered appropriate that Mary Holmes College receive this award.            
                    The College, in a cooperative effort with the West Point                 
              Mississippi public school system, is intensely involved in a program           
              to motivate at-risk students to continue in a program of formal                
              education.  This initiative is consistent with the Division of Human           
              Resource Development's programs.
