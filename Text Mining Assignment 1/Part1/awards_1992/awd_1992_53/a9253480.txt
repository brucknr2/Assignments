Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This project is a collaboration by the Children's Museum,                      
              Museum of Science, and Franklin Park Zoo designed to provide                   
              hands-on science activities and increase interest in science                   
              as a career for children in grades 6-8 who attend community                    
              agency after school programs.  Groups of 20-25 students will                   
              attend 8-week courses at each institution, rotating to all                     
              three during the year.  After completing the courses, selected                 
              students will become interns for summer training and work at                   
              the institutions. The goals of the project are to offer                        
              engaging science to underserved children and motivate them to                  
              further study; to build a bridge to community groups from the                  
              three institutions; to bolster science programs at community                   
              centers through training their staff; and to create a                          
              replicable model for other science centers, children's museums                 
              and nature centers to work with community agencies and to                      
              involve parents in their children's activities.  Videotapes,                   
              to be produced by WGBH-PBS will be distributed to science                      
              centers: tapes will document finding effective ways to work in                 
              the children, the particular experiences of the three                          
              institutions, and the children's experiences with and                          
              attitudes toward science.  A summer institute will be held for                 
              museum professionals from other institutions.//
