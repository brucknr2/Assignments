Abstract    :
              The research project of this Presidential Faculty Fellow is in the             
              general area of analytical and surface chemistry and in the                    
              subfield of surface microscopy.  During the five-year tenure of                
              this award, Professor Hamers and his students will utilize                     
              scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) and related techniques to                  
              observe, understand, and control the surface chemistry of solid                
              state materials at an atomic level.  These important goals will be             
              pursued by using STM techniques to identify molecular surface                  
              species; through the integration of STM with other chemically                  
              sensitive techniques such as infrared absorption spectroscopy;                 
              through the development of novel scanned probe techniques which                
              could provide new methods for achieving elemental and/or                       
              functional group identification on nanometer distance scales; and              
              by making use of the STM tip as an active tool for inducing                    
              chemical changes in this distance domain.

              The successful attainment of the goals of this project should give             
              rise to new techniques for the atomic-scale characterization of                
              solid surfaces as well as innovative chemical insights regarding               
              surface reactions which are of immense technological significance.             
              Additionally, this Presidential Faculty Fellowship should                      
              significantly assist Professor Hamers in the continuing                        
              development of his vital and productive program of research and                
              research training.
