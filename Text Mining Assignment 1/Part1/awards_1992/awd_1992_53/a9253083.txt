Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This proposal seeks to improve the quality of science                          
              instruction in the elementary classroom. The project will                      
              focus on the development of activities that will improve the                   
              science content knowledge and pedagogical skills in ten school                 
              districts in the state of Arkansas. To determine where                         
              enhancement in science is most needed, an assessment will be                   
              conducted during the planning period utilizing the teachers,                   
              science supervisors, principals, superintendents and other key                 
              personnel in the assessment process. Organizations that impact                 
              science education will be contacted so that a coordinated                      
              effort will be made for the development of a science program                   
              that will have a tremendous impact on science teachers in the                  
              state of Arkansas.                                                             
                                                                                             
              The PI has identified some critical elements of the planning                   
              activity that will require support, as this is an attempt to                   
              coordinate a large scale reform of teacher enhancement in                      
              elementary science education. The project will result in a                     
              restructuring of science activities for the teachers through                   
              a full  proposal which will be submitted later for funding.
