Abstract    :
                   This P.I. will conduct research on thermal convection in the              
              Earth, which is the driving force of plate tectonics and hence of              
              earthquakes, volcanoes, and other geological processes.  This                  
              research will help in the understanding of the mechanisms by                   
              which convection drives geological processes by using three                    
              dimensional numerical models of mantle flow interacting with                   
              overlying plates.  The research is unique because she has the                  
              expertise to add geochemical constraints to geophysical models                 
              for convective flow.  She will model specific fundamental surface              
              features of the crust (rifts, hot spots, and subduction zones),                
              trying to find the limits of the mantle models required to                     
              produce them.
