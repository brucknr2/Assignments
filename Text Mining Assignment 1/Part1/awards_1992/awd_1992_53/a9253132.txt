Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This research is concerned with linear and non-linear optical                  
              properties of colloidal microparticles.  The microparticles are                
              prepared by methods such as condensation, oxidation-reduction                  
              reaction, and electrical dispersion.  The nonlinear optical                    
              properties are investigated using the frequency-doubled output of              
              a Nd:YAG laser at 532 nm for degenerate four-wave mixing.  A                   
              determination of the third-order susceptibility is made from the               
              intensity of the optical phase conjugate signal generated in the               
              four-wave mixing.  The nonlinear optical property of the                       
              microparticles is determined as the function of cluster size and               
              composition.  These studies are of interest because they:  a) will             
              allow a direct test of the predictions of theory, b) will enhance              
              the current understanding of the quantum size effects, c) have                 
              possible application in new optical switches, optical gates, etc.              
              and d) will enhance quality of education at a minority                         
              undergraduate institution.
