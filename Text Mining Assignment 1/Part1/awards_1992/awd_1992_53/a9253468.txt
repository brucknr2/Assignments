Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The North Carolina State Museum of Natural Sciences requests                   
              $544,390 for the design and implementation of Freshwater                       
              Westlands:  Habitats of Beauty and Function.  This project                     
              consists of two main components:  a 2,800 sq. ft. exhibit                      
              and related education program.  The exhibit will communicate                   
              ecological principles and provide visitors of all ages with                    
              an appreciation of the diversity and beauty of freshwater                      
              wetlands habitats.  The exhibit is comprised of three main                     
              areas:  an introductory theater, an immersion diorama, and                     
              an interactive hall.  Exhibits are designed to present many                    
              aspects of freshwater wetland habitats, including hydrology,                   
              dendrochronology, organism structure, and function, life-                      
              cycle, ecological research, and environmental policy.                          
              Through interactive exhibits on scientific concepts,                           
              visitors will gain an appreciation of both a particular                        
              habitat and the process of science and its application to                      
              their lives.  The major objectives of the education program                    
              are to help teachers of grades 4-8 to bring the study of                       
              freshwater wetlands into their classrooms and to employ                        
              experientially oriented pedagogy.  The project will offer a                    
              teacher resource guide, prepared in collaboration with state                   
              science curriculum staff, a satellite workshop for teachers,                   
              a freshwater wetlands edition of Wildlife in North Carolina,                   
              a statewide publication prepared in collaboration with the                     
              NC Wildlife Resources Commission, and a classroom program in                   
              the museum.
