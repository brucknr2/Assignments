Abstract    :
                   This project addresses the problem of high capacity PCN design            
              in man-made environments.  The work is in two areas: (1) radio                 
              propagation measurements and modeling, and (2) communication system            
              design.  The research combines these two areas into a unified                  
              approach to system design.  The research combines the effects of               
              local average channel characteristics with modulation, access,                 
              coding, and user traffic patterns in order to study the effects of             
              cellular layouts and handoff methods for capacity improvements in              
              high density wireless PCNs.  In view of the high cost of radio                 
              spectrum and the necessity to conserve it, the work could provide              
              research results and design tools which will be very valuable to               
              the U.S. communications industry through efficient spectrum usage              
              and automated wireless system deployment.
