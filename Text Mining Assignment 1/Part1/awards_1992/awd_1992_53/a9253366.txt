Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The videodisc-based exhibit, the Powers of Ten in Time, will                   
              allow museum visitors to explore the unseen world of natural                   
              change - events that occur too quickly or too slowly to be                     
              perceived.                                                                     
                                                                                             
              Through the use of a touch screen and interactive software,                    
              users will be able to, in effect, speed up or slow down timeto                 
              witness changes that lie outside of the limits of human time                   
              perception.  Visitors will see scenes such as a forest                         
              recovering after a fire, a wall of earth crumbling from erosion,               
              tides coming in and out, the intricate motions of complex                      
              machinery and molecules colliding and reacting to produce fire.                
              The videodiscs will contain more than 100 short video segments                 
              depicting a wide range of phenomena.  We will use time-lapse                   
              footage, slow-motion clips and animations to show changes                      
              occurring over time periods form 300,000,000 to femtoseconds.                  
                                                                                             
              Not only will museum visitors be able to watch these video                     
              segments at their own pace and in order they choose, they will                 
              also be able to learn more about such phenomena through on-                    
              screen textual and graphical explanations.  The goal of the                    
              project is to engage museum visitors with captivating                          
              photographic segments, explain the phenomena shown with                        
              supplemental text and graphics, and stimulate them to look at                  
              the world in a new way - not  just with their eyes, but with                   
              their minds and imaginations.
