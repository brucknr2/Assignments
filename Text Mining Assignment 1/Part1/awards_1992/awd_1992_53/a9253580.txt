Abstract    :
              This is a 1992 Presidential Faculty Fellow                                     
              Award (PFF).  Micro- and nanostructure                                         
              fabrication  can be applied to a plethora of                                   
              interesting problems.  The PI will expand his                                  
              work on ultrasmall electronic devices.  An                                     
              especially significant topic will be issues in                                 
              ultrasmall interconnects for ULSI.  This                                       
              includes cross talk in very dense circuits and                                 
              electromigration in lines narrower than 0.1                                    
              micron.
