Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The PI proposes to generalize the three-dimensional model developed            
              in his previous work to include bottom topography.  The proposed               
              study consists of the development of a hierarchy of ocean                      
              circulation models based upon the planetary geostrophic equations,             
              i.e., the equations of motion with relative acceleration terms                 
              replaced by a simple Rayleigh friction.  The PI's goal is to                   
              develop a three-dimensional, finite element, moving-vertical-node,             
              world-ocean planetary geostrophic model within the proposed three-             
              year cycle.  Such a model offers an attractive alternative to                  
              existing primitive-equation models and could be useful in climate              
              studies because it can be solved efficiently enough to be run for              
              the hundreds or thousands of model years required to reach                     
              equilibrium.
