Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This three-year award supports U.s.-France cooperative research                
              in mathematical physics between Daniel Boyanovsky, University                  
              of Pittsburgh, and Hector J. de Vega, Theoretical Physics                      
              Laboratory, University of Paris VI.  The main objective of the                 
              proposal is to investigate current topics in quantum field theory              
              and statistical mechanics, in particular the early stages of phase             
              transitions, tunneling and metastability in field theory,                      
              relationship between quantum integrability and renormalization.                
              These topics have applications to a broad range of problems in                 
              cosmology (early stages of evolution of the early universe),                   
              particle physics, condensed matter physics (superconductivity) and             
              statistical mechanics.                                                         
                                                                                             
              The investigators bring to this collaboration their complementary              
              expertise on these diverse topics.  Dr. Boyanovsky has been                    
              working on problems in mathematical physics from the point of                  
              view of equilibrium and non-equilibrium statistical mechanics and              
              field theory.  The French investigator is well-known for his                   
              expertise in non-perturbative field theory methods and techniques              
              for studying physics at finite temperature.
