Abstract    :
              The relationship between mechanical and tribological properties                
              of lubricating solids will be studied.  The mechanical properties              
              of a number of solid lubricant materials will be determined under              
              conditions of very high hydrostatic pressure, very high strain                 
              rates and very large strains, simulating the conditions in an                  
              asperity contact region.  Parallel tribological experiments will               
              be carried out to measure friction, film thinning rates and wear               
              behavior.  The materials to be tested have been selected for                   
              their lubricating properties and their differences in crystal                  
              structure, texturing behavior, melting point and stacking fault                
              energies; they include silver, tin, indium, graphite, MoS2 and                 
              graphite fluoride.  Detailed microstructure studies of worn films              
              will also be performed to develop microstructure-property-                     
              performance relations.
