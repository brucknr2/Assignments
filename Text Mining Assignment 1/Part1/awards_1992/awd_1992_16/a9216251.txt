Abstract    :
                   This award supports a conference entitled: "Workshop on                   
              Crystals and Hodge Theory".  The workshop will be held during                  
              March 1993, in Berkeley, CA.                                                   
                   The workshop will be concerned with recent results in                     
              crystalline cohomology and Hodge theory, covering both geometric               
              and arithmetic applications, as well as fundamental results about              
              "abstract" variations of Hodge structures and crystals.  The                   
              special emphasis will be on the unity between the two fields.
