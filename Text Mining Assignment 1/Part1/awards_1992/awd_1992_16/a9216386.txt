Abstract    :
              Interdisciplinary research in the fields of control                            
              systems, structural dynamics, and materials science                            
              is proposed for damage mitigation and failure                                  
              prognosis of mechanical structures as an                                       
              augmentation to intelligent control and diagnostics                            
              in complex dynamic processes.  The key ideas of                                
              the proposed research are (i) a significant                                    
              improvement in service life could be achieved by a                             
              small reduction in the system dynamic performance;                             
              and (ii) impending failures of critical plant                                  
              components can be predicted in real time.                                      
              Specifically, prognoses of impending component                                 
              failures are critical for enhancement of plant and                             
              personnel safety, improvement of availability and                              
              operability, and reduction of operational cost.  As                            
              the science and technology of materials continue to                            
              evolve, the design methodologies for damage-                                   
              mitigating control and failure prognostics must have                           
              the capability of easily incorporating an appropriate                          
              representation of material properties.  This requires                          
              augmentation of the current system-theoretic and                               
              AI-based techniques for synthesis of decision and                              
              control laws with governing equations and                                      
              inequality constraints that would model the                                    
              properties of the materials for the purpose of                                 
              damage representation and failure prognosis.  The                              
              major challenge in this research is to extract the                             
              information from the material properties and then                              
              utilize this information in a mathematical form for                            
              synthesizing intelligent control and diagnostic                                
              systems.
