Abstract    :
              Scientists, engineers and technical managers often work in teams.              
              The ability to work as part of a team contributes importantly to               
              organizational productivity.  Yet despite a strong tradition of                
              theory and research on groups, little is known about the                       
              acquisition of teamwork skills, especially in technical domains.               
              This research investigates how technical students and professionals            
              learn teamwork in software development.  A theoretical framework               
              for examining individual and group change in coordination behavior             
              and teamwork skills is developed.  Then, studies of the development            
              of teamwork skills in student software development teams are                   
              conducted.  The research examines the effect of students'                      
              experience on changes in team structure and communication, and of              
              how patterns of team coordination are associated with team                     
              performance and with individual performance and cognitive learning.            
              The analysis is then extended to actual organizations with studies             
              of changes in patterns of coordination and learning in software                
              development teams in two organizations.  Two field studies are                 
              conducted:  (1) a cross-sectional study of how coordination                    
              patterns in teams are associated with cognitions and attitudes                 
              about teamwork, and (2) a longitudinal study of socialization for              
              teamwork, examining the influence of experienced group members on              
              changes in the coordination behaviors, cognitions, and attitudes of            
              novices.
