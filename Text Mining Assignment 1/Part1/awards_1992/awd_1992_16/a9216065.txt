Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  The objective of this SGER Program proposal is to test both               
              drifting and moored buoys with a new instrument which measures the             
              ocean heat flux directly.  Typically, these observations are made              
              indirectly in the atmosphere above the ocean surface and are both              
              difficult to make and do not have the desired accuracy.  The new               
              instrument simulates the "membrane" which separates the ocean from             
              the atmosphere and measures the heat flow through it.  The                     
              instrument is simple, can be calibrated from first principles, and             
              will also work in zero wind.                                                   
                                                                                             
                   These properties make it ideally sited for obtaining heat flux            
              observations in the warm pool region of the Pacific as part of the             
              TOGA/COARE, and possibly also the CEPEX, program.  Modelling the               
              boundary layer in this region is especially difficult because most             
              algorithms require a wind.  Observations from these devices could              
              provide key information that should aid in a better understanding              
              of the boundary layer in this region.  The instrument should work              
              well in other parts of the ocean as well.                                      
                                                                                             
                   This research is important because it seeks to improve on                 
              ability to collect information vital to the study of atmosphere-               
              ocean interactions related to climate variability and change.
