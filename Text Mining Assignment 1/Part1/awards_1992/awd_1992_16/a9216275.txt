Abstract    :
                   The investigator continues his mathematical study of                      
              qualitative theory for quasilinear hyperbolic-parabolic partial                
              differential equations, including analysis convection,                         
              compression, shearing, dissipation, and electromagnetism.                      
                   The main goal is to understand the nonlinear stability and                
              instability in waves in the contexts mentioned above.                          
              Applications include  gas dynamics, elasticity, multi-phase flow,              
              magnetohydrodynamics, and combustion.
