Abstract    :
              9216474  Bowen  The objective of the research is to develop generic fuzzy 
              constraint-based architecture for Multiple Agent Process Control.   Among the
              benefits of the project will be:  1.  This project will improve the
              effectiveness of process  control technology by cross-fertilizing research
              results from  fuzzy logic, constraint processing, and process control.  In 
              particular, the project will involve fundamental research aimed  at a)
              developing a new set of control engineering techniques  based on the use of
              constraint network processing to achieve  coordination between multiple agents
              in the control loop; b)  developing new fuzzy constraint network-based process
              control  techniques for handling non-linear systems, complex systems,  adaptive
              systems, and systems with time delays.    2.  This project will enable industry
              to address a broader class  of control application.  In particular, we will a)
              provide the  industrial community with a generic fuzzy constraint network- 
              based architecture for process control; b) use our industrial  contacts to
              achieve a widespread dissemination of information  about this new technology. 
              3.  This project will improve the quality of Engineering  Education by
              incorporating the newly developed fundamental  control engineering techniques
              into graduate and undergraduate  level courses on process control.  ***
