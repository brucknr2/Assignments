Abstract    :
                   This work continues mathematical research into the                        
              asymptotic expansions of certain differential and                              
              pseudodifferential operators.  When one transforms a differential              
              operator by means of a classical transform, the operator often                 
              appears as a multiplier of the transformed solution.  This                     
              multiplier becomes the symbol of the operator.  The asymptotic                 
              expansion of smooth and nonsmooth symbols has been obtained in                 
              different contexts.  One barrier to going further has been the                 
              lack of method of stationary phase for integrls with a nonsmooth               
              amplitude fundtion.  Recent developments now allow one to derive               
              complete expansions for certain classes of discontinuous symbols.              
              It is the purpose of this work to continue in this direction,                  
              taking on more difficult and more interesting cases.  Ultimately               
              one will look for a precise general theory.
