Abstract    :
              This project involves the use of neural networks for adaptive                  
              control of manufacturing processes. A methodology is developed to              
              use neural networks in a parallel computing environment. In                    
              addition, a parallel recursive least squares algorithm is                      
              designed to train recurrent neural networks. Both on-line and                  
              off-line training are accomplished. The methodology is validated               
              by applying it to the problem of controlling the cutting forces                
              in a three-dimensional end milling operation using computer                    
              simulations and laboratory experiments.***    //
