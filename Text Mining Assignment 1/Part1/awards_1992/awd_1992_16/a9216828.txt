Abstract    :
              9216828  Berry-Lowe  A multi-component chromatography system, including fast 
              protein liquid chromatography, will be used for a number of  studies including
              the following:  Purification,  characterization, and site-directed mutagenesis
              of the  enzymes involved in porphyrin synthesis in higher plants;  study of 
              the adaptive mechanisms by which conifers requlate  rates of essential
              metabolic processes as a function of  altitude (malate dehydrogenase will be
              purified and  characterized initially); identification and purification of 
              bacterial proteins involved in localization of lipoproteins  in membranes; and
              protein engineering of a novel yeast  qlucoamylase.  This equipment  will also
              be utilized in  several undergraduate classes by the Biology Department of 
              Colorado Springs:  for demonstrations in lecture courses  (Cell Biology,
              Immunology, Plant Physiology), for hands-on  use in laboratory courses
              (Biochemistry, Biotechnology) and  for hands-on use in research (Independent
              Study, Senior  Thesis).  ***
