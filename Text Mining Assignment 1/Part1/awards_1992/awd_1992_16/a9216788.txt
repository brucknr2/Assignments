Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              A series of laboratory experiments in a wave tank will be conducted            
              to study the non-linear energy transfer to short waves in the                  
              presence of long wave to improve the interpretation of Synthetic               
              Aperture Radar (SAR) remote sensing of ocean surface waves.  The               
              experimental results will be also used to assess the accuracy of               
              new numerical model of wave interactions as well as standard wave              
              theory.
