Abstract    :
              This US-Argentina Cooperative Science award                                    
              will support the collaboration of Ignacio                                      
              Grossmann of Carnegie Mellon University and                                    
              Jaime Cerda of the Universidad Nacional del                                    
              Litoral (UNL), Argentina.  The project aims to                                 
              develop new algorithmic methodologies for                                      
              production planning and scheduling of                                          
              multipurpose batch plants producing                                            
              simultaneously products of low to medium                                       
              demand.                                                                        
                                                                                             
              A goal of these methodologies will be to                                       
              satisfy product demands on time, but also                                      
              minimize idle times and product inventories.                                   
              Another objective will be to develop realistic                                 
              models that account for assignments of groups                                  
              of consecutive tasks to a single equipment                                     
              item, simultaneous production of intermediate                                  
              and finished products, multiple processing                                     
              paths, and setup/changeover times.  To develop                                 
              effective solution methods, models will be                                     
              investigated that do not rely on discretization                                
              of the time domain, and that can be enhanced                                   
              with fast heuristic techniques.  The proposed                                  
              techniques will be implemented within an expert                                
              system shell that can provide for better                                       
              insights and understanding by the user.  This                                  
              project is expected to produce benefits to both                                
              sides that will complement existing research in                                
              optimization and batch processing at Carnegie                                  
              Mellon and UNL.
