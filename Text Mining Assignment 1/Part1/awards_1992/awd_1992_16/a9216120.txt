Abstract    :
                   This award supports a conference entitled: "Numerical                     
              Analysis with Automatic Result Verification: Mathematics,                      
              Applications, and Software".  The conference will be held from                 
              February 25 to March 1, 1993, in Lafayette, Louisiana.  The                    
              conference will be concerned with automatic verification of                    
              computations (interval analysis) in numerical analysis.  The                   
              conference has three goals:                                                    
                   1.  Bringing U. S. researchers up to date on automatic                    
                   verification of computations;                                             
                   2.  Apprising young researchers and graduate students of the              
                   status and technology for automatically verified                          
                   computations;                                                             
                   3.  Providing a forum for interactions between industrial                 
                   mathematicians and researchers in automatically verified                  
                   computations.
