Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This project consists of conducting model experiments of Gulf                  
              Stream eddy formation and evolution using a nested high-resolution             
              model driven by a large-scale, coarser resolution model constrained            
              by high-quality in-situ data.  Both models are extensions of the               
              Harvard ocean model, which is a descendant of the GFDL Bryan-Cox               
              model.  The large scale model will assimilate data from the SYNOP              
              moored array program to provide realistic simulations of Gulf                  
              Stream dynamics, which in turn will provide boundary conditions for            
              the high-resolution (5-km) nested model.
