Abstract    :
              A set of existing informal arrangements for providing assistance in            
              setting up new computer networks in under-networked areas and                  
              linking them to the U.S. will be enhanced and focused on the                   
              particular needs of U.S. scientists traveling to or developing                 
              collaborations with such areas.  The resource center will provide              
              installation tool kits for network software, together with                     
              documentation, advice and information about possible linkages to               
              existing networks and facilities.  It will provide a catalyst and              
              focal point for making textbooks and surplus hardware available to             
              critical individuals and hub facilities from which national and                
              regional network spines might be expected to evolve.  The primary              
              focus will be on proven, time-tested and reliable technology in all            
              areas, with the objective of serving users who are not computer                
              experts.  By building on existing support networks of people                   
              and facilities, the center will accomplish a high leveraging of NSF            
              funds.
