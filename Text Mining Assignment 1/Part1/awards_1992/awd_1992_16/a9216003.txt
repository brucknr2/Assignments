Abstract    :
              This project is in the general area of analytical and surface                  
              chemistry and in the subfield of organic electrochemistry.  During             
              the tenure of this three-year continuing grant, Professor Miller               
              and his students will synthesize various linear and helical                    
              polyacenes containing two or more electrophores, monodisperse                  
              thiophene oligomers, and polyelectrophores.  They will then study              
              the redox chemistry of these entities and the resulting ion                    
              radicals and poly-ions.  These radical ion and poly-ion species                
              will be investigated with particular emphasis on understanding                 
              electron localization in conjugated systems and the effects of                 
              local ordering on the aggregate electronic and chiroptical                     
              properties of these substances.  This research builds upon                     
              accomplishments of the Miller group under the aegis of NSF grant               
              CHE-8717540.

              Results from this research project will extend current                         
              understanding of electron delocalization and contribute                        
              significantly to the developing area of molecular materials.                   
              Additionally, new infrared and near-infrared dyes suitable for use             
              in lasers could evolve directly from this work.
