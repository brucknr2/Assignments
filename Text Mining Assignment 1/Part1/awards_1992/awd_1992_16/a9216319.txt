Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              A theoretical study of the dynamics of ocean boundary currents and             
              their interaction with lateral boundaries will be conducted.  Three            
              cases are studied:  (1)  a flow parallel to a continental slope                
              through a conversing strait; (2)  the evolution of an unstable                 
              barotropic shear layer on the continental slope and (3)  the eddy-             
              jet interaction of the Gulf Stream.
