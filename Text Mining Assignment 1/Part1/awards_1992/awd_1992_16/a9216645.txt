Abstract    :
                   Simple parameterizations of the marine boundary layer are a               
              crucial component of numerical models of weather and climate.  In              
              the tropics and subtropics, tradewind cumulus clouds are by far the            
              most common cloud type.  Parameterizations of trade cumulus cloud              
              fields rely heavily on correctly predicting the vertical mass and              
              moisture fluxes within individual cumulus clouds, yet these                    
              predictions have not been adequately compared with either                      
              observations nor models of individual cumuli.                                  
                   Using data from the previously executed Hawaiian Rainband                 
              Project, the Principal Investigator will analyze dual-Doppler data             
              of trade cumuli in order to determine the vertical profile of                  
              vertical mass fluxes throughout the life cycle of a large number of            
              individual precipitating cumulus clouds.  The Principal                        
              Investigator will utilize a three-dimensional numerical boundary               
              layer cloud model to help in interpretation of the results from the            
              Doppler radars.  He also will compare results from both                        
              observations and the numerical model to currently used                         
              parameterizations of trade cumulus cloud fields.
