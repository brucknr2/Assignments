Abstract    :
              In this project, the PI's team will study the circulation of the               
              North Pacific, from the sea surface to the bottom, and relate it               
              to results from an earlier study of the South Pacific.  These                  
              results will be compared with circulation patterns determined by               
              the PI in the South and North Atlantic, using similar techniques.              
              These will then feed in to studies of the ocean/ocean relations                
              and determination of inter-basin exchange processes.
