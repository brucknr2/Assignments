Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Orientation to and location of distant unseen targets, such as                 
              mates, nest sites or food, can be achieved by tracking odors                   
              emitted by the targets. The path that is traveled through air or               
              water typically exhibits a regular side-to-side zigzagging pattern.            
              In this award to Drs. Edmund Arbas and Mark Willis, control systems            
              will be identified and the manner in which these systems interact              
              and adapt to the unpredictable environmental conditions experienced            
              during pursuit of the goal will be studied. The model system is the            
              male tobacco hornworm moth, which locates its mate by flying up a              
              wind-borne plume of pheromone-attractant released by the female.               
              Flight patterns in a wind tunnel will be recorded by videotaping               
              while electrical activity of the flight muscles is monitored. The              
              results of this research will used as the basis of computer                    
              simulations of the behavior. This work will contribute basic                   
              knowledge about movement control and how it is modulated by                    
              adaptations to the environment.
