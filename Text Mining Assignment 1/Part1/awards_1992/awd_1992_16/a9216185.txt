Abstract    :
              This project consists of a program of research into logical                    
              and complexity theoretic aspects of programming languages.  It                 
              continues an ongoing commitment to the study of type inference                 
              for functional programming languages, together with a                          
              variety of associated topics spanning research questions in                    
              deductive database theory, program transformation methodology,                 
              unification, and type systems for records, objects and linear                  
              programs.  The research program is founded on the belief that                  
              this study of type inference will give deeper understanding of                 
              the computational costs of embedding such mechanisms in a                      
              compiler, thus providing some guidance to language designers                   
              as to what is computationally feasible.  The program is                        
              motivated as well by the belief that the complexity of type                    
              inference provides a precise computational measure of the                      
              expressiveness of programming languages.
