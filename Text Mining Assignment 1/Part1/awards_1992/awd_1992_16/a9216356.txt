Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Funds are provided to defray travel costs of young scientists and              
              invited participants to attend the Conference on Steroid Action                
              on Excitable Cells which is to be held as a Satellite Symposium                
              at the 1993 Society for Neuroscience on November 6, 1993 in                    
              Washington, DC.  Since the 1960's, it has been readily accepted                
              that the mechanism of steroid hormone action is by a genomic                   
              route.  However, in some circumstances, hormones can have effects              
              within seconds to minutes.  Until recently, these data were                    
              ignored because it did not fit the dogma.  Now it has become                   
              clear that steroid action in the brain is more complex than that               
              previously thought.  Indeed, steroid action is mediated by both                
              genomic and non-genomic routes.  The conference will address the               
              mechanisms through which steroid hormones and thyroid hormones                 
              act on excitable cells.  The presentations will highlight the                  
              exciting recent work on (1) the modulatory action of steroid on                
              amino acid receptors in the hippocampus; (2) the use of simple                 
              model systems as means to examine the actions of hormones on                   
              identified, voltage-clamped, ion currents; (3) novel hormone                   
              receptors; and (4) the molecular and biochemical actions of                    
              steroids.  These are fundamentally important questions                         
              in an field that is rapidly advancing and changing.  This                      
              Satellite Symposium offers a forum for sharing of ideas on this                
              subject which may ultimately lead to breakthroughs in                          
              understanding the mechanisms of steroid hormone action.
