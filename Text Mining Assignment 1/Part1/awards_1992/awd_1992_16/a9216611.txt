Abstract    :
                   This award supports the participation of 16 U.S. scientists               
              in a U.S.-Japan Photoconversion/Photosynthesis Seminar on                      
              Molecular Photophysics of Organized Assemblies.  The seminar,                  
              which will be held March 14-18, 1993 in Palm Springs, California               
              is being co-organized by Professor Pill-Soon Song, Department of               
              Chemistry, University of Nebraska, and Dr. Iwao Yamazaki,                      
              Department of Chemical Process Engineering, Hokkaido University,               
              Sapporo, Japan.  The seminar will focus on new aspects of                      
              research in the biophotophysics of photoconversion/                            
              photosynthesis, the biological relevance of newly acquired                     
              information on the structure and dynamics of the excited states                
              of biomolecules and their assemblies (both artificial and                      
              biological systems), and the current understanding of the                      
              molecular mechanisms of light energy conversion and signal                     
              transduction (both signal generation and amplification) in living              
              organisms.  Seminar sessions are organized around the following                
              topics:  photophysics of molecular assemblies, photosynthetic                  
              systems:  primary photoprocesses and electron transfer, magnetic               
              effects and organized molecular magnetism, photoconversion and                 
              photo-signal transduction, and photon energy capture and                       
              transfer.  The goal of the seminar is to provide opportunities                 
              for in-depth discussion, which could lead to further research                  
              collaboration between U.S. and Japanese scientists.
