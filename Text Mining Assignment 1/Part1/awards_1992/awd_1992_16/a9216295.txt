Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                                                                                            
              The few available data suggest that silicon isotopes are                       
              fractionated during the production of opal by marine diatoms.                  
              Variations in silicon isotope ratios will be used to study diatom              
              production and silica cycling in the ocean.  A laser-based system              
              will be used for determining silicon isotope ratios in inorganic               
              and biogenic silicon-bearing phases to evaluate the utility of this            
              approach by determining the fractionation factors for silica                   
              biomineralization and dissolution using cultures of Antarctic and              
              temperature diatom species.
