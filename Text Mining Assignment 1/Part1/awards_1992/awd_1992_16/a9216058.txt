Abstract    :
              This grant provides support for travel funds for                               
              graduate students and post-doctoral fellows to                                 
              attend the 20th International Congress on High                                 
              Speed Photography and Photonics, University of                                 
              Victoria, Victoria, BC, Canada, on September 21-                               
              25, 1992.  This is a venerable international                                   
              conference, dating its inception to the early 1950's,                          
              which provides a forum for discussion of advances                              
              in the rapidly advancing field of high-speed imaging                           
              technologies.  The advent of ultrashort pulse lasers,                          
              of picosecond and now femtosecond time duration,                               
              and concomitant advances in time-resolved methods                              
              of detection has kept this a vibrant field of study,                           
              with strong input both from industry, government                               
              laboratories, and academia.  The International                                 
              Advisory Committee of this Congress has expressed                              
              concern of the limited number of young scientists                              
              and engineers, particularly at the graduate student                            
              and post-doctoral level, who have the financial                                
              resources to attend the International Congress.  To                            
              address this problem, they have approached the                                 
              NSF to provide resources for travel support, with                              
              the intent of using this as leverage to raise                                  
              matching funds from industry groups active in the                              
              field.  This is an opportunity to help raise the                               
              visibility in industry of the need to strengthen the                           
              academic infrastructure and provide for young                                  
              researchers in this important technology field.
