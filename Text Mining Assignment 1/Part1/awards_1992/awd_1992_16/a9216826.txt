Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The PI proposes to undertake field experiments in the region of the            
              Delaware Coastal Current with the goal of investigating the across-            
              shelf mixing of buoyant water from the coastal current into shelf              
              water.  The three major objectives are:  (1)  to identify the                  
              principal physical processes that produce across-shelf mixing, (2)             
              to construct the balance of salt flux for the coastal current from             
              observations of the subtidal current and salinity field, and (3) to            
              obtain a quantitative and statistical significant relationship                 
              between the buoyancy flux (or salt flux) from the coastal current              
              source region and the expected principal forcing agents of river               
              discharge and alongshore wind stress.
