Abstract    :
              This collaborative effort will make use of an extensive and unique             
              data set collected over several years from the Chukchi Sea.                    
              Investigators from three institutions will study the interactions              
              of physical, chemical, and biological processes of the Chukchi Sea             
              ecosystem to define its present and perhaps future trophic status              
              through a series of data and simulation analyses.  The chemical                
              processes associated with biological and physical processes in the             
              Chukchi Sea will be assessed using data from a series of 13 current            
              meter moorings in 1990-1991 and seven bilateral U.S.-U.S.S.R.                  
              cruises during 1988-1991.  The source water concentrations of                  
              nutrients flowing through Bering Strait into the Arctic will be                
              determined on an annual basis for the years 1988-1991 and will be              
              combined with buoyancy flux estimates to calculate nutrient flux               
              estimates.  Nutrient budgets for the Chukchi Sea shelf will be                 
              constructed and compared to subsurface oxygen inventories and                  
              primary production estimates.  In addition, dominant phytoplankton             
              groups will be identified and related to their respective nutrient             
              habitats.  Organic decomposition (regeneration) and respiration                
              processes will be examined using systematic changes in regenerated             
              nutrients and dissolved oxygen.  The work supports the goals and               
              research priorities of the Arctic System Science (ARCSS) program of            
              the Global Geosciences Initiative.
