Abstract    :
              Effective power system operation                                               
              requires well-planned commitments                                              
              of generating units in a planning                                              
              phase combined with responsive                                                 
              real-time dispatching of power in                                              
              an operational control phase.                                                  
              Typically, the unit commitment plan                                            
              is determined by an optimization                                               
              model that considers a forecast for                                            
              demand, fixed security constraints,                                            
              and known unit availabilities.  The                                            
              operational controller considers                                               
              actual random demand, varying                                                  
              security reserves, and unforeseen                                              
              unit losses.  This project will                                                
              combine these tasks by  integrating                                            
              the planning and operating phases                                              
              in a unified control framework.                                                
              The emphasis in the planning phase                                             
              will be on considering random                                                  
              effects, contingencies and the                                                 
              values attributed to potential                                                 
              ending states.  The emphasis on the                                            
              operating phase will be on                                                     
              considering longer term effects,                                               
              recognizing conditions requiring                                               
              corrective actions, searching for                                              
              similar situations and potential                                               
              actions for learning from both                                                 
              practical experience and simulated                                             
              events.
