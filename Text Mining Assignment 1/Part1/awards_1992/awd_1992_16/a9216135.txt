Abstract    :
              This research is devoted to the theoretical analysis of various                
              aspects of the compressive kinking mode of failure in aligned-                 
              fiber composite materials.  Specifically, the research will focus              
              on the relation of width of kink bands to fiber diameter,                      
              stiffness, and tensile fracture strength, matrix plasticity, and               
              fiber misalignment.  The project will also model the initiation                
              and propagation of kink bands form boundaries, notches and holes;              
              and the coupling of other composite damage mechanisms with                     
              kinking an kinking induced damage.
