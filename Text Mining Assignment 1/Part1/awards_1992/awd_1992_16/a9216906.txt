Abstract    :
                   Understanding the interaction of cumulus convection with                  
              larger-scale circulations has been and remains a problem of great              
              importance in atmospheric science.  Currently there are two schools            
              of thought regarding this interaction.  The first (known as CISK)              
              holds that the tropical atmosphere is conditionally unstable and               
              that the large scale circulation determines where and when the                 
              associated available potential energy is released.  The second                 
              purports that convection is in a state of quasi-equilibrium with               
              the large-scale circulation and is responsible for redistributing              
              heat and moisture, but does not constitute an energy source for                
              those circulations.  Theories to explain, among other things, the              
              genesis of tropical cyclones depend on understanding the nature of             
              the interaction between cumulus clouds and the large-scale                     
              environment.                                                                   
                   In 1991, a field experiment known as the Tropical Experiment              
              in Mexico (TEXMEX) was conducted to explore tropical cyclone                   
              genesis in the eastern Pacific.  The unique data collected as part             
              of that experiment will allow Dr. Emanuel, the PI, to explore                  
              fundamental aspects of the genesis problem as well as to gain                  
              insights into the broader question of cumulus and large-scale                  
              circulation interaction.  In addition, the PI will investigate the             
              dynamics of spiral rainbands and concentric eyewalls of tropical               
              cyclones.
