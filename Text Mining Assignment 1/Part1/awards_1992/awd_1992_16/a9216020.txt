Abstract    :
                   This research is concerned with the structure and                         
              representations of algebraic groups and associated finite groups.              
              The principal investigator will establish results on the                       
              structure and embedding of reductive subgroups of simple                       
              algebraic groups;  work on linking the subgroup structure of                   
              finite groups to that of algebraic groups;  study the                          
              representation theory of the symmetric groups over fields of                   
              positive characteristic; and study representations of  finite                  
              groups of Lie type over a field of the defining characteristic.                
                   A group is an algebraic structure with a single operation.                
              It appears in many areas of mathematics, as well as, physics and               
              chemistry.  The fundamental building blocks of finite groups are               
              finite simple groups.  One of the major results in mathematics of              
              the past decade is the classification of the finite simple                     
              groups,  the proof of which would require 10,000 to 15,000                     
              journal pages.  This research is aimed at using this                           
              classification in the study of arbitrary finite groups.
