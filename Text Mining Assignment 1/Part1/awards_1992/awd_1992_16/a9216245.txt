Abstract    :
              The intermediate geometry of carbonyl/Lewis acid complexes in                  
              reactions encompassing nucleophilic addition to saturated                      
              ketones, the conjugate nucleophilic addition to enones, and 2 +                
              4 cycloadditions will be investigated.  By use of carefully                    
              designed adamantone, decalone, and sterically-directed decalone                
              systems, the controlled pi-binding of a variety of Lewis acids                 
              to the carbonyl center will be studied by measuring the extent                 
              of binding and the resultant effect on chemical reactivity. The                
              reaction rates of 1,2- and 1,4- nucleophilic additions and 2 +                 
              4 cycloadditions will be measured for systems in which Lewis                   
              acid binding to the ketone moiety is in-plane with the ketone                  
              as well as via a pi-complex type geometry.  Differences between                
              transition and main group metal based Lewis acid will be                       
              evaluated, and the effect of saturated versus unsaturated                      
              carbonyls on the thermodynamic preference for Lewis acid                       
              complexation geometry will be defined.

              One of the most important aspects of modern chemical research                  
              is to define on a molecular level the factors which accelerate                 
              reactions and provide for clean, efficient generation of                       
              specific targeted products.  This grant from the Organic                       
              Dynamics Program supports the continuing investigation of the                  
              acid catalysis of three important classes of chemical reactions                
              by Professor R. C. Corcoran at the University of Wyoming.  The                 
              investigation is targeted toward synthesis of chemical species                 
              with geometrical constraints that provide specific binding of                  
              metallic acid catalysts. Such processes are critical in                        
              designing new catalysts with increased efficiency,  and will be                
              of significant benefit in controlling synthetic processes of                   
              technical importance.
