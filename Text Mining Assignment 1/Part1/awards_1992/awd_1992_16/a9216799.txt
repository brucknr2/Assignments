Abstract    :
              9216799  Weinreich    This three-year award supports U.S.-France cooperative
              research  between Gabriel Weinreich, University of Michigan, and Xavier 
              Boutillon of the Musical Acoustics Laboratory, University of  Paris VI, in
              computer studies of the dynamics of musical  instruments and the synthesis and
              reproduction of sound.  This  project extends the previous work of the
              investigators on a  digital bow, a computer simulation, where a real physical
              string  is bowed by an electrodynamic force controlled by a ccomputer.   The
              objective of the research is to continue to utilize computer  simulations in
              studying the dynamic processes by which musical  instruments are set and
              maintained in oscillation.    The U.S. investigator brings to this
              collaboration considerable  expertise in basic physics.  This is complemented
              by the French  investigator's work in acoustics and musical instruments.  The 
              mechanical and physical processes of vibrating instruments are  not only of
              interest in the immediate area of musical acoustics,  but also have important
              implications for other fields, such as  structural vibration and mechanics.  
              In addition, the project  addresses problems of replacing parts of a mechanical
              system with  a computer programmed to operate in real time.  These efforts 
              could have important consequences in the general area of digital  control
              systems.  ***
