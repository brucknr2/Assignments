Abstract    :
                   The purpose of this award is to provide travel support for                
              graduate students and a limited number of invited speakers to                  
              participate in a special session on nonlinear dynamics and                     
              predictability in climate and hydrology.  The session is being held            
              as part of the American Geophysical Union's Spring Meeting.                    
                   The role of nonlinear dynamical processes in geophysical                  
              systems has been recognized as one of the key issues which must be             
              understood if we are to improve, or determine the limits of,                   
              predictability of these complex and coupled systems.  Participants             
              in this session will not only review current knowledge, but also               
              will identify future directions for research.
