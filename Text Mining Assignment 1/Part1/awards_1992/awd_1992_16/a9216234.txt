Abstract    :
              The development of sound engineering                                           
              solutions for soil and soil-structure systems is                               
              important in the design and construction of the                                
              material infrastructure that supports human                                    
              lives and the nation's economy: buildings,                                     
              bridges, earth dams, lifelines and tunnels for                                 
              communications and municipal electricity, gas,                                 
              water and sewer systems.  Additional                                           
              challenges are posed by growing environmental                                  
              problems, including the design and construction                                
              of landfills and the evaluation and remediation                                
              of contaminant transport by groundwater.  The                                  
              many uncertainties in the design of such                                       
              facilities are compensated for through                                         
              conservative designs, involving increased cost                                 
              and use of materials.  An alternative approach                                 
              is provided by the testing of physical                                         
              geotechnical models, specifically by                                           
              geotechnical centrifuge model tests.                                           
                                                                                             
              This symposium focusses on the application of                                  
              the geotechnical centrifuge testing technique to                               
              geotechnical, earthquake and environmental                                     
              problems, and it addresses a wide audience of                                  
              researchers and practitioners.                                                 
                                                                                             
              The symposium is the second day of a two-day                                   
              event, which begins with the official                                          
              inauguration of the Rensselaer Polytechnic                                     
              Institute 100 G-ton centrifuge, which has been                                 
              in operation since 1989.
