Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This study attempts to develop a membrane for use in the high                  
              temperature separation of hydrogen from a gaseous mixture. For                 
              high temperature applications, inorganic membranes are                         
              necessary, and palladium and palladium silver alloy metal                      
              membranes exhibit the highest selectivity for hydrogen.  The                   
              problems with these metallic membranes are that temperature or                 
              pressure cycles can cause them to crack, and their surfaces                    
              can be poisoned by sulfur containing molecules in the gaseous                  
              mixture.  To avoid cracking, metallic membranes are usually                    
              fabricated to large thicknesses which imparts a structural                     
              rigidity.  However large membrane thicknesses lower the flux                   
              to the point where the use of thick membranes becomes                          
              economically unattractive.                                                     
                                                                                             
              In order to develop a membrane with high flux and selectivity,                 
              the study suggests forming membranes in which metallic Pd and                  
              Pd/Ag films have been placed inside the pores of a macroporous                 
              ceramic substrate.  Two types of porous ceramic membranes will                 
              be used.   The first is a one layer . alumina disk with a pore                 
              diameter in the range of .2 - .7 m.  The second is a two                      
              layer disk consisting of a thin (5m), small pore (5 nm) layer                 
              lanthana modified y Al2O3 layer atop a thick (1-2 mm), large                   
              pore (.2 - .7 m) . alumina support.  The metal will be placed                 
              in the ceramic support by using a CVD counterdiffusion process                 
              in which PdCl2 or a mixture of PdCl2 and AgBr will diffuse                     
              through the pores from one face of the ceramic support and H2                  
              will diffuse from the opposite face.  When the gases meet                      
              somewhere inside the membrane, the reduction reactions:                        
                             PdCl2(g) + H2(g) --- Pd(s) + 2HCl(g)                            
                                                                                             
                             AgBr(g) + 1/2 H2(g) --- Ag(s) + HBr(g)                          
                                                                                             
              will produce the metal (or metal alloy) which will span the                    
              interstitial space of the pore and form a gas tight layer.                     
              The layers, supported by the ceramic membrane, should be more                  
              durable and less susceptible to chemical attack.
