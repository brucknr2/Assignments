Abstract    :
              An important problem in robotics                                               
              research is how to build a robot                                               
              that can move over steep,                                                      
              irregular, or otherwise rugged                                                 
              terrain in a flexible and agile                                                
              manner.  Because wheeled vehicles                                              
              do not perform well over such                                                  
              terrain, engineers have attempted                                              
              to design legged robotic vehicles                                              
              for this purpose.  The idea is to                                              
              use such vehicles to explore places                                            
              where humans cannot easily go, such                                            
              as the surface of other planets, or                                            
              rugged or dangerous places on                                                  
              earth.  Insects represent an                                                   
              extraordinarily variable life form                                             
              that has the characteristics of                                                
              adaptability and versatility of                                                
              locomotion on land that engineers                                              
              desire.  In this award to Drs. Fred                                            
              Delcomyn, Narendra Ahuja and Mark                                              
              Nelson, a robotic, legged vehicle                                              
              will be modeled after an insect.                                               
              First the control system for                                                   
              locomotion will be designed and                                                
              simulated on a computer.  The                                                  
              unique aspect of the present design                                            
              will be a deliberate adherence to                                              
              the functional operation of the                                                
              insect, especially in its use of                                               
              feedback from sense organs in the                                              
              legs to help it deal with uncertain                                            
              footing.  By building into the                                                 
              robot a rich array of sensory                                                  
              feedback from the legs, this device                                            
              should emulate the versatility and                                             
              adaptability of the insect, and                                                
              impart to the robot the fault-                                                 
              tolerance and agility of the                                                   
              biological system.  This research                                              
              wil contribute to engineering a                                                
              machine which utilizes the                                                     
              biological characteristic of
