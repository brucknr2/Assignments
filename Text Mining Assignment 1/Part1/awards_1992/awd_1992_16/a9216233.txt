              An interdisciplinary team of civil,                                            
              geotechnical and electrical                                                    
              engineers, and urban and regional                                              
              planners will gather essential                                                 
              information on the underground                                                 
              flooding in the Loop of the city of                                            
              Chicago caused by the failure of                                               
              one section of an old freight                                                  
              tunnel on April 13, 1992.  The team                                            
              will collect information on the                                                
              tunnel grid where the event took                                               
              place; soil conditions during and                                              
              after the break; sequence of events                                            
              leading to the failure and                                                     
              subsequent flood; effects of the                                               
              flood on the electric power system                                             
              and other services; buildings and                                              
              structures affected; short and long                                            
              term repair and recovery measures.                                             
              The gathered data will provide                                                 
              benchmarks for testing and                                                     
              improving models for managing the                                              
              urban infrastructure, assessing the                                            
              potential consequences of similar                                              
              failures, and identifying possible                                             
              preventive and remedial measures.
