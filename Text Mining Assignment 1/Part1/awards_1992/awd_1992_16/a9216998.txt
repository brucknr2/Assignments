Abstract    :
              A Gordon Research Conference entitled: "Enzyme Organization and                
              Cell Function" will be held from January 18-22, 1993, in Oxnard,               
              California.  This will be the fourth such conference, the first one            
              being held in 1987 under the old title: "Organization of Metabolic             
              Sequences."  There will be 23 invited speakers, all of whom are at             
              the cutting edge of some aspect of studies on cellular organization            
              and metabolism.  Interactions between enzymes in metabolic                     
              pathways, and structural aspects of macromolecular protein systems             
              will be discussed, which provide us with a better understanding                
              about functional organization inside the cell cytoplasm.  Composite            
              understanding about this aspect of cellular organization depends               
              upon research from an array of different areas.  The conference                
              brings together scientists specializing in disciplines such as                 
              enzymology, cell biology, molecular biology, physical chemistry,               
              protein chemistry, and genetics, as well as researchers from all               
              areas of metabolism including carbohydrate, amino acid, lipid and              
              nucleic acid metabolism, protein synthesis and processing,                     
              organelle biogenesis, cell motility, and protein folding.  The                 
              conference will provide a unique forum in which research scientists            
              can interact professionally, exchange ideas, and gain information,             
              which will benefit their individual research programs.

              The interaction between cytoplasmic enzymes free in the cell                   
              cytoplasm or those in structured protein complexes will be                     
              discussed to gain a better understanding of how the living cell                
              coordinates between catabolic and biosynthetic activities.  Such               
              organizational control is essential for the survival of every cell.
