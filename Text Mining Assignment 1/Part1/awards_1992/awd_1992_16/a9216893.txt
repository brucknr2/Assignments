Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This continuing grant supports U.S.-France cooperative research                
              in astronomy between Kevin Prendergast of Columbia University and              
              Evangelie Athanassoula of the Marseille Observatory.  The                      
              objective of their research is to develop numerical simulations                
              of the formation and evolution of galaxies using a three-fluid                 
              model for the stars, the gas and dark matter. Star formation,                  
              mass loss, wind and supernova heating, and radiative cooling of                
              gas are included in their numerical code.  The investigators                   
              propose to continue their research on dwarf ellipticals and to                 
              extend the numerical code to spiral and giant elliptical                       
              galaxies.  The U.S. investigator brings to this collaboration his              
              expertise in numerical simulations.  This is complemented by the               
              French investigator's experience in coding, debugging and                      
              production.  The project takes advantages of French facilities,                
              which include Cray, Sun, Vax and Microvax computers, and utilizes              
              French software for running these programs.                                    
                                                                                             
              This research project will advance understanding of the formation              
              of galaxies and the structure of the universe. The proposed                    
              numerical techniques are unique and may be used for other                      
              problems in astrophysics.
