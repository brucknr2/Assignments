Abstract    :
                   This award supports a conference entitled: "Lie Group                     
              Representations and Combinatorics".  The conference will be held               
              from 27 to 31 December 1992, on the campus of New Mexico State                 
              University, in Las Cruces.  The conference will acquaint                       
              researchers and graduate students with Lie theory and                          
              combinatorics.  It will disseminate information presently                      
              unfolding about both areas and their application throughout                    
              mathematics.    The major objectives of the conference are:                    
                   1.  Bring an eminent researcher to the geographically                     
                   isolated area of the university;                                          
                   2.  Foster research collaborations between local faculty and              
                   outside participants;                                                     
                   3.  Stimulate ongoing and future research programs.
