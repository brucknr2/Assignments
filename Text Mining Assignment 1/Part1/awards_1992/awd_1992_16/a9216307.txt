Abstract    :
                    The  decrease of the stratospheric ozone layer has resulted              
              in  an  increase  in the amount of harmful ultraviolet  radiation              
              reaching  both terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems.   Recent  data              
              indicates   that  this  phenomenon  will  also  affect   tropical              
              ecosystems. Tropical ecosystems have a long evolutionary  history              
              of   exposure  to  fluxes  of  UV  radiation,  and  can   provide              
              considerable  insight  into  evolved  mechanisms  of   protection              
              against the deleterious effects of UV radiation.  We presently do              
              not  know  with  confidence the wave length-dependent  efficiency              
              (action  spectrum) of UV radiation for any physiological function              
              in symbiotic cnidarians.   Widespread coral bleaching events have              
              recently  been  observed following anomolously high  sea  surface              
              temperatures  around the world.  If UV radiation  synergistically              
              interacts  with increased sea water temperatures, action  spectra              
              will  be required to predict what dose of UV radiation can induce              
              bleaching,  with or without an increase in sea water temperature.              
              An  important step in understanding the bleaching  phenomenon  is              
              to   determine  the  independent  and  synergistic   effects   of              
              temperature,   visible  radiation,  and  UV  radiation   on   the              
              functional biology of symbiotic associations.
