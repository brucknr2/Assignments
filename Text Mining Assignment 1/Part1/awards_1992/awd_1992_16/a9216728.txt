Abstract    :
                   This project will support four workshops to encourage and                 
              support young women mathematicians.  The first and third                       
              workshops will be held immediately prior to the Joint Meetings of              
              the American Mathematical Society (AMS) and the Mathematical                   
              Association of America (MAA) in January 1993 in San Antonio and                
              January 1994 in Cincinnati, respectively.  The second and fourth               
              workshops will be held immediately prior to the national meeting               
              of the Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics (SIAM) in                
              July 1993 in Philadelphia and July 1994 in San Diego,                          
              respectively.                                                                  
                   These workshops will bring together women who are recent                  
              doctoral recipients or graduate students in mathematics, and                   
              several established mathematicians.  Each workshop will involve                
              approximately ten recent doctoral recipients who will present                  
              thirty minute talks on their research, aimed at a general                      
              mathematics audience.  The graduate students will present their                
              research projects in a less formal poster session.  The workshop               
              participants will be selected by a panel of mathematicians on the              
              basis of a competitive application process,  It is expected that               
              the opportunity to meet and interact with one another, as well as              
              with a few established mathematicians, will enable the                         
              participants to promote their own research, to increase their                  
              professional contacts, and to increase their commitment to                     
              research.
