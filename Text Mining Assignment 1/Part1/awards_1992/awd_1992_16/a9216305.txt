Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This three-year award supports U.S.-France cooperative research                
              in population and evolutionary genetics between Daniel L. Hartl,               
              Harvard University, and Jean R. David, Biology and Evolutionary                
              Genetics Laboratory, the French National Center for Scientific                 
              Research in Gif-sur-Yvette, France.  The research focuses on the               
              evolutionary genetics of  the transposable element mariner                     
              among species of Drosophila.  The investigators will study the                 
              rates and patterns of sequence evolution to determine the mode                 
              of inheritance of these elements in different lineages of                      
              Drosophila.  The transposable element in mariner makes it a                    
              very strong candidate for genetic engineering by means of                      
              germline transformation.  The element is short and has a simple                
              sequence organization.  Mariner sequences are found in a wide                  
              range of genomes.                                                              
                                                                                             
              The U.S. investigator brings to this collaboration expertise in                
              cloning, sequencing and analysis of the mariner elements.  The                 
              French group has an internationally recognized collection of                   
              Drosophila species.  They will carry out the Drosophila screening              
              of mariner elements and some of the cloning and sequencing.                    
              The project will provide data on the evolutionary biology of the               
              transposable mariner element and may assist in the development                 
              of new tools for genetic manipulation of diverse organisms.
