Abstract    :
              The objective of this research is                                              
              to uncover the neural strategies                                               
              utilized by the mammalian brain for                                            
              dynamic optimization and control of                                            
              motor output in a specific motor                                               
              task.  The investigator will study                                             
              the neural computation algorithms                                              
              underlying the adaptive control of
