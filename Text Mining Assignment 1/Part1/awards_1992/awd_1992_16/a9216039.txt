Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Experiments using a novel and innovative technique for mapping                 
              specific photoreceptor activities in the cerebral cortex are                   
              designed to provide answers to crucial questions about the way in              
              which color information is processed at the highest levels of the              
              visual pathway.  These studies should help to resolve a long                   
              outstanding problem in human vision and pioneer a fairly                       
              straightforward technique for the study of most other visual systems           
              that use color information in guiding behavior.  This is the first             
              such attempt to use cone photoreceptor-isolating stimuli to map                
              activity in the primary visual cortex using the metabolic marker, 2-           
              deoxyglucose and promises to be a very powerful new addition to                
              understanding cortical mechanisms of color perception.
