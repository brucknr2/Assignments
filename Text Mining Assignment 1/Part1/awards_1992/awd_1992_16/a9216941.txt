Abstract    :
                This is a Small Grant for Exploratory Research (SGER) to apply               
              existing techniques in parallel processing to the problem                      
              ofplanning with multiple agents.  A model is designed which allows             
              a view of the problem as a sequence of interleaved tree search and             
              satisfaction steps.  The research investigates various factors                 
              influencing the performance of this model when the search and                  
              constraint satisfaction are performed on parallel computers.  These            
              factors include partitioning the plan generation process among                 
              various processors, the nature of various distributed data                     
              structures and the effect of ordering heuristics on complexity of              
              search space.  The new models developed are implemented and                    
              validated on the new generation CM% and the nCUBE2 parallel                    
              computers.
