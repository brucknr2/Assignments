Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                                                                                            
              A numerical model of the wind-forced circulation of the Indian                 
              Ocean will be coupled with a photosynthesis-irradiance model to                
              investigate the intense upwelling and associated primary production            
              that is observed in the northwestern Arabian Sea during the                    
              southwest monsoon.  Extensions of the model are underway to include            
              explicit mixed-layer processes.  The newly constructed                         
              photosynthesis-irradiance model will be coupled to the physical                
              model to allow a more indepth investigation of the upwelling                   
              process and its effect on sea surface temperature (SST), biological            
              primary production, and the oceanic carbon budget in this region.              
              The coupled model will provide a mechanism for integrating                     
              satellite altimeter, SST and ocean color data into a common                    
              coherent framework for analysis and interpretation.  The model will            
              be used in the design of the forthcoming JGOFS Arabian Sea Process             
              Study by quantifying the expected variability, using model data to             
              test sampling schemes, and by providing "quick-look" estimates of              
              present conditions.  The model will also be useful in the analysis             
              of observations, allowing interpretation of point measurements in              
              a broader framework in both space and time.
