Abstract    :
                   This Institutional Infrastructure award is for the support of             
              research projects in experimental and implementation aspects of                
              distributed and parallel computing.  The funds will support the                
              acquisition of a parallel computer and for the support staff to                
              maintain it.  The research supported includes systems and                      
              programming issues for parallel machines, parallel algorithms, and             
              dynamic visualization.                                                         
                                                                                             
                   The High Performance Computing, Communications and Information            
              Technology initiative recognizes as important to the nations future            
              the development of new architecture computers to solve problems                
              which now cannot be solved on computers.  This infrastructure award            
              gives the University of California, Santa Barbara the equipment                
              necessary to participate in this research initiative.
