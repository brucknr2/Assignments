Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                                                                                            
              This award is to provide travel fellowships to young American                  
              scientists to participate in an international symposium on avian               
              endocrinology to be held in Edinburgh, Scotland on September                   
              14-17th, 1992.  State-of-the-art lectures will be held on a broad              
              spectrum of topics from molecular to behavioral endocrinology.  The            
              emphasis of the symposium is on the integration of molecular                   
              approaches with the organismal level of analysis.  In addition, the            
              forum is organized to encourage and promote the interchange of                 
              ideas between the young scientists and well-established, senior                
              investigators from all over the world.  Indeed a goal is to bring              
              together the researchers that are developing molecular probes with             
              those that can provide insights as to potential experimental                   
              applications of these tools.  Some very important initial                      
              discoveries have been made using avian model systems because it is             
              in these species that molecular, cellular, behavioral, and                     
              ecological aspects of hormone action are best integrated.  The                 
              integration from molecular to organismic levels could lead to a                
              better understanding of basic mechanisms underlying physiology and             
              behavior.  The proceedings will be published in a book.
