Abstract    :
              This research project deals with the identification of discrete                
              event system (DES) dynamics for synthesis of supervisory                       
              intelligent controllers. Such systems represent a complex plant's              
              behavior by modeling it as a sequence of logical events, e.g., a               
              computer disk control system. The supervisory controller is a DES              
              controlling a hybrid system. Investigation of efficient methods                
              for obtaining DES plant models are carried out in this project.                
              Specific techniques used include the optimal designs of state                  
              space partitions defining the observed events using inductive                  
              inference procedures, with an emphasis on relatively low                       
              computational burden and reduced sample complexity.***   //
