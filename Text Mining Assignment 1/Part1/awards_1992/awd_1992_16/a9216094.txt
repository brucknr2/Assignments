Abstract    :
              This workshop on "Artificial Intelligence in Real-Time" is aimed               
              at examining how AI systems can both be supported and can help to              
              support real-time operating systems.  This area is of critical                 
              importance as AI systems need to function in the support of such               
              critical applications as nuclear power plant control, aircraft                 
              operation, hospital life support systems, and military command                 
              and control, among others.  The workshop, to be held at the                    
              University of Maryland in the Fall of 1992, brings together                    
              members of both AI and real-time communities to explore issues of              
              mutual interest.  A report, produced by this workshop, will aid                
              in the planning activities of the KMCS, RMI, and ITO Programs.                 
              according to NSF Manual 10,122.1.3 (b), such proposals are exempt              
              from peer review.
