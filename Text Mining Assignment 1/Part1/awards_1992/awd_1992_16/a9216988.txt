Abstract    :
              This US-Brazil Cooperative Science award will                                  
              support research collaboration by David Latham                                 
              of the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory                                   
              and Luiz da Costa of the Observatorio Nacional                                 
              de Brasil in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.  The                                      
              project aims to complete a wide-angle survey of                                
              galaxy redshifts in the Southern Hemisphere and                                
              a survey of distances for a sample of early-                                   
              type galaxies in both galactic caps.                                           
                                                                                             
              By conducting the wide-angle survey, the                                       
              collaborators will map out the large-scale                                     
              structure of the nearby universe to a magnitude                                
              limit of Bo = 15.5.  The survey of distances                                   
              associated with early-type galaxies will enable                                
              the researchers to map out large-scale velocity                                
              flows and density fields in the nearby                                         
              universe.  Both the US and the Brazilian sides                                 
              will contribute their expertise to the                                         
              processes of observation, data reduction, and                                  
              analysis of results.  Their research will                                      
              likely lead to mutual benefits by contributing                                 
              to knowledge of large-scale structures and                                     
              velocity flows in the nearby universe.
