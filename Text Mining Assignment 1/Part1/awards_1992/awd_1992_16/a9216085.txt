Abstract    :
              This support will allow access for each research and teaching to               
              an important collection of more than 14,400 vascular plants from               
              North America, northern South America and the Galapagos.  Many of              
              the plants were collected during surveys of the American west                  
              (Grand Canyon) and the southeast, and the important vouchers for               
              studies of the ecology and feeding behavior of mammals that were               
              the subject of those surveys.  The plants from the Galapagos are               
              a rare international resource.  Incorporation of this collection               
              into the main Herbarium at the Tulane University will enhance                  
              research and teaching activities in botanical disciplines.
