Abstract    :
                   The lectures are named in honor of Professor Emeritus A. H.               
              Clifford of Tulane University.  The Clifford Lectures bring                    
              together mathematicians and students in what has become a vital                
              part of mathematics at Tulane University and other universities                
              of the South.  In the past the Lectures have concentrated on a                 
              particular area of mathematics which changed from year to year.                
              In 1993 the Lectures will involve many areas of mathematics.                   
              Professor Diaconis will present a series of talks entitled                     
              "Geometry and Randomness" which will develop and use mathematics               
              in the fields of geometry, probability, and algebra.  The                      
              Clifford Lectures 1993 will be held March 29 - April 2, at Tulane              
              University.
