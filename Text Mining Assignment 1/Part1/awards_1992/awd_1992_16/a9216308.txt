Abstract    :
              9216308  Alvarado  This research concerns topics in  sparse matrices.  The first
              is the  use of iterative methods based on  approximate partitioned inverses 
              (the explicit inverses of the L and  U factors of A) used as  preconditioners
              for iterative  solvers.  Another research topic is  sparse matrix
              primitization: it is  possible to enlarge the size of a  sparse matrix and
              improve its  condition number as well as reduce  computation and enhance 
              parallelism.  A third topic is on-  the-fly compensation.  This uses  one of
              several variants of the  Matrix Inversion Lemma.  The fourth  research topic is
              a further look  into ordering algorithms.  Of  particular interest is the 
              investigation of methods suitable  for augmented eigenvalue  formulations and
              for orthogonal  factorization.  ***
