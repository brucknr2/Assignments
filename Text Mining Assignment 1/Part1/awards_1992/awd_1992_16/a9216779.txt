Abstract    :
                   This award supports a conference entitled: "A Conference on               
              Quantum Topology".  The conference will be held from 24 to 28                  
              March 1993, on the campus of Kansas State University, in                       
              Manhattan, Kansas.  The conference will be concerned with                      
              interactions between low-dimensional topology (especially                      
              conformal field theory, topological field theory and quantum                   
              gravity), quantum field theory, statistical mechanics, and the                 
              theory of quantum groups.  The conference will feature two series              
              of lectures, by two eminent mathematicians, with additional                    
              invited speakers and contributed talks.
