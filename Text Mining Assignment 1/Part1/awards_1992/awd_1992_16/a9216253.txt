Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Description: This project provides for the                                     
              collaboration between Dr. Sethu Raman, of the                                  
              Department of Marine, Earth and Atmospheric                                    
              Sciences at North Carolina State University                                    
              (NCSU), Raleigh, and Dr. A. Prabhu of the                                      
              Centre for Atmospheric Sciences at the Indian                                  
              Institute of Science (ISc)in Bangalore.  They                                  
              plan to study the atmospheric boundary layer                                   
              and the land surface processes in the tropics                                  
              with special emphasis on applications to                                       
              agriculture and air pollution meteorological                                   
              aspects and climate modeling.  Specific                                        
              objectives are:  study the mean and turbulent                                  
              structure of convective boundary layer in the                                  
              tropics; study the mean and turbulent structure                                
              of the nocturnal boundary layer in the tropics                                 
              which is normally associated with stable                                       
              conditions with very limited diffusion and can                                 
              lead to high ground concentrations of                                          
              pollutants; study the evapo-transpiration                                      
              processes under different crop and planetary                                   
              boundary layer (PBL) conditions; study the                                     
              effect of the changes in the coriolis parameter                                
              on the PBL processes with particular emphasis                                  
              on the nocturnal layer; and determine methods                                  
              of incorporating these processes in mesoscale                                  
              numerical methods.                                                             
                                                                                             
              Scope:  The two scientists have been                                           
              interacting for about four years including a                                   
              sabbatical by Dr. Raman at the IISc.  They both                                
              have extensive qualifications in the research                                  
              topics, and the two institutes have extensive                                  
              capabilities to support the research.                                          
              Bangalore has recently been selected by the                                    
              Government of India for establishing a national                                
              center for boundary layer studies with a 300                                   
              meter tower, which should aid this research.                                   
              The area of study is useful in predicting                                      
              diffusion of pollutants under various                                          
              conditions, and should be of benefit to the                                    
              U.S. and India.
