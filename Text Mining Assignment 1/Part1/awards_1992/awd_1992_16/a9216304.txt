Abstract    :
              This project is in the general area of analytical and surface                  
              chemistry and in the subfield of biosensors.  During the tenure of             
              this three-year continuing grant, Professor Rechnitz and his                   
              students will continue the development of tissue based biosensors              
              using plant and animal tissue materials as molecular recognition               
              elements in conjunction with a variety of transducers.  This                   
              research, which was begun under NSF grant CHE-8921156, will focus              
              on two novel initiatives.  In the first, genetically modified                  
              plant tissue materials will be used in order to achieve improved               
              sensor stability and to extend the range of possible analytes.  In             
              the second, biomagnetic current probes will be introduced as                   
              transducers in the design of neuronal biosensors.  It is expected              
              that such probes could function as non-invasive transducers and                
              thereby improve the useful lifetimes of chemoreceptor based                    
              biosensors.                                                                    
              %%%                                                                            
              This research is aimed at overcoming some of the major technical               
              problems encountered in biosensor research and, more importantly,              
              to introduce and provide conceptual advances for the future                    
              development of analytical biosensors.
