Abstract    :
                 The aim of this SGER proposal is to isolate clones for                      
              cytoplasmic dynein chains from a budding yeast (S. cerevisiae)                 
              genomic library, with the long term aim of studying molecular                  
              aspects of dynein structure and function.  Degenerate primers and              
              PCR have generated a 300 bp probe that appears to hybridize with               
              dynein cDNA. The project calls for the further characterization of             
              the genomic clones that hybridize with the probe.  A series of                 
              restriction maps are planned to determine whether these clones                 
              actually encode yeast dynein(s). The second major aim of the                   
              project is to generate a null mutation in diploid yeast cells to               
              assess the role of the gene product in growth, cell division, and              
              mating. The experiments are carefully-planned, well-controlled and             
              provide alternative strategies in the event that the primary plan              
              of attack is unsuccessful.                                                     
              %%%                                                                            
                 The significance of this work is potentially high because this              
              work could alter our understanding of the molecular structure of               
              this immense mechanochemical protein complex in ways that have been            
              impossible thusfar. The risk in this project is fairly evident; it             
              is not at all clear that budding yeast requires significant levels             
              of dynein to survive.  The functional studies involving the null               
              mutant(s) may be totally equivocal.  Another possibility is that               
              null mutations for cytoplasmic dynein could be lethal.  If the null            
              mutants survive, but fail to develop properly, the role for a                  
              cytoplasmic dynein may be finally established.  This is an                     
              important project that entails a high risk, but has a potentially              
              significant payoff.
