Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                                                                                             
                                                                                             
                                                                                            
              This project is designed to redress the scarcity of information on             
              the composition, structure and cycling of compounds of marine                  
              sedimentary organic-P.  Standard methods for isolating soluble                 
              organic-P are being coupled with analytical pyrolysis of the                   
              insoluble macromolecular fraction of organic-P, chromatographic                
              (HPLC, GC) and direct spectroscopic (31P-NMR,MS) methods to                    
              characterize organic-P compounds in marine pore waters and                     
              sediments.  Chemical structure and composition dictate whether                 
              organic-P compounds are labile or refractory with respect to                   
              microbially mediated degradation, and control recycling of                     
              sedimentary organic-P into the water column.  Composition and                  
              chemical structure will therefore, in large part, control the                  
              ultimate burial rate of refractory organic-P.  Construction of a               
              material balance for the sedimentary organic-P reservoir based on              
              detailed compositional/structural information of constituent                   
              organic-P compounds will permit documentation of the                           
              remineralization of the labile versus the refractory organic-P                 
              reservoirs.
