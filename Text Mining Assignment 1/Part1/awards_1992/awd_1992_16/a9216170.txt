Abstract    :
              This project will investigate and develop                                      
              optoelectronic logic devices that operate in the                               
              visible spectrum.  These devices will be fabricated                            
              from combinations of InGaP, InGaAlP and GaAs;                                  
              materials that have not previously been used for                               
              optoelectronic logic applications.  The device                                 
              structures will be fabricate from epitaxial layers                             
              grown by gas source molecular beam epitaxy.  The                               
              primary objective of this project is to determine if                           
              the above materials are suitable for the                                       
              development of visible spectrum optoelectronic                                 
              devices since there are presently no reported                                  
              optical logic gates that operate in this wavelength                            
              range.  The potential impact of the development of                             
              visible spectrum optical logic devices fabricated                              
              from the InGaP/InGaAlP/GaAs material system is                                 
              great.  Not only could it open up new research in                              
              the area of visible spectrum optoelectronic devices,                           
              which will provide smaller, more sensitive pixels,                             
              but these materials are also a possible replacement                            
              for heterojunction bipolar transistor and the p                                
              channel MODFET which are presently fabricated                                  
              from AlGaAs/GaAs.
