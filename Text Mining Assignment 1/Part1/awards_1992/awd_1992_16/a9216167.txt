              An x-ray diffractometer is an instrument used to measure the                   
              precise structure of a chemical compound, or molecule.  Distances              
              between the atoms in a molecule are measured to a precision of                 
              about 0.1 picometers (there are 1,000,000,000,000 picometers in one            
              meter; one meter is about three feet).  X-ray diffraction                      
              measurements also give precise information about the relative                  
              location and orientation of a given molecule to the other                      
              neighboring molecules in the single crystal.
