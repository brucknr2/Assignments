Abstract    :
                   The objective of the research is to investigate the use of                
              analytic methods and results from multiprocessor computing to                  
              design the most effective integration structures.  The scope of                
              this research will include integration of distributed engineering              
              tasks involving decisions and designs in the areas of distributed              
              product design, production planning and quality assurance.                     
              Distribution will be considered within and between plants and under            
              dynamically changing conditions.  The research will focus on the               
              theoretical analysis of models for three interrelated integration              
              issues:  (1)  static and dynamic organizational configurations for             
              the integration; (2)  decomposition of engineering problems to                 
              tasks that are designed for integration by the above                           
              configurations; and (3)  suitable classification and an analytic               
              approach to compare integration alternatives that will increase                
              integration effectiveness, including fault-tolerant computer-based             
              integration.  To achieve the objective, a multi-disciplinary                   
              approach will be used, combining manufacturing engineering,                    
              operations research, and computer engineering.  The potential of               
              creating significant new knowledge on integration of distributed               
              engineering tasks and influencing its usefulness to American                   
              manufacturing is high.
