Abstract    :
              This project deals with the control of discrete-event                          
              systems(DES) which are characterized by event-driven dynamics                  
              through which jobs contend for resources. Typical examples of                  
              these systems include production, communication, transportation                
              and service systems. Since a major objective of DES control is                 
              the coordination of complex interactions among a large number of               
              individually simple operations, an effective intelligent control               
              can be implemented through a set of simple distributed rules.                  
              This project integrates the concepts from control of stochastic                
              processes and the analysis of greedy algorithms in combanitorial               
              optimization. Additional work includes the extensions of monotone              
              structure to a broader class of DES, an investigation into                     
              distributed, token-based realization of controls, and an                       
              examination of the duplication of monotone structure for                       
              supervisory control in deterministic setting, and system                       
              stability in a stochastic setting.*** //
