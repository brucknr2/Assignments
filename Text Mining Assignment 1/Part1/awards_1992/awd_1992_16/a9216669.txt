Abstract    :
              An investigation for, and subsequent design of                                 
              a high speed, high contrast, semiconductor                                     
              spatial light modulator (SLM) is proposed.                                     
              The SLM uses polarization rotation in a                                        
              MQW under built-in uniaxial stress.  The                                       
              ordinarily strained MQWs are pattern with                                      
              stripe forms to induce an anisotropy in the                                    
              absorption.  The MQW structures then are                                       
              sandwiched between two linear polarizers                                       
              similar to liquid crystal SLMs.  the "on" and                                  
              "off" states are controlled with an applied                                    
              voltage.  The contrast ratio, which is                                         
              determined by the quality of the polarizers,                                   
              can reach as high as 1000: 1; which the                                        
              modulation speed, which is determined by                                       
              electro-absorption in the heterostructures, can                                
              reach the picosecond range.                                                    
                                                                                             
              The proposal represents a two-year                                             
              collaboration between the Department of                                        
              Electrical and Computer Engineering at                                         
              Rutgers University and the Electronics                                         
              Technology and Devices Laboratory (ETDL)                                       
              at Fort Monmouth.  The work at Rutgers will                                    
              focus on processing development, structural                                    
              characterization, and theoretical modeling.  In                                
              addition, a graduate student from Rutgers will                                 
              spend and majority of her time at ETDL,                                        
              performing the optical studies for this project.                               
              The National Science Foundation's support                                      
              will greatly enhance our joint efforts in this                                 
              area.
