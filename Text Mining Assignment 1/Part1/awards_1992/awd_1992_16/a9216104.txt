Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                                                                                            
              Scripps Institution of Oceanography will undertake a collaborative             
              instrument development project to develop, construct, and test a               
              low-cost, three-axis tiltmeter which can be easily deployed for                
              long durations of up to two years on the seafloor to measure                   
              crustal deformation.  The new sensors will employ precision optical            
              detection technology to measure the deflection of a small pendulum             
              with a precision of 1 microradian and very small drift.  The entire            
              unit including data logger will be housed in a pressure case.  An              
              array of these new tilt sensors would be needed for scientific                 
              experiments along mid-ocean ridges where volcanic activity deforms             
              the crust of the seafloor and hence tilts the sensors.  The amount             
              and direction of tilt then provides information on subsurface                  
              volcanic activity.  Such information has been deemed important for             
              planned long-term seafloor observatories associated with the RIDGE             
              global change research program.
