Abstract    :
                   This proposal request funding for a workshop to evaluate the              
              state of our understanding of earthworm ecology in North America.              
              The earthworm fauna and their role in ecosystem function in the                
              western hemisphere are poorly known compared with other regions of             
              Earth, especially Europe and Oceania.  Although it is widely                   
              recognized that earthworms can exert significant influence on                  
              physical, chemical and biological processes in soils, it is not                
              clear how generally results from other biogeographic regions apply             
              to ecological conditions and earthworm assemblages (particularly               
              native earthworm fauna) prevalent in North America.                            
              The focus of this workshop will be on the influence of earthworms              
              on soil processes in forest, rangeland and crop ecosystems over the            
              range of climatic and soil conditions that occur in North America,             
              including Canada and Alaska, the continental U.S., Mexico, and the             
              Caribbean islands.  Investigators from each region will be invited             
              to participate (total of ca.  30 people).  Objectives are to                   
              evaluate our current understanding and to chart future research                
              needs in four topic areas:  1)  systematics and biodiversity; 2)               
              biogeography 3) ecosystem processes; and 4) management                         
              implications.  The final product of the workshop will be a peer-               
              reviewed volume containing final position papers in each topic area            
              and short contributions based on poster presentations.  This volume            
              will be a state-of-the-art resource for research, teaching and                 
              application.
