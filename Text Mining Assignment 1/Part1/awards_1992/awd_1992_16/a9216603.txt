Abstract    :
                   This award supports a continuing series of conferences                    
              focusing on research in the area of several complex variables.                 
              The first meeting was held in 1979 and has met twice every year                
              since except when there were major meetings serving the same                   
              purpose.  Seven universities share the responsibilities of                     
              hosting the meetings. They all have strong research traditions in              
              several complex variables.  The meetings usually run one or two                
              days.                                                                          
                   Emphasis is placed on supporting local graduate students                  
              and speakers from outside the midwest region.  They will receive               
              a major share of the funds.  A small reserve will be maintained                
              for regional faculty who cannot provide for their own                          
              transportation or other expenses.
