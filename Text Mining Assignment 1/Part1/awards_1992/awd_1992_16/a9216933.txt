Abstract    :
              This U.S.-Mexico award will support an exchange                                
              program in representation theory between U.S.                                  
              and Mexican mathematicians, organized by Prof.                                 
              Edward Green of Virginia Polytechnic University                                
              and Prof. Raymundo Bautista of the Mathematics                                 
              Institute of the National Autonomous University                                
              of Mexico (UNAM). About 12 researchers from the                                
              U.S., including some of the leading researchers                                
              in the area of group and algebra                                               
              representations, will participate in a series                                  
              of visits and mini-conferences with leading                                    
              Mexican mathematicians in the subject.                                         
                                                                                             
              Group representation theory is of interest, not                                
              only to algebraists but also topologists and                                   
              other mathematicians.  It is an area of much                                   
              current activity where the computer is                                         
              increasingly used as a tool to generate                                        
              examples and test conjectures.  This U.S.-                                     
              Mexico award will serve to enable further                                      
              collaboration between outstanding                                              
              mathematicians of both countries.
