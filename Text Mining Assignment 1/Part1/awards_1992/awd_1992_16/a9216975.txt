Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  This research addresses practical and theoretical issues                  
              encountered in the lossy compression of information.  The problem              
              of successive refinement, or progressive transmission, concerns                
              efficient approaches to incremental specification of data produced             
              by an information source in order to render it in more detail at               
              each of several encoding stages.  A prime theoretical issue is the             
              determination of conditions under which this can be done in such a             
              way the total data rate required is no less than that needed by                
              someone tasked with only the final rendering in the sequence                   
              without the requirement of generating the intermediate versions.               
              Practical algorithms inspired by theoretical advances in universal             
              lossless data compression, especially the Lempe-Ziv and arithmetic             
              coding formalisms, have profoundly affected the way text and data              
              files are compressed for transmission and storage.  Analogous                  
              theoretical issues and practical techniques are sought for                     
              universal lossy data compression based on searching the imprecisely            
              described past for an approximate rather than an exact match of the            
              next segment of the yet-to-be-encoded data.  the results should                
              significantly impact the way actual data sources, especially images            
              and video, get encoded in practice.
