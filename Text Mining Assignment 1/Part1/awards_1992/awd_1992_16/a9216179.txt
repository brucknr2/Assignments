Abstract    :
              The proposal requests funding for some of expenses to permit                   
              the PI to accept Swiss financial assistance for the                            
              performance of experimental research at the Paul Scherrer                      
              Institute in Switzerland. The research concerns solar powered                  
              chemical reactors for the formation of nitrides from                           
              carbothermic reduction of the corresponding oxide under a                      
              nitrogen atmosphere. Among candidate materials of commercial                   
              importance are AIN, Si3N4, TaN, TiN, and ZrN. Reactions for                    
              the formation of these compounds occur at high temperatures,                   
              hence require high quality heat sources.  Solar-powered                        
              reactions would lead to considerable energy savings. As many                   
              of these processes will be studied as time allows.
