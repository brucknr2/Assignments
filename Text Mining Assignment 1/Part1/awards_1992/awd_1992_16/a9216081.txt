Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This study is a combined theoretical and physical study of the                 
              style of convection beneath mid-ocean ridges using laboratory and              
              numerical fluid dynamics experiments.  Laboratory studies at the               
              University of Rhode Island will involve an apparatus that uses                 
              mylar sheets to model the motion of surface plates.  Buoyancy will             
              be provided by cooling along the top of the tank and either the                
              injection of fluids with different compositional densities or                  
              localized heating along the base of the tank.  Numerical                       
              experiments will simulate 3-D thermal and compositional convection,            
              with constant and variable viscosity, plate driven and buoyant                 
              flow, (2) the formation and evolution of longitudinal convection               
              rolls in thermal and compositional convection, (3) the effect of               
              segmentation on convection, and (4) the role of deep mantle sources            
              of buoyancy.
