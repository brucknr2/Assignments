Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Computing hardware in the Department of Astronomy at Cornell                   
              University supports diverse research in theoretical and                        
              observational space science and astrophysics.  At present the local            
              SUN-based network includes an obsolete server and obsolete 3/50                
              workstations that must be replaced.  Increased network traffic                 
              requires purchase of an additional terminal server.  An extra hard             
              disk drive is needed to handle the data processing of large data               
              sets using AIPS, IRAF, and other software packages.
