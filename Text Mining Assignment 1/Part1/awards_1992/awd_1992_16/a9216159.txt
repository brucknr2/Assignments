              This project provides international                                            
              travel support for the principal                                               
              investigator to conduct cooperative                                            
              studies in Japan and Taiwan on a                                               
              short-term scientific visit basis.                                             
              The investigator will:  (1) work                                               
              with Tokyo University researchers                                              
              on seismic stability problems as a                                             
              follow-up to a previously held                                                 
              joint seminar on the subject, and                                              
              (2) engage in preliminary study on                                             
              the enhancement of damping

              combined to be carried out in a                                                
              single trip to the Far East during                                             
              the Summer of 1992.                                                            
                                                                                             
              The studies will improve                                                       
              engineering understanding of two
