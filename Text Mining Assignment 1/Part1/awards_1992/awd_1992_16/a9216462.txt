Abstract    :
              The primary emphasis of this project is on the use of artificial               
              neural networks (ANNs) for identification and control of unknown               
              nonlinear dynamic systems. However, generally much is known about              
              the plant. This research involves the use of a "gray layer" which              
              facilitates the integration of known characteristics of the                    
              otherwise unknown plant into an ANN. The convergence                           
              characteristics using this novel technique are of several orders               
              of magnitude better than the conventional schemes. Both state of               
              the art intelligent control and adaptive control technologies are              
              used, and their application is demonstrated in the context of                  
              electrically commutated machines.***   //
