Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This study will determine the role of oblique subduction along the             
              Cascadia convergent margin.  Role of small block rotation,                     
              assessment of displacement rates and causes if faults and folds                
              will also be determined.  SeaMarc survey is planned.  This data                
              will be integrated with geophysical data to test rotation models.
