Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  Although most marine organisms have external                              
              fertilization, very little is know about the processes that                    
              control fertilization success and early embryonic survival.                    
              Inter tidal fucoid algae represent an ideal model system in                    
              which to study these processes in nature.  Periods of gamete                   
              release, current velocities during fertilization, and degree                   
              of aggregation of male/female plants will be determined and                    
              /or varied experimentally to determine how they influence                      
              fertilization success, which will be determined cytological.                   
              Whether fertilization can adapt to low salinity environments                   
              is unknown; of particular interest is how the polyspermy                       
              block is affected, because this is Na+-dependent in may                        
              marine species.  Electrophysiological and physiological                        
              techniques will be used to study the polyspermy block in                       
              fucoid algae from low salinity habitats.  The ability of                       
              embryos of intertidal algae to survive the stresses                            
              encountered in the intertidal zone is poorly known. Stage-                     
              specific survival of fucoid embryos during low tidal                           
              emersion will be studied in the laboratory and in nature.                      
              The role of the hormone abscisic acid (ABA) in conferring                      
              tolerance to desiccation and freezing will be examined by                      
              quantitative immunoassay and by treating sensitive stages                      
              with exogenous ABA.  Taken together with existing data, this                   
              work will offer an unusually complete understanding of the                     
              ecological processes affecting recruitment of a marine                         
              organism.
