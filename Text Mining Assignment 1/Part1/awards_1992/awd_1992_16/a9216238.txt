Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The development of the incredibly complex cytoarchitecture of the              
              nervous system is dependent upon the specificity of neuron:neuron              
              and neuron:glial cell intereactions.  One molecule that appears to             
              play a pivotal role in cell:cell interactions is the homophilic                
              adhesion molecule, N-CAM. There are a number of forms of N-CAM,                
              but the N-CAM 180 is the only isoform that is expressed                        
              exclusively in the nervous system.  Immunocytochemical studies                 
              show that this form is localized at developing synapses.  These                
              observations suggest that the sequences encoded by exon 18 of the              
              N-CAM gene may play a unique role in synapse formation.  This                  
              Small Grant for Exploratory Research will allow the PI to examine              
              the role of N-CAM 180 in synapse formation.  The neural specific               
              exon of the N-CAM gene will be deleted in murine embryonic stem                
              cells via homologous recombination.  Transgenic mice homozygous                
              for the deleted gene will be made and studied for overt behavioral             
              abnormalities and defects in synapse formation.  These studies                 
              represent a newly emerging approach to directly study the function             
              of specific molecules in neural development in mammals using gene              
              targeting technology.
