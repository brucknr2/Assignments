Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This three-year award supports U.S.-France cooperative research                
              in materials science between Richard M. Laine of the University                
              of Michigan and Jacques Livage of the Pierre and Marie Curie                   
              University, Paris, France.  The investigators propose to explore               
              the use of novel silicate and alumino silicate as polymer                      
              precursors to oxide and oxynitride glasses and ceramics. The                   
              University of Michigan laboratory will synthesize a series of                  
              related silicon containing precursors, pyrolize them according to              
              a matrix of heating schedules.  The Paris group will characterize              
              the products' chemical composition, ceramic phase and                          
              microstructural makeup through Magic Angel Spinning and solid                  
              state NMR techniques.                                                          
                                                                                             
              The U.S. investigator brings to this collaboration expertise in                
              precursor polymer synthesis.  This is complemented by the French               
              investigator's well-established program in sol-gel and ceramics                
              analysis.  The research will advance understanding of the                      
              fundamental principles for design of precursors to multi-                      
              component (metallic) oxide/oxynitride glasses and ceramics.
