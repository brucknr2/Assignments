Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This three-year award supports U.S.-France cooperative research                
              in physical chemistry between Kenneth C. Janda, University of                  
              California at Irvine, and Nadine Halberstadt, University of Paris,             
              South (Orsay).  The research combines theoretical and                          
              experimental studies to determine the potential energy surface                 
              for electronically excited rare gas halogen complexes known as                 
              van der Waals molecules.  The objectives are (1) to obtain a                   
              detailed interpretation of vibrational predissociation for ArCl2               
              molecule using a newly implemented IVR (intramolecular                         
              vibrational relaxation) theory, and (2) to extend this theory to the           
              structure and dynamics of four-atomic clusters, such as HeCl2.                 
                                                                                             
              The U.S. research group produces very detailed spectra of van                  
              der Waals molecules for which theory is applicable.  This work                 
              has yielded fundamental data about the dynamics of chemical                    
              reactions and the physical transition from gaseous to liquid state.            
              This is complemented by the French investigator's work on                      
              scattering theory as applied to the dissociation dynamics of van               
              der Waals molecules.  The proposed effort will advance                         
              fundamental understanding of cluster dynamics and transitions                  
              from gas to liquid state.
