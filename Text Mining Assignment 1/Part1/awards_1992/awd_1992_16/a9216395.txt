Abstract    :
              This award provides support for campaign coordination activities               
              in one of the principal components of the Geospace Environment                 
              Modeling (GEM) Program.  The GEM program is aimed at making                    
              fundamental advances in our understanding of the geospace (upper-              
              atmosphere, ionosphere, magnetosphere) environment through                     
              coordinated efforts of groups of scientists engaged in                         
              observational, theoretical, and modeling activities.  The goals                
              of the program are established by active scientists based on                   
              results and discussions at workshops.  The principal focus of the              
              campaign coordination workshops to be supported by this project                
              is on observations.
