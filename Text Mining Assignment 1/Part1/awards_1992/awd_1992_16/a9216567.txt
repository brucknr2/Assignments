Abstract    :
              The principal investigator will study three dimensional                        
              excitable media, both in terms of chemical reactions but                       
              also are related to the electrophysiology of the heart.  The                   
              key ideas of the project are 1)  the normal heart muscle is                    
              an excitable medium; 2) some aspects of the dynamics of                        
              excitable media are generic, notably their vortex                              
              excitations; 3) these aspects are inherently 3-dimensional;                    
              4) in heart muscle these vortex excitations are responsible                    
              for the most pernicious arrhythmias, but are almost                            
              impossible to study 3-dimensionally in living heart muscle;                    
              5) they can be studied computationally and in chemically                       
              excitable media, both of which support action-potential-like                   
              propagation in three dimensions; 6) the utility of this                        
              comparison has been validated in two dimensional studies; 7)                   
              the pure computation for equations of mechanism should be                      
              complemented by experiments; 8) such experiments can be                        
              implemented by adapting existing computational procedures in                   
              optical tomography to existing computational procedures for                    
              analysis and display of the data that are currently obtained                   
              by supercomputer solution of the mechanistic equations of                      
              cardiac electrophysiology and of the analogous chemical                        
              kinetics.  The investigator will solve the "three-                             
              dimensional" for the mechanisms and use computer-assisted                      
              optical tomography to observe three dimensional activation                     
              wavefronts in the chemical medium during the analog to these                   
              arrhythmias.  The current project is being supported by four                   
              programs at the National Science Foundation:  Theoretical
