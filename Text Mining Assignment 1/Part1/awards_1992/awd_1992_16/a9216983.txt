Abstract    :
              This project seeks to fully analyze and interpret sediment physical            
              property measurements, through integration of sediment                         
              microstructure observations, new experimental in situ and                      
              laboratory velocity data, and model representations based on rock              
              physics theory.  This work is essential to understanding how                   
              laboratory measurements of sediment physical properties are related            
              to in situ logging measurements.  The PI's previous work indicates             
              that substantial discrepancies may exist between these two types of            
              measurements, and that existing models of sediment compaction and              
              porosity reduction may be inadequate to explain these observed                 
              differences.  This research should allow better interpretation of              
              laboratory and in situ data, and should provide new insights to                
              diagenetic processes, cyclic sedimentation, and seismic reflection             
              data.  In addition, the project will potentially have significant              
              impact on ODP (Ocean Drilling Program) shipboard physical property             
              data collection procedures.
