Abstract    :
              This U.S.-Brazil Cooperative Science award will                                
              support the collaboration of Yaacov Shapira of                                 
              Tufts University and N.F. Oliveira, Jr. and V.                                 
              Bindilatti of the University of Sao Paulo                                      
              (USP), Brazil.  The project aims to focus on                                   
              magnetic interactions in dilute magnetic                                       
              semiconductors.                                                                
                                                                                             
              These materials are ideal for exploring the                                    
              fundamental properties of these interactions.                                  
              The researchers' joint experiments will take                                   
              advantage of the very low temperatures which                                   
              are being produced at USP using a new class of                                 
              plastic dilution refrigerators.  The                                           
              experiments at very high magnetic fields will                                  
              be conducted in U.S. high-magnetic-field                                       
              facilities with which the Tufts group is                                       
              affiliated.  The goal of these experiments will                                
              be to answer various basic questions, including                                
              how the magnetic interactions fall off with                                    
              distance.  The U.S. side will benefit from                                     
              access to USP's new plastic dilution                                           
              refrigerators and superconducting magnets.  The                                
              Brazilian side will acquire expertise in the                                   
              use of magnetization steps to determine                                        
              exchange constants, as well as sources for the                                 
              single crystals to be used in these                                            
              experiments.
