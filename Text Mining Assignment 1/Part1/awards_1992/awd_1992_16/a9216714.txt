Abstract    :
                   This research will focus on developing a methodology and a                
              software tool for the design and verification of heterogeneous                 
              controllers composed of multiple simple controllers.  The component            
              controllers may operate either on different operations regions or              
              on different time scales.  The design tool will use qualitative and            
              semiquantitative simulations of the plants and controllers as                  
              produced by the QSIM and NSIM simulators to map out possible                   
              behaviors, thus producing automatic stability proofs.  (Qualitative            
              models specify monotonic relationships between variables, while                
              semiquantitative models specify envelopes which bound the function             
              relating the variables.)  Models of faults and disturbances will be            
              used to test the robustness of proposed controllers, and either                
              prove their stability or suggest modifications to the control law.
