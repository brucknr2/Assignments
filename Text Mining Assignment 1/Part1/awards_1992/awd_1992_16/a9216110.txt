Abstract    :
                   The work planned in this mathematical sciences group                      
              research project seeks to combine two approaches to the problem                
              of representing signals as expansions of discrete sets of                      
              functions.  One is through the Gabor transform, the other uses                 
              the wavelet expansion.  One of the primary goals of this research              
              is to combine the two approaches using a new technique called the              
              multiplicative Zak transform.  Applications of this work  will                 
              concentrate on characterizations of non-stationary signal.                     
              Algorithms will be developed to compute the coefficients of the                
              resulting double series expansion and signal properties will be                
              derived from the expansions.                                                   
                   Since the multiplicative Zak transformation can be                        
              interpreted as the  Weil map.  It appears in another context                   
              within the representation theory of the Heisenberg group.  This                
              theory provides insight into special function theory including                 
              theta functions and Krautchouk and Poisson-Charlier polynomials.               
              Applications to number theory are also planned.
