Abstract    :
              Advances in molecular cloning technologies have made it                        
              possible to generate                                                           
              large quantities of diverse proteins in micro-organisms, in                    
              order to study the biological and physical properties of                       
              these proteins. The Department of Biochemistry at the                          
              University of Virginia has a long history of biophysical                       
              studies on diverse biological systems and several of the                       
              faculty, particularly the faculty recently recruited, have                     
              research projects designed around studies of such                              
              recombinant proteins. Of the 13 full time faculty, 8 are                       
              either using recombinant proteins or plan to use them in the                   
              near future.                                                                   
                                                                                             
              One problem with this approach to the generation of research                   
              material is in                                                                 
              assembling the hardware necessary for the isolation of these                   
              proteins from bacterial, or other types of, cells. We have                     
              not had a long history of bacteriology or large scale                          
              protein purification and so our resources which were once                      
              adequate for our biochemical needs are now completely                          
              inadequate for generation of recombinant proteins. This                        
              shortfall is compounded by the fact that for many of the                       
              projected biophysical studies particularly large amounts of                    
              protein are required.                                                          
                                                                                             
              We propose to purchase the basic instrumentation for                           
              moderate scale isolation of recombinant proteins from E.                       
              coli, yeast, and other cells.
