Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Detailed vertical velocity shear measurements will be conducted in             
              the fall of 1992 and spring of 1993 in support of the North                    
              Atlantic Tracer Release Experiment (NATRE) using an autonomous                 
              profiler called Cartesian Diver. The observations are to be                    
              conducted at four different locations in concert with                          
              microstructure profiling. The scientific objectives of this study              
              are to relate turbulent mixing processes in the thermocline to the             
              background internal wave field and to relate direct diffusivity                
              measurements obtained from tracer diffusion to eddy diffusivity                
              models based on turbulent dissipation rates.
