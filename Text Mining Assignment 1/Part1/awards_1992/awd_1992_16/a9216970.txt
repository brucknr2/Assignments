Abstract    :
                9216970  Samet    Spatial Query Processing:  A Sorting Approach    This is the
              first year funding of a three-year continuing award.   An investigation is
              being conducted into the efficient processing  of spatial data as arising in
              problems involving scientific data.   Instead of using standard database
              methods which represent spatial  data as points in a higher dimensional space,
              and then storing the  coordinate values in a relation (equivalent to mapping
              the data  into points in a higher dimensional space), the data is organized  by
              sorting it in such a way that the space it occupies is taken  into account. 
              Particular attention is focused on the spatial  variant of the range query. 
              Algorithms for such queries are being  developed in the context of spatial data
              corresponding to road  networks and topography both above ground and underwater
               (represented both as contour lines and surfaces).  Their  performance is being
              evaluated by examining factors such as buffer  utilization, page sizes, page
              faults, data distribution, etc. in  environments where the data is spatially
              sorted and where it is  not.  The evaluation is in terms of real data obtained
              by  cooperating with the US Bureau of the Census and the US Geological  Survey.
               This information is being used to pinpoint where the  algorithms can be
              improved.  Appropriate models for generating the  queries rather than the
              underlying database (which consists of real  data) are also being investigated.
