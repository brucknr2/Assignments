Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This three-year award supports U.S.-France cooperative research                
              in materials science between Randolph S. Duran of the University               
              of Florida and J. Le Moigne of the Institute of Physics and                    
              Chemistry of Materials in Strasbourg, France.  The objective of                
              the research is to develop thin films of new, conjugated polyenic              
              polymers with enhanced non-linear optical (NLO) properties. While              
              materials with NLO properties have been known since the sixties                
              and applied in integrated optics and photonics, there is a need                
              to study the structure-property correlation of these materials in              
              order to optimize their design.                                                
                                                                                             
              The French group will synthesize a series of polymers having high              
              planar content, thus allowing for high NLO properties.                         
              Subsequently, the Florida group will prepare thin films with                   
              controlled molecular conformation and ordering from the                        
              synthesized polymers.  The structure of the resulting thin films               
              will be characterized by both groups.  The proposal takes                      
              advantage of the expertise of an outstanding French polymer                    
              research group in synthesis and characterization techniques.  The              
              collaboration will advance the basic understanding of the NLO                  
              properties of polymers and their potential for optoelectric and                
              photonic applications.
