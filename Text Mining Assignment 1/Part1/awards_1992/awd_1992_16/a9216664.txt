Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This award supports international collaboration between Dr. Bruce              
              Averill, Dr. Patricia Eldredge of the University of Virginia, and              
              Professor Xu Jiqing of Jilin University on iron and molybdeum                  
              compounds related to the FeMo cofactor of nitrogenase.  Under                  
              this award, the principal investigators from China and the US                  
              will work together on developing synthetic analogs of FeMo-co,                 
              the structure of which remains enigmatic.  This collaboration                  
              will allow Professor Xu to combine his theoretical and                         
              mechanistic approach with Professor Averill's expertise in                     
              synthesis and characterization.                                                
                                                                                             
              The U.S.-China Program supports collaborative research of mutual               
              benefit to the US and China.
