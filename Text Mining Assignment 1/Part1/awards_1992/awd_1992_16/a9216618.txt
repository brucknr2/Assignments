Abstract    :
              By means of this award, the Inorganic, Bioninorganic, and                      
              Organometallic Chemistry Program and the Atmospheric Chemistry                 
              Program provide support for an interdisciplinary project on                    
              sources of atmospheric nitrous oxide.  The work will be carried                
              out by Dr. William C. Trogler and Dr. Mark H. Thiemens of the                  
              Chemistry Department of the University of California at San                    
              Diego.  They will examine the mechanism of decomposition of                    
              ammonium nitrate, the reaction of hydroxylamine and nitric                     
              oxide, and other reactions by which nitrous oxide might be                     
              produced.  The influence of aerosols and particulates on these                 
              processes will also be investigated.  The means of elucidating                 
              the reaction mechanism, as well as linking the nitrous oxide                   
              produced by various reactions to nitrous oxide in the                          
              atmosphere, will be isotopic labeling of nitrogen and oxygen.

              The concentration of atmospheric nitrous oxide has been                        
              increasing in recent years, but the sources of this increase                   
              are not well understood.  Trogler and Thiemens will investigate                
              the details of nitrous oxide production from various reactions                 
              that model potential environmental sources.  Trogler's                         
              expertise in reaction mechanisms, catalysis, and                               
              photochemistry, and Thiemens' in gas phase kinetics and mass                   
              spectrometry will be helpful in this collaborative effort to                   
              examine these reactions under relevant conditions.  Nitrous                    
              oxide is a greenhouse gas and is also involved in the                          
              atmospheric ozone balance.
