Abstract    :
                    A two-day workshop is planned to be convened in Minneapolis              
              during Spring, 1993,  which will bring together leading academic               
              scholars in organizational and work-industry research to discuss               
              issues involved in conducting employer-employee surveys.  The four             
              principal investigators of the 1991 National Organizations Study               
              (NOS),  which interviewed informants in the establishments                     
              employing the respondents and spouses sampled by the 1991 General              
              Social Survey,  will relate their experiences and assess                       
              alternative research designs for employer-employee surveys.  Other             
              participants will make individual presentations about the                      
              importance of the data sets for the user community,  the merits of             
              alternative sampling designs,  and the value of various scales and             
              measures of organizational properties.                                         
                                                                                             
                     The results of the workshop will clarify unresolved issues              
              in conducting and analyzing employer-employee surveys.  By securing            
              advice from a broad range of researchers,  this continuing data                
              base endeavor will attain maximum utility for potential users.
