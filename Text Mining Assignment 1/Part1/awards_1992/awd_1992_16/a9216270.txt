Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                                                                                            
              Heterotrophic protista have been shown to be important                         
              components in aquatic food webs.  The goal of this research                    
              program is to develop a new methodology for studying                           
              protistan ecology in aquatic environments.  Present                            
              methodologies for examining these assemblages cannot resolve                   
              the trophic status of some important species, nor do they                      
              facilitate studies of their spatial and temporal                               
              variability.  The identification of many of these species in                   
              natural samples is presently dependent on procedures that                      
              are too laborious (e.g. electron microscopy) or unrealistic                    
              (e.g.  the observation of live specimens)  for routine use.                    
              This  project  will develop a new methodology, based on the                    
              sequencing of ribosomal RNA genes, to construct                                
              fluorescently-labeled oligonucleotide probes for the                           
              identification of protists in mixed assemblages. Moreover,                     
              it will establish a framework by which other investigators                     
              may adapt the methods for the development of probes in their                   
              own work.
