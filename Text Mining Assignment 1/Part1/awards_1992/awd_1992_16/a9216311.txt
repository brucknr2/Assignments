Abstract    :
              Partial travel support is provided to allow a group of eleven US               
              researchers in the area of tribology to travel to the CIS.  They               
              will attend the Joint Soviet-American Conference on New Materials              
              and Technologies in Tribology, to be held in Mensk in Belarus,                 
              and will visit a number of research institutes in Russia,                      
              Belarus, and Ukraine.  The purpose is to assess the state of                   
              tribological research and technology in the former Soviet Union                
              and to open channels of communication and cooperation between                  
              tribology researchers in two countries.
