Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This project will study the processes governing the distribution of            
              Be and B in marine sediments.  Once the behavior of these elements             
              is understood, they have the potential to serve as sensitive                   
              tracers of aqueous fluids in magma generation, and will be                     
              especially useful in studying the origin of island arc magmas.                 
              This project will quantify the occurrence of the elements and their            
              isotopes in porewaters and sediments from a wide range of marine               
              sediment lithologies and perform an experiment with labelled                   
              samples at high pressure and temperature, in order to determine how            
              the elements behave in hydrothermal systems.
