Abstract    :
              The goals of the research are to                                               
              determine the signal-processing                                                
              capabilities of the real-time,

              system in the big brown bat,                                                   
              Eptesicus fuscus, and how the bat                                              
              uses sonar images to control                                                   
              interception of airborne targets.                                              
              It will be determined if novel                                                 
              signal-processing or information-                                              
              coding operations are employed                                                 
              during echolocation.  A                                                        
              computational model will be                                                    
              developed and evaluated and improved                                           
              based on behavioral and                                                        
              neurophysiological experiments                                                 
              designed to determine the properties                                           
              of parallel time and frequency                                                 
              transforms that produce spatial                                                
              images of targets.                                                             
              This research is important because                                             
              the model will illustrate how to                                               
              bring time- and frequency- domain                                              
              information together to form images.                                           
              This information could be used to                                              
              advance the design of made-made                                                
              systems for target tracking and                                                
              target identification.
