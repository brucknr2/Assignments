Abstract    :
              This award is made as the starter grant increment of Dr Arthur                 
              Palmer's postdoctoral research fellowship. Dr Palmer will apply                
              NMR and fluorescence spectroscopies to the determination of                    
              structural and dynamic aspects ofmaromolecular chemistry. The                  
              systems to be studied fall into the categories of cases of                     
              ligand binding on the dynamics of ribonucleases, dynamic                       
              aspects of nucleic acid recognition by proteins, and structural                
              aspects of membrane receptor proteins.                                         
                                                                                             
              %%%                                                                            
                                                                                             
              This research will advance the knowledge of how large molecules                
              of biological interest move and how they interact with smaller                 
              molecules. Advances in this area can lead to a much better                     
              understanding of metabolism and metabolic disorders.
