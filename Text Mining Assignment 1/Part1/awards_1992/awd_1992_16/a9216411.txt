Abstract    :
              In this project, the principal investigator will support WOCE                  
              cruise P-17N in the Northeast Pacific Ocean, by collecting and                 
              analyzing direct velocity measurements of upper ocean currents                 
              using a shipboard Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler (ADCP) and                 
              navigation data from the Global Positioning System (GPS)                       
              satellite system.  Combined with the many other data sets on P-                
              17N, these data will be used to address zonal redistribution of                
              heat in the North Pacific, and heat, freshwater, and nutrient                  
              fluxes in the eastern boundary.
