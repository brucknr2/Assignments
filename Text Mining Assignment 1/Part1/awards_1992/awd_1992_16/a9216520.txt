Abstract    :
              This project plans to use Genetic Algorithms for                               
              the detection of structural system disturbances in a                           
              dispersed manner and to coordinate their use with                              
              adaptive controllers capable of dealing with these                             
              structural uncertainties.  These ideas are to be                               
              merged with interval mathematical methods for                                  
              dealing with the system uncertainties in a formal                              
              and rapid manner without the excessive                                         
              conservatism sometimes associated with these                                   
              methods.  When these ideas are applied to power                                
              systems, the objective of the proposed work go well                            
              beyond the scope of present system relaying                                    
              practices in that permissible actions include not                              
              only line disconnection, but adjustment of many                                
              control settings of rapid-acting components in the                             
              system, such as the new FACTS devices being                                    
              introduced into power systems.  The proposed                                   
              methodologies should integrate smoothly with                                   
              centralized control and dispatch policies based on                             
              Optimum Power Flow technology.
