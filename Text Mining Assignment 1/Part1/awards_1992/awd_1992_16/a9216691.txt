Abstract    :
              This research project will investigate the coordination of two                 
              physically-coupled human arms and two artificial arms in                       
              cooperative manipulation tasks.  The project will focus on the                 
              interaction when there is physical contact between the two arms.               
              The mechanisms underlying the generation of trajectories and the               
              interaction forces and moments of two human arms will be studied.              
              The investigators also will develop control algorithms that would              
              specify the motion and forces of two artificial manipulators                   
              during the performance of similar coordinated tasks.                           
                                                                                             
              This research is important since the understanding of coordinated              
              reaching and manipulation by humans will be advanced.  In                      
              addition, the research will improve the control algorithms for                 
              coordinated multi-robotic reaching and grasping.
