Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The principal investigator will extend his 1967 theory of wind                 
              generation of ocean surface waves by including turbulent Reynolds              
              stresses associated with the air flow explicitly in the model.                 
              Several parameterizations of the air turbulene effects will be                 
              tested to provide insight and context to recent observational and              
              modeling investigations of ocean waves.
