Abstract    :
                   This Institutional Infrastructure award is for the support of             
              research projects in artificial intelligence and parallel                      
              computing.  The infrastructure consists of a parallel computer and             
              the staff to maintain the computer.  The projects supported by this            
              award include learning algorithms, real time decision making, data-            
              parallel compilers, and parallel programming support environments.             
                                                                                             
                   Parallel computers are research tools in two senses. The                  
              first is that they provide a substantial increase in computational             
              power.  The second is that they act as an experimental vehicle for             
              new systems software that needs to be developed in order to use the            
              computers effectively.  This award addresses both questions.  The              
              artificial intelligence research needs the computing power while               
              the compiler and support environment work needs the experimental               
              vehicle.
