Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              A high resolution study of linear and non-linear interactions                  
              within Equatorial Pacific carbonate system over the past 4 m.y.,               
              using GRAPE as a CaCO3 proxy. Record of this proxy from ODP Leg 138            
              and its detailed oxygen-isotopic data will be used to learn more               
              about the dynamics of the carbonate system. A two year funding is              
              provided.
