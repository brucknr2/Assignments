Abstract    :
              This research project will examine                                             
              and model the way in which normal                                              
              human subjects visually track                                                  
              continuously moving targets.  The                                              
              way in which the smooth pursuit and                                            
              saccadic eye movement systems                                                  
              interact with each other to maintain                                           
              fixation on the target and reacquire                                           
              it when imperfect tracking causes                                              
              the image to move off the fovea will                                           
              be studied.  In addition, the way in                                           
              which subjects develop an internal                                             
              representation of repetitive target                                            
              motion, which they then use to                                                 
              predict the target's trajectory,                                               
              will be investigated.                                                          
                                                                                             
              The model developed by this research                                           
              will be useful in explaining the                                               
              control of biological systems and                                              
              also in developing a biologically-                                             
              based active vision system.
