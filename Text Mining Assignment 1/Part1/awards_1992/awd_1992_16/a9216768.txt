Abstract    :
              This proposal presents a two-year research                                     
              project to investigate the functionality of                                    
              devices based on single electron charging and                                  
              quantum waveguide phenomena.  This is a                                        
              collaborative program of work between the                                      
              University of Oregon and ETDL, Fort                                            
              Monmouth.                                                                      
                                                                                             
              The objective of the proposed research is to                                   
              achieve specific devices characteristics by                                    
              designing an array of gate electrodes to                                       
              control simultaneously the charge storage and                                  
              transport properties of the two-dimensional                                    
              electron gas in a semiconductor                                                
              heterostructure.  The dimensions and spacings                                  
              of the electrodes will be sufficiently small that                              
              the width of the undepleted regions in the                                     
              electrons gas will be comparable to the Fermi                                  
              wavelength.  In this manner we will realize                                    
              interconnected quantum waveguides and                                          
              cavities.  Following the results of the previous                               
              collaborative award, we have identified two                                    
              particular devices to study; a lateral resonant                                
              tunneling diode that will act a coupler (switch)                               
              between two waveguides, and a dynamic                                          
              memory element.  We will fabricate these                                       
              devices using electron-beam lithography, and                                   
              characterize their transport properties from                                   
              DC to above 1GHz over the temperature                                          
              range 77 - 0.05 Kelvin.
