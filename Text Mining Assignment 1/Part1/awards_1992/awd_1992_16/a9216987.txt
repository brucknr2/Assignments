Abstract    :
                   This award supports a conference entitled:  "Representation               
              Theory and Analysis on Homogeneous Spaces".  The conference will               
              be held February 5-7, 1993, on the campus of Rutgers University,               
              New Brunswick, New Jersey.  The conference will be concerned with              
              harmonic analysis on nilpotent and solvable Lie groups,                        
              representation theory of real reductive Lie groups,                            
              representations of p-adic groups, infinite-dimensional Lie                     
              algebras and groups, discrete groups, and spectral theory of                   
              invariant differential operators on homogeneous spaces with                    
              applications to local solvability and regularity of more general               
              differential operators.  The purpose of the conference is to                   
              create an environment for cross-fertilization among the                        
              above-named subfields of "non-abelian harmonic analysis" and to                
              emphasize the connections between them.
