Abstract    :
              9216912   Lemasters    This  is  a  proposal  for  an UV/visible  laser 
              s,canning  confocal  microscope  system.  The  microscope system consists  of 
              a  UV/visible  scanning  imaging head with dual detectors, a scan control and 
              imaging  acquisition  system,  a  Z-focus controller,  argon  and 
              argonlkrypton  lasers  for illumination at 351-363, 440, 488, 568 and 647 nm, 
              and  an  inverted  fluorescence  microscope. The  microscope  will  be  used 
              to  examine single living cells, fixed tissue and isolated perfused  organs 
              that  have  been  labeled with multiple fluorescent probes.  In  living  cells 
               and   tissues,   confocal  images  of  the   parameter-specific  fluorescence 
              of each probe will be collected and stored during  experi  mental
              manipulations. UV capabilities are specifically sought in  order  to  use UV
              fluorophores for imaging of ions, chromatin, and protein and  non-protein 
              thiols,  and  for use with caged compounds.  The  confocal  microscope is also
              sought to relieve the critically high demand  for  a  visible light (non-UV)
              confocal microscope already in place, whose high  utilization curtails confocal
              instrument availability to all users. The  equipment  will  be  utilized  by 
              many  investigators  on  independent  projects in 8 departments of the
              University of North Carolina at Chapel  Hill.  Housed  in  the productive
              environment of the  Video  Microscopy  Facility  of  the  Laboratories for Cell
              Biology, the UV/visible  laser  scanning  confocal  microscope  system will 
              substantially  extend  our  ongoing  efforts applying digitized optical
              microscopy to  problems  of  biology.
