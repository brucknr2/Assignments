Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  This project will model several aspects of magmatic and                   
              hydrothermal activities at the mid-oceanic ridges by application of            
              percolation theory. An important question the P.I.s will address is            
              the longevity of hydrothermal vents. They will also their model for            
              phreatic eruptions on land to megaplume formation at the ridges.
