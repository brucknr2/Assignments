Abstract    :
              This project is in the general area of analytical and surface                  
              chemistry and in the subfield of electrochemistry.  During the                 
              tenure of this three-year continuing grant, Professor Creager and              
              his students will study electron transfer over long distances in               
              organized monolayers.  This research will focus specifically on                
              the role that the local medium, particularly the bridging                      
              structure between reactants, plays in dictating the rate and                   
              pathway for electron transfer.  Using novel ferrocene-capped rigid             
              polyphenylene oligomers attached to gold microelectrodes via thiol             
              termini, the temperature dependence of electron transfer rates on              
              ion pairing and other local medium effects will be investigated.               
              The structure of these rigid monolayers will be characterized by               
              surface x-ray scattering experiments that will be carried out at               
              Brookhaven National Laboratory.

              This research is expected to enhance the current understanding of              
              long range electron transfer processes that are of central                     
              importance to many biological functions such as photosynthesis and             
              cellular energy transduction involving redox proteins.
