Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                                                                                            
              Dissolved organic carbon (DOC) is the largest organic carbon pool              
              in the ocean, and is an important component in the global carbon               
              cycle.  New DOC measurements will be made in the Pacific using a               
              reference method (sealed tube combustions) for two purposes:  to               
              check new HTCO (high temperature catalytic oxidation) measurements             
              now being made in the Pacific, and to determine the source and age             
              of DOC in surface waters of the equatorial upwelling region at                 
              140oW. The proposed measurements would supplement and validate a new           
              program of DOC measurements being made by Dr. Edward Peltzer (WHOI)            
              as part of the JGOFS EqPac program.  The research is also designed             
              as a pilot study for using natural abundance &13C and 14C isotopic             
              measurements to study the cycle of DOC in the oceans.
