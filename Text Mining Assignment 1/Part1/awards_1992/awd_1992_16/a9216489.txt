Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This project involves the dissertation research of a cultural                  
              anthropologist from Stanford University studying how costume is                
              used by people in the Ecuadorian Andes to express ethnic                       
              identity.  Using participant observation and the analysis of                   
              media in four areas of Ecuador varying in the degree of                        
              indigenous dress as well as wealth and commercialization, the                  
              project will analyze changes in indigenous costume and how native              
              dress is used as a political symbol.                                           
                                                                                             
              This research is important because it will increase our                        
              understanding of how people manipulate symbols of ethnic identity              
              to achieve goals with respect to local and regional governments.               
              Local costume is used as an ethnic marker in many parts of the                 
              world, and rather than disappearing as people "modernize", is                  
              increasing in selective ways.  This project will advance our                   
              understanding of how material culture is manipulated by people                 
              for political and social goals. By showing how outsiders'                      
              representations of ethnic groups perpetuate ethnic stereotypes                 
              and exacerbate racial tensions, the research can provide valuable              
              information on how to alleviate these tensions.
