Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              In this project, the P.I.s will analyze major and trace element                
              chemistry of primitive compositions (>Fo90 olivine,>An90                       
              plagioclase). Lavas of such compositions are rare in MORBs but have            
              been found in off-axis areas. The P.I.s argue that these melts                 
              could be important primary MORBs. They will rehomogenize the                   
              inclusions to explore the effects of post-entrapment changes.                  
              Finally, they will run 1-atm experiment on these melts. Their                  
              ultimate objective is to determine the conditions under which such             
              melts may be generated at MORBs.
