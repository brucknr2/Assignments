Abstract    :
              The research proposes to investigate the behavior of marine clays              
              under large strains with wave and tsunami loadings.  The wave                  
              induced forces have been continuously transporting soft sediments              
              from shallow water depths to deeper part of the ocean.  It is                  
              proposed to examine the stability of the marine clays by                       
              subjecting them to similar stress paths and damage caused by the               
              waves.  A special testing device will be used to subject the                   
              clays to circular stress paths which can not be applied in                     
              conventional available apparatuses.  Additional tests are                      
              proposed to relate Plasticity index, overconsolidation ratio and               
              anisotropy of clay to coefficient of permeability.  Finally an                 
              effort will be made to develop or modify and incremental                       
              constitutive model which can simulate the effect of rotation of                
              principal stress direction.  The International Workshop held at                
              Case Western University on July 22-24, 1987 clearly indicated                  
              that none of the existing constitutive laws can predict that                   
              behavior under such a stress path.
