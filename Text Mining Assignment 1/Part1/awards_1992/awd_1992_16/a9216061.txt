Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Animals utilize a variety of strategies to survive when exposed to             
              prolonged periods of cold exposure. Some of these strategies                   
              involve maintaining body temperature at "normal" levels; others                
              involve allowing body temperature to fall. The mechanisms                      
              associated with regulating the responses exposed animals as well as            
              those underlying the ability of the cells and tissues of these                 
              animals to retain functional integrity are of intrinsic as well as             
              practical interest. This symposium will bring together scientists              
              from around the world to discuss the latest information regarding              
              these mechanisms.
