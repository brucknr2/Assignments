Abstract    :
              9216626  MULLER-KARGER      This is a study of the relation of near surface
              biogeochemical  processes to the downward flux of particulate materials along a
               continental margin where down-slope lateral losses into the ocean's  interior
              are minimal. Specifically, low-cost ocean margin time  series station in the
              Cariaco Basin, a depression located on the  continental margin of the southern
              Caribbean Sea, will be  inflemeated.  Monthly hydrographic casts and bi-weekly
              sediment  flux at 4 depths using automated moore traps will the conducted  high
              resolution satellite data will be collected using an antenna  located in
              Caracas, Benezuela. This program is identified is as  CARIACO (CArbon Retention
              In A Colored Ocean).  The goals of the  CARIACO program are to:  a) quantify
              oceanographic processes that  affect the vertical flux of nutrients, carbon
              uptake, and carbon  deposition, including the interaction between wind speed,
              sea level  (as an indicator of geostrophic current strength), river discharge, 
              sea surface temperature, and irradiance above an anoxic basin; to  define
              variability in biogeochemcial fluxes in an area affected by  seasonal upwelling
              and river discharge; c) quantify the relative  importance of primary production
              versus terrigenous inputs of  particulate and dissolved materials in the
              downward flux and  sediments storage; d) determine the seasonal taxonomic
              composition  of plankton in the water column, with emphasis on vertical 
              variations of phytoplankton and foraminifera species; e) develop a 
              two-dimensional numerical model the allows examination of the  annual cycle of
              population responses, vertical biogenic fluxes, and  degradation of detritus at
              depth; and f) examine the relationship  between water-column oceanographic
              processes and sediment fluxes in  order to understand the origin of sediment
              varves and their  relationship to past climate change.
