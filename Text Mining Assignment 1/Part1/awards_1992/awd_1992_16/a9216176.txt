Abstract    :
              Boundary integral method and parallel processing techniques                    
              are used to simulate the motion and break-up of deformable                     
              particles (including drops and bubbles) encountered in a                       
              variety of biological and industrial situations.  Particles                    
              are of a newtonian fluid, and are bounded by interfaces with                   
              generalized mechanical properties.  Analysis is performed in                   
              two- and three-dimensions, for individual particles, a                         
              periodic lattice of particles, and a random dispersion.  The                   
              main objectives of the research are to delineate the                           
              significance of interfacial properties on the motion and                       
              deformation of particles, compute the magnitude of interfacial                 
              tensions developing during deformations, establish criteria                    
              for permanent deformations and break-up, and study the                         
              rheological properties of dilute and concentrated suspensions.                 
              The research is conducted through numerical computations which                 
              are based on asymptotic methods and advanced implementations                   
              of boundary integral methods.  A substantial part of the                       
              numerical effort is devoted towards developing efficient                       
              techniques of coupling the flow inside and outside a particle                  
              and the deformation of the interfaces.                                         
                                                                                             
              The proposed field of research is relevant to bioengineering                   
              and chemical manufacturing processing, as well as to high                      
              performance computing.//
