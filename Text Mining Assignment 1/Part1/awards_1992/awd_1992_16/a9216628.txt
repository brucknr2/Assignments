Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This project will conduct laboratory experiments on the dynamics of            
              hydrothermal plumes.  The focus will be on the meso-scale flow,                
              where rotation and geostrophic adjustment are important.  The first            
              experiment will examine the effects of rotation on the rise height             
              of plumes.  The second will study the effects of ambient flows on              
              plume vortex generation.  The third will examine the effects of                
              rotation on the dynamics in instantaneous releases of finite                   
              volumes of buoyant fluid to simulate megaplume formation.  The                 
              overall goal is to improve knowledge of the dynamics of                        
              hydrothermal venting and to help in the interpretation and                     
              understanding of observations of the local vent field ecology,                 
              chemical and heat fluxes, as well as deep ocean circulation.
