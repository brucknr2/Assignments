Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  The Estuarine Research Federation, the nation's leading                   
              scientific society for estuarine scientists, managers and                      
              educators, and the Estuarine and Coastal Sciences Association                  
              (ECSA), the leading European estuarine society, will hold a joint              
              international estuarine meeting on Sept, 13-18, 1992, in Plymouth,             
              England.  This meeting is significant in that it brings together               
              for the first time the two major estuarine societies in the world              
              to discuss the most significant problems facing estuaries and                  
              coastal areas from both the science and management viewpoint. The              
              theme of the conference is "changes in fluxes to estuaries:                    
              Implications from science to management."  This award will help to             
              augment participation by US scientists.  This award is made to the             
              Sea Grant Program and will be combined with funds from that agency             
              to support the meeting.
