Abstract    :
              Using modern panoramic detectors and modern computers a massive                
              photometric search for variable objects in the Galactic Bulge is               
              being undertaken.  About 100,000,000 photometric measurements are              
              obtained each year.  The primary goal is to detect gravitational               
              microlensing of the Bulge stars by stars, brown dwarfs and planets             
              in the intervening galactic disk.  A large catalogue of variable               
              stars of all kinds will be generated and made available to any                 
              interested investigator.
