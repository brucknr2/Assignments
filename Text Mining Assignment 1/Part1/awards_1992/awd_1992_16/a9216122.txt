Abstract    :
               Structural recursion provides a unifying paradigm for  the forms  of
              manipulation of collection types that are common in  programming  languages and
              databases.  As evidence for this claim a general characterization   is
              developed for the semantics of  programs that exploit structural  recursion on
              lists, bags, and sets.  An intimate connection is  identified between 
              structural recursion and a range of existing languages that  manipulate complex
              objects.  This project conducts an investigation into  the general  principles
              of collection types, including heterogeneous  collections, the semantics of
              collections in the presence of  divergence, the  parallel semantics of
              collection languages, the equational  theories of collection languages  as a
              basis for discovering and validating  optimizations, and extended
              pattern-matching with collection types.  It also  involves the design and
              prototype implementation of a language  demonstrating  most of these ideas.
