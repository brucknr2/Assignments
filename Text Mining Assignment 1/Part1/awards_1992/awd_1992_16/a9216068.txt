Abstract    :
              Coordinated Global Wind Measurements with the UNH Meteor Radar                 
              System                                                                         
              This proposal requests funds to operate the UNH Meteor Radar as                
              part of the Mesosphere Lower Thermosphere Radar Network and to                 
              continue global measurements under the Lower Thermosphere Coupling             
              Study (LTCS) of CEDAR/MLTCS of STEP.  The radar will also be used              
              to make joint observations with the Incoherent Scatter Radar at                
              Millstone Hill.  Continuing studies of mean winds, tides, gravity              
              waves, and longer period winds will accompany the radar                        
              measurements.
