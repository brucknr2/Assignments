Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Project Description (Technical):                                               
                                                                                             
              This research investigates the dynamical properties of disordered              
              systems and quantum solids at low temperatures.  The aim is to                 
              determine the nature of the low-energy excitations in disordered               
              solids, the behavior of quantum confined structures and quantum                
              rotors in reduced geometries, and to develop new ultra-low                     
              temperature thermometers.                                                      
                                                                                             
              Project Description (Non-Technical):                                           
                                                                                             
              This project studies the properties of materials at ultralow                   
              temperatures, where it is even difficult to measure the temperature            
              in a convenient manner.  The research will study the motion of                 
              nuclei of matter by detecting the precession of the nucleus in a               
              magnetic field.  In addition, related measurements in pure metals              
              will be used in attempts to develop a new thermometer for these                
              ultralow temperature measurements.
