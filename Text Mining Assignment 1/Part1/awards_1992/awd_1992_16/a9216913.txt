Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This project will involve detailed geochemical and isotopic (He,               
              Pb, Sr, Nd, and O) study of Holocene-to-recent hot spot generated              
              lavas on Canary and Galapagos islands.  The principal  goal is to              
              obtain constraints on scale of heterogeneity associated with hot               
              spot volcanism and to decipher the origin of seamounts and oceanic             
              plateaus.  The P.I. will also explore the potential of ?U+Th!/He               
              dating of young lavas.
