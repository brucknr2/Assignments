Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  The  Juan Fernandez microplate was surveyed in 1991, obtaining            
              GLORIA sidescan, Hydrosweep bathymetric, magnetic, gravity, and 3.5            
              kHz data.  The principal investigator will conduct an extended                 
              analysis of these data and will map in detail the structures of the            
              Juan Fernandez microplate, determining the best-fitting model or               
              models for its tectonic evolution, and will study the forces that              
              derive microplate evolution.  Questions to be addressed include:               
              (1) What is the present-day detailed structural and tectonic nature            
              of the Juan Fernandez microplate and its boundaries? (2) What is               
              the origin and detailed evolution of this microplate? (3) How is               
              the lithosphere deformed along the Juan Fernandez-Antarctic plate              
              boundary? (4) How does the Juan Fernandez microplate compare to                
              other microplates and what general model best applies to their                 
              origin and tectonic evolution.
