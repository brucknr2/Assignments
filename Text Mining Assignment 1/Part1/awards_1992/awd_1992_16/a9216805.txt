Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                                                                                             
                                                                                             
                                                                                            
              Data from the North Pacific Gyre will be examined to determine the             
              degree of variability normal to the gyre, and the extent to                    
              which the area around Hawaii is typical of the gyre.  A preliminary            
              analysis of historical data suggests that differences may exist in             
              upper ocean near Hawaii with respect to the characteristic                     
              structure seen on long transects and over many years at the Climax             
              Station, about 750 km north of Hawaii.  It is not known whether                
              these tentatively-identified differences are due to island mass                
              effects, or if they are part of a large-scale spatial gradient.                
              Hydrographic, nutrient and oxygen data are being gathered and                  
              analyzed in order to determine the extent to which the structure               
              near Hawaii and at station Aloha is typical of the North Pacific               
              central gyre, and whether any differences identified are likely to             
              be important in the context of JGOFS.
