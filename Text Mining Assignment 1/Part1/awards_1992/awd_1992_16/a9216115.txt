Abstract    :
                   This grant covers experimental Elementary Particle                        
              Physics research by a group at Adelphi University in                           
              collaboration with other NSF and DOE supported scientists.                     
              The group will make precision measurements of the parameters                   
              which specify the electroweak interactions within the Standard                 
              Model of interacting quarks and leptons.  They will initiate                   
              research on neutrino interactions at Fermilab and participate                  
              in design studies for the SSC.
