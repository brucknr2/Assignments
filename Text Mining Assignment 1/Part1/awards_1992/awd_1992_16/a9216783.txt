              This Science in Developing Countries Program                                   
              award supports travel expenses of U.S. and                                     
              Latin American physicists and doctoral students                                
              to participate in a Workshop on High Energy                                    
              Physics, held in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, in                                    
              January 1993.  Workshop organizers are Marleigh                                
              Sheaff of the University of Wisconsin and                                      
              Alberto Santoro of the Centro Brasileiro de                                    
              Pesquisas Fisicas (CBPF) in Brazil.                                            
                                                                                             
              The workshop is organized in conjunction with                                  
              collaborative projects associated with                                         
              experiments 769 and 791 conducted by Fermilab                                  
              and Brazilian high energy physicists.  Its aim                                 
              is to involve graduate students and junior                                     
              researchers in these projects and enhance their                                
              background in high energy physics.  This                                       
              workshop is likely to produce benefits to all                                  
              participating countries by promoting science                                   
              education and the development of future                                        
              collaborative research ties.
