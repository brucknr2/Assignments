Abstract    :
              The Applied Ocean Physics & Engineering Department at Woods Hole               
              Oceanographic Institution will continue an instrumentation and                 
              technology development project to design and construct an unmanned,            
              untethered vehicle for performing and servicing long-term deep                 
              ocean benthic experiments.  This vehicle has been named ABE for the            
              Autonomous Benthic Explorer.  Design criteria call for it to be                
              launched from any oceanographic research ship and be able to remain            
              on site for several months.  During this time span it must period-             
              ically move about in its acoustic navigation net, taking pictures              
              and making a variety of scientific measurements.  At the end of its            
              mission, it is to be recovered on command.                                     
                                                                                             
              ABE will complement and extend the capabilities of manned submer-              
              sibles, particularly DSV ALVIN, as well as remotely operated,                  
              tethered systems.  ABE shall have the ability to remain at a deep              
              sea research site for long periods of time or to return to a                   
              previously surveyed site to observe changes.  This development                 
              project is in anticipation of planned research initiatives                     
              requiring long-term observations of seafloor features such as                  
              hydrothermal vents and mid-ocean ridges.
