Abstract    :
                   In most streams, community production is sustained by the                 
              decomposition of imported plant litter.  The early stages of                   
              plant litter decomposition have received much study; but little                
              work has focused on the fate of fine organic particles (FPOM),                 
              the form in which most particulate detritus moves through stream               
              ecosystems.  Utilizing recently developed biochemical techniques,              
              I propose to investigate the structure and activity of FPOM-                   
              associated microbial communities in two concurrent field                       
              experiments.  The first is intended to evaluate a series of basic              
              hypotheses about microbial production, extracellular enzyme                    
              activity and community structure over a broad range of                         
              conditions.  The second is focused specifically on the                         
              relationship between FPOM degradation rates and the activity of                
              lignocellulose-degrading enzymes.

                   This work will contribute to our basic understanding of the               
              operation of attached microbial communities, a topic of broad                  
              interest.  In addition, it may lead to the formulation of models               
              that relate FPOM mass loss, currently difficult to determine in                
              situ, to the activity of lignocellulose-degrading enzymes, a                   
              readily quantified measure.  Such a model would permit routine                 
              monitoring of FPOM degradation rates, an application that could                
              contribute to future studies of ecosystem processes and                        
              management.
