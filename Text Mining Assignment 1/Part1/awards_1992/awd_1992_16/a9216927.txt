Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This U.S.-Mexico award will support Professor                                  
              Keith Pannell of the University of Texas at El                                 
              Paso in a research collaboration with Professor                                
              Jorge Cervantes of the Universidad de Guanajuato,                              
              Mexico.  The objective of the collaboration is to                              
              synthesize new transition metal complexes                                      
              containing Si-Sn and Ge-Sn bonds directly bonded                               
              to the metal atom, and study their                                             
              photochemistry, reactivity toward base,                                        
              structures and mass spectrometric properties.                                  
              The researchers also propose to synthesize a                                   
              series of metal substituted oligosilyl-siloxanes                               
              for study of redox and conductivity properties,                                
              and incorporation into polymeric siloxane                                      
              materials.                                                                     
                                                                                             
              The synthesis of metal complexes, and                                          
              photochemical, and structural aspects of the                                   
              collaborative work will be performed in El Paso,                               
              while base-induced migrations, oligosilyl-                                     
              siloxane precursor synthesis, and mass spectral                                
              simulations will be performed in Guanajuato.
