Abstract    :
                   This supplement augments the research program at Northwestern             
              University's Industry/University Cooperative Research Center for               
              Engineering Tribology by cost-sharing a joint collaborative "TIE"              
              project with the University of California, Berkeley's                          
              Industry/University Cooperative Research Center for Sensors and                
              Actuators.                                                                     
                   The "TIE" project is a joint synergistic effort to study and              
              model the friction occurring with extremely small devices and                  
              loads.  The Industry/University Cooperative Research Center                    
              (I/UCRC) for Sensors and Actuators is studying friction in very                
              small devices under extremely small loads.  The I/UCRC for                     
              Engineering Tribology is developing relevant solid mechanism models            
              that satisfy its collaboration's observations.  The Division of                
              Mechanical & Structural Systems is cost-sharing this project.                  
                   The Program Manager recommends Northwestern University be                 
              awarded $50,000 for a two-year "TIE" project to be performed                   
              collaboratively with the University of California, Berkeley.
