Abstract    :
              A Study of Mesospheric Radar Scattering                                        
              In this one year program of research, an explanation will be sought            
              for the disagreement between motions inferred from the analysis of             
              incoherent scatter and partial reflection radar data as measured               
              during the Arecibo Initiative on the Dynamics of the Atmosphere,               
              March through May, 1989 (AIDA '89).  The principal data sources to             
              be utilized come from the Arecibo observatory UHF incoherent                   
              scatter radar (ISR) observations, from the Utah State University               
              imaging doppler interferometry (IDI) MF radar and from the Geospace            
              Research meteor wind radar (MWR).  The investigation will                      
              concentrate on the scattering mechanisms involved, which, at least             
              in the case of the IDI, are as yet not fully understood.  The IDI              
              scattering points may originate from turbulent eddies in the mean              
              flow, or they may be specular reflection from individual gravity               
              wave fronts.  To address this problem the investigators will rely              
              heavily on the considerable body of knowledge available on the                 
              propagation of waves in turbulent media, and on an existing archive            
              of "snapshots" of small scale motions at mesospheric - lower                   
              thermospheric altitudes as revealed by high resolution photography             
              of rocket released chemical trails.
