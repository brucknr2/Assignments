Abstract    :
              Abstract for Demetre Economou / University of Houston / CTS-9216023    A
              combined modeling and experimental program is proposed to improve the
              understanding of plasma processes such as plasma etching and plasma deposition
              of thin films, and to aid in the development of new plasma reactors.  The work
              proposed here represents an extension and continuation of previous work.  The
              argon/chlorine plasma system will be investigated.      Two kinds of glow
              discharge models will be considered viz. an overall glow discharge model and a
              simpler two-region model.  Solutions of the time-dependent Boltzmann equation
              will be sought to obtain information on electron transport and reaction
              coefficients; these results will be integrated with results for neutral
              transport and neutral reaction. Model predictions will be compared to
              experiment. Spatially resolved optical emission spectroscopy, laser
              interferometry, and Langmuir probe measurements together with mass
              spectrometric measurements and ion flux and energy analysis will be carried
              out.  The model will be applied to three kinds of reactor configurations viz.
              parallel plate reactors, electrodeless plasmas and the source region of ECR
              reactors.  Silicon and  GaAs will be used as substrates for etching studies.
