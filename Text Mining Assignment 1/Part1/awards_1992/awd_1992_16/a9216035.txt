Abstract    :
              This award supports a program of research in heavy ion nuclear                 
              physics at the Nuclear Structure Laboratory, State University of               
              New York at Stony Brook, using a superconducting booster                       
              accelerator in conjunction with a model FN tandem accelerator.                 
              The research is carried out by SUNY Stony Brook staff and                      
              provides for the training of graduate students in nuclear                      
              science, accelerator physics and instrumentation development.                  
              The objective of much of the research is to find how nuclei                    
              behave under extreme conditions of high spin and/or high                       
              temperature.  Another effort involves the application of laser                 
              spectroscopy and atomic physics methods to determine nuclear                   
              moments and properties of radioactive atoms.  Nucleus-nucleus                  
              reaction mechanisms are probed over a range of incident energies               
              from below the Coulomb barrier, where collective nuclear response              
              is important, to higher energies where individual nucleon-nucleon              
              collisional aspect begin to be evident.  The project also entails              
              new instrumentation and accelerator development, and continuing                
              facility refinement.
