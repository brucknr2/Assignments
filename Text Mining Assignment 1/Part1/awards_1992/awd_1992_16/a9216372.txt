Abstract    :
              This research project develops new artificial neural network                   
              concepts for environment related prediction and spatial control                
              that are inspired by the hippocampal function.  Hippocampus is an              
              enfolding of cerebral cortex into the lateral tissue of a cerebral             
              hemisphere.  The research combines a theory of brain development               
              and a theory of hippocampal function with recent developments in               
              statistical decision theory based upon recurrence and                          
              robustification of artificial neural networks.  The major focus of             
              this project is on a study of hippocampally inspired recurrent                 
              neural structures, adaptively developed connectivity, robust neural            
              operations and mapping, and information-theoretic approaches for               
              accessing and eventually reducing the computational demands on the             
              networks.  The combination of biological and engineering research              
              produces a self re-enforcing, positive feedback, and the robust                
              theory leads to a deeper understanding of the function of                      
              hippocampus, and new concepts for better implementations of spatial            
              control based on robust decision theory.
