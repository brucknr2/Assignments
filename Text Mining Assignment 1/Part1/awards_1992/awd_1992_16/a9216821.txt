Abstract    :
                   This project will study plasma turbulance in the solar corona             
              and solar wind using radio propagation techniques.  The sources of             
              the radio waves are extragalactic radio sources which emit                     
              partially linearly polarized radiation over a wide frequency range.            
              The sources are observed with standard radioastronomical                       
              instruments such as the Very Large Array (VLA) and Very Long                   
              Baseline Array (VLBA).  When these sources are viewed through the              
              turbulent plasma medium of the corona and solar wind, various                  
              distortion or "blurring" effects may be observed.  From                        
              measurements of these effects, information about the intensity,                
              spatial power spectrum, and physical nature of the turbulence can              
              be deduced.  During the proposed grant period information on                   
              coronal turbulence will be obtained from two types of observation.             
              The first is a measurement of angular broadening or "blurring" of              
              a radio source viewed through a turbulent medium.  These                       
              observations will be carried out with the VLA and VLBA.  The second            
              type of observation consists of measurement of Faraday Rotation of             
              the plane of polarization of alinearly polarized radio source.                 
              These observations will be made with the VLA and will provide                  
              information on variations in the magnetic field in the corona as               
              well as density variations.  Finally, theoretical work will be made            
              which relates radioastronomical observables to properties of                   
              coronal plasma waves.
