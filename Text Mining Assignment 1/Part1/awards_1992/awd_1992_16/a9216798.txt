Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This project deals with application of a kinetic model                         
              describing the general sequence of events undergone by protein                 
              at an interface to quantify protein charge and stability                       
              effects on interfacial behavior.  Selected synthetic mutants                   
              of bacteriophage T4 lysozyme are produced form transformed                     
              cells obtained from the Institute of Molecular Biology at the                  
              University of Oregon.  Mutants exhibiting differences in                       
              thermodynamic stability and charge are used to quantify the                    
              influences of these molecular properties on reaction rate                      
              constants describing protein attachment and unfolding at each                  
              of a series of solid surfaces differing in hydrophobicity.                     
              Silicon surfaces will be modified by silanization with                         
              dichlorodimethylsilane, and in situ ellipsometry will be used                  
              to measure the adsorption kinetics and isotherm describing                     
              each specific protein- surface contact.  Upon completion of                    
              the project, current multi-protein adsorption models could be                  
              re-examined and refined by studying adsorption from mixtures                   
              of lysozyme mutants.  Experimentation with more relevant                       
              mixtures of proteins would then allow deviations from                          
              predicted behavior to be related to properties such as                         
              molecular size and shape in a more readily quantifiable way.                   
              This approach is expected to result in a sound starting point                  
              for quantifying competitive adsorption from complex media and                  
              may lead to new separation techniques.
