Abstract    :
              This award is part of the Arctic System Science (ARCSS) Program,               
              a U.S. Global Change Program.  The research project will focus on              
              integrated research that explores interactions between arctic                  
              terrestrial ecosystems and climate.  Field research will be                    
              related to measurements of tundra to determine the environmental               
              and vegetation correlates of fluxes of water, energy and trace                 
              gases especially carbon dioxide and methane. Field studies will                
              measure the movement of carbon dioxide and methane to and from                 
              the soil and vegetation in the Arctic.  This project is a                      
              component of a larger interdisciplinary program know as the ARCSS              
              FLUX Program.
