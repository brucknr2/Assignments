Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This proposal is a comparative study of the Guaja Indians of                   
              Maranhao state of Brazil, a people who, until recently, have                   
              little to no contact with local Brazilians.  The doctoral                      
              candidate will study three different communities which vary in                 
              their commitment to a n agricultural way of life.  If successful,              
              this study will help us to better understand the costs and                     
              benefits (health, diet, and resource usage) involved in the                    
              transition from a foraging way of life to a settled agricultural               
              mode of existence.  In addition, the research will shed important              
              data on the stability and adaptiveness of a foraging mode of                   
              existence in the tropics which has recently become a contentious               
              topic in ecological anthropology with important implications for               
              our understanding of hominid evolution.
