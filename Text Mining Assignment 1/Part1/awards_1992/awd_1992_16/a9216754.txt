Abstract    :
              This project in the Theoretical and Computational Chemistry                    
              Program of the Division of Chemistry involves two distinct but                 
              related advances in computational quantum chemistry.  The first                
              is the extension, testing, and calibration of a                                
              configuration-interaction method based on natural orbitals.                    
              The second is the application of the theoretical methods to                    
              answer a number of important molecular structural questions.                   
              The systems being studied include the ammonia dimer, triatomic                 
              halogen radicals, circulenes (hydrocarbons with seven hexagons                 
              surrounding a heptagon), and the cyclocarbinyl cation.                         
              %%%                                                                            
              Modern high-speed computers can be used to calculate the shapes                
              and energies of molecules, including those which have not as                   
              yet been synthesized.  In this study not only are the computer                 
              methods for carrying out these calculations being advanced, but                
              they are also being applied to the study of exotic molecules                   
              such as that formed by three chlorine atoms rather than by two                 
              atoms as in the more familiar chlorine molecule.
