Abstract    :
                   Control systems require intelligence to operate efficiently in            
              dynamical environment possessing a high degree of uncertainty.                 
              Successful autonomous operation in such situations can result from             
              a carefully designed interconnection of diverse information                    
              processing capabilities.  Such capabilities necessarily imply some             
              computational representation of the designer's view of what                    
              information is important and how it can produce the desire control             
              action.  Thus intelligent controllers give rise to dynamical                   
              systems defined on extended state spaces and their underlying                  
              algorithms amount to rules for tuning and switching in those space.            
              We propose to explore a unified mathematical framework for                     
              combining, in a stable manner various information processing                   
              capabilities in on-line settings.  We intend to explore in detail              
              two specific challenging application - an aircraft and a robot                 
              control problem - to provide the stimulus for our theoretical                  
              investigations.  Finally, we plan to devise a uniform architecture             
              for implementing the diverse information capabilities by the                   
              systematic use of artificial neural networks.
