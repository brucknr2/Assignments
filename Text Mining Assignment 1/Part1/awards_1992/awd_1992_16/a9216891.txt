Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Fine-scale physical measurements will be conducted on both sides of            
              the air-sea interface in the warm pool region of the Western                   
              Tropical Pacific. The goals of the study are to improve our                    
              understanding of the physical processes that control exchanges                 
              between the atmosphere and ocean during westerly wind bursts. These            
              measurements will take place during the intensive Observation                  
              Period of TOGA COARE between November 1, 1992 and March 1, 1993.               
              This work is a collaboration between a Russian scientist (Soloviev,            
              Shirshov Institute) and scientists from the U.S., France and the               
              U.K.
