Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This workshop will bring together experts from industry,                       
              universities, and government to review current systems software                
              and tools for high performance computing environments and to                   
              identify needed developments.  The workshop will indicate                      
              software development priorities and mechanisms for creating that               
              software.  The workshop will provide input to emerging HPCC                    
              research and development plans.
