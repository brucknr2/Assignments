Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This action is provide support for the Fifth Conference on                     
              the Neurobiology of Learning and Memory to be held in Irvine, CA               
              on October 22-24, 1992.  The general theme of this meeting,                    
              "Brain and Memory: Modulation and Mediation of Neuroplasticity"                
              is timely and of high importance to the field.   State-of-the-art              
              lectures will be given by internationally recognized                           
              investigators highlighting four exciting areas.  First, the                    
              relationship between emotion and memory will be examined.  The                 
              findings and theories examined in this session have implications               
              for understanding the role of motivation, emotion and stress in                
              learning and memory.  Second, recent findings and theory                       
              concerning age-related changes in brain and memory in animals and              
              humans will be explored.  The third session will focus on the                  
              plasticity in the cerebral cortex, which has received only                     
              limited attention to date but has long been recognized as the                  
              main processing structure and probably the ultimate forebrain                  
              storage site of memories.  Finally, the relationship between                   
              long-term potentiation and memory will be probed.  The format of               
              this conference will insure cross-fertilization of ideas on                    
              fundamentally important questions on how we learn and remember.                
              Some of the funds are to used for support of selected graduate                 
              and postdoctoral students who might overwise not be able to                    
              attend this outstanding conference.***//
