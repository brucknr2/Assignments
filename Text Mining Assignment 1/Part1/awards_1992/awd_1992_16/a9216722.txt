Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This project involves the dissertation research of a linguistic                
              anthropology student from the City University of New York,                     
              studying language socialization in the Marquesas.  The project                 
              involves a year-long ethnographic study of the beliefs and                     
              behaviors of a community of Polynesian-speaking Marquesans.  The               
              every-day interactions of several children, aged 2-5, will be                  
              observed and tape recorded.  The transcriptions will be analyzed               
              for evidence of how care givers socialize children into using                  
              Polynesian as the dominant language in the social construction of              
              Marquesan identity.                                                            
                                                                                             
              This project is important because this case study can help us                  
              understand the general processes involved in the maintenance of                
              an ethnic identity in a social situation where another language                
              and culture is politically dominant.  Understanding how ethnic                 
              identity is maintained can help us comprehend the sources of                   
              ethnic conflict in the modern world.
