Abstract    :
              The University of Maine seeks funding to purchase a scanning                   
              electron microscope (SEM) for its marine laboratory, the                       
              Darling Marine Center, for use by 1) resident faculty and                      
              students, 2) scientists at the nearby Bigelow Laboratory for                   
              Ocean Sciences, 3) numerous visiting investigators, and 4)                     
              members of MEDUSA, a consortium of over 60 Marine                              
              undergraduate marine science faculty who are given special                     
              access to the Center's facilities.  The SEM would support                      
              research by University faculty in residence involving the                      
              functional morphology of gametes and reproductive systems of                   
              shallow water and deep-sea invertebrates, comparative                          
              morphology, systematics, and phylogeny of crustaceans, the                     
              systematics and biology of coralline algae, studies of plant-                  
              herbivore interactions, the process of stromatolite                            
              formation by cyanobacteria, and  paleoecological studies of                    
              deep-sea foraminifers as part of global climate change                         
              research.  The SEM would be integrated into our summer                         
              teaching program to enrich existing courses and to establish                   
              new ones.  The instrument would be used to support  research                   
              by scientists at the Bigelow Laboratory's Center for Culture                   
              of Marine Phytoplankton to identify species of                                 
              dinoflagellates and diatoms used for resident research and                     
              supplied to other researchers throughout the world.  The SEM                   
              would also be used to support the diverse research of                          
              visiting investigators to the Center including invertebrate                    
              systematists supported under a new Marine Biodiveristy                         
              Program being developed at the Center.
