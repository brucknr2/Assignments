Abstract    :
              The objective of this research is to develop a design                          
              for an intelligent automatic generation control                                
              (AGC) for use on electric power systems.  Electric                             
              utilities use automatic generation control to balance                          
              their moment-to-moment electrical generation to                                
              load within a given control area.  The Southern                                
              Electric System uses a performance index to grade                              
              its power plants on automatic generation control.                              
              The average year-to-date performance index for 48                              
              coal-fired units is 57.9.  In-other-words, the units                           
              are not performing as well as desired on classical                             
              AGC.  This poor AGC performance is reflected in                                
              poor management of system resources and higher                                 
              costs.  The problem with the classical control                                 
              approach is that it does not have the ability to                               
              intelligently assess changes within the system it is                           
              attempting to control.  This research will explore                             
              two major areas in which to add intelligence to                                
              AGC - load forecasting and plant conditions.                                   
              Significant  improvements in AGC can be achieved                               
              through the integration of intelligent systems into                            
              the control system that can reason about the                                   
              dynamic changes in the load and the generation                                 
              facilities.
