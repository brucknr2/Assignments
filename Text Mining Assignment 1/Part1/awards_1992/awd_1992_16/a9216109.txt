Abstract    :
              This award is part of the Arctic System Science (ARCSS) Program,               
              a U.S. Global Change Program.  The research project will measure               
              the movement of carbon dioxide to and from the soil and                        
              vegetation in the Arctic.  The near-surface soil in the Arctic                 
              contains carbon equivalent to approximately 60 percent of the                  
              carbon currently in the Earth's atmosphere as carbon dioxide.                  
              Much of this carbon is stored in the soil as dead organic matter.              
              Its fate is subject to the net effects of global change on the                 
              plant and soil systems of northern ecosystems.  Recent findings                
              indicate that the arctic has become a source of atmospheric                    
              carbon dioxide.  This change coincides with recent climatic                    
              variation in the arctic, and suggests a positive feedback of                   
              arctic ecosystems on atmospheric carbon dioxide and global                     
              change.  The research will use enclosures, towers and aircraft to              
              make its measurements.  This project is a component of a larger                
              interdisciplinary program known as the ARCSS FLUX Program.
