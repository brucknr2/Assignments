Abstract    :
                   Professor Knize will use this SGER grant (small grants for                
              exploratory research) to investigate the optical properties of                 
              alkali vapors at very high pressure.  The technique is to make                 
              ultra-thin cells (less than one micron in thickness) filled with               
              alkali vapor.  Light transmission spectroscopy will be used to                 
              study predicted high-pressure transparency as the absorption                   
              coefficient reaches a constant value with increasing pressure.
