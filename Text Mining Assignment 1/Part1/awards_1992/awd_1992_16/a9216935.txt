Abstract    :
              9216935  Abramson  This program will assemble for the first time an HPLC and a
              continuous  flow isotope ratio mass spectrometer.  The component pieces are: 1.
              a  high performance liquid chromatograph (HPLC); 2. a Vestec Universal  HPLC/MS
              interface; 3. a chemical reaction interface (CRI); and 4. an  isotope ratio
              mass spectrometer system (IRMS).  This proposal emerges  from: the PI's
              development of the CRI; an extensive range of CRI-MS  applications using
              capillary gas chromatography coupled to conventional  mass spectrometers; and
              the recent development of an interface to the  CRI for HPLC that makes this
              approach possible.  The unique chemistry  of the CRI should improve l5N
              determinations compared with classical  combustion methods.  This type of
              instrument offers researchers who use  isotopes and IRMS an expanded range of
              target molecules including  intact biological polymers.  Compared to
              HPLC/conventional MS  approaches, 13C and l5N will be selectively detected at
              greatly reduced  isotopic abundance.  In addition, intact biological
              macromolecules can  be analyzed directly by the CRI-IRMS for isotopic
              quantitation.  This  will greatly improve analyses in biological systems where
              either 14C  would have been a tracer or where the tedious sequence of
              hydrolysis  followed by chromatographic separation and MS analysis of selected 
              monomers would be required.
