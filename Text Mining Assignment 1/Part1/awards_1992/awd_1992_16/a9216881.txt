Abstract    :
              This study will investigate the causes of earthquake injuries in               
              multi-story, reinforced concrete structures--one of the most                   
              lethal building types.  Specifically, injuries and fatalities                  
              will be studied that occurred during the 1990 Philippine                       
              earthquake.  This project comprises the analysis of already                    
              collected data, involving perspectives and methods from the                    
              fields of architecture, structural engineering, epidermiology and              
              emergency medicine.  The focus will be on the relationship                     
              between building performance, shaking intensity and occupant                   
              actions in the pattern of injuries.
