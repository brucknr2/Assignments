Abstract    :
              Dr. Chi Ho Mak is supported by a grant from the Theoretical                    
              and Computational Chemistry Program to study electron                          
              transfer reactions occurring in various chemical and                           
              biological systems.  Fully quantum mechanical theories will                    
              be used to study nuclear tunneling as manifested in the                        
              isotope effect in aqueous electron transfer reactions in the                   
              inverted region and highly nonadiabatic reactions in the                       
              normal region.  The mechanism of coherence-mediated                            
              transfers involving a possibly highly delocalized electron                     
              will be investigated by direct simulations to understand the                   
              spectroscopic properties of Creutz-Taube compounds.                            
              Finally, questions concerning the possible role of coherence                   
              and the effects of an intermediate state in the                                
              photosynthetic reaction center will be addressed by fully                      
              dynamical quantum Monte Carlo methods.                                         
              %%%                                                                            
              Electron transfer reactions are ubiquitous in many chemical                    
              and biological processes.  Underlying all oxidation                            
              reduction reactions is a process in which an electron is                       
              rapidly transferred from one chemical species to another.                      
              One very important electron transfer system occurs in the                      
              photosynthetic reaction center of plants and some bacteria.                    
              Since the electron is a very light particle these transfer                     
              processes must be treated using quantum theory to account                      
              for the nonclassical tunneling which takes place.  Mak's                       
              research will help to elucidate the quantum mechanical                         
              nature of this tunneling electron transfer process.
