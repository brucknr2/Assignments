Abstract    :
              This grant is for partial support of the                                       
              1992 International Ultrafast Phenomena                                         
              Conference, Antibes, France, June 8-12,                                        
              1992, the eighth in a series of meetings                                       
              on recent advances in research on                                              
              ultrafast phenomena.  These meetings are                                       
              the major international forum for                                              
              discussions of new ideas and methods in                                        
              this multidisciplinary and rapidly moving                                      
              field, which involves the technology of                                        
              generating ultrashort light pulses and                                         
              their application to studying ultrafast                                        
              processes in physics, chemistry, biology,                                      
              material sciences and electronics.  To                                         
              remain at the forefront of this field, the                                     
              U.S. conference organizers consider it                                         
              important that graduate students,                                              
              postdoctoral fellows and junior faculty                                        
              have the opportunity to attend this                                            
              international meeting.  NSF funds will                                         
              provide partial support of their travel.
