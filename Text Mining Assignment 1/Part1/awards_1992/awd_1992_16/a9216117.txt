Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Consumption of maarine snow (detrital aggregates>0.5 mm) by                    
              zooplankton has the potential to be one of the mosst                           
              significnt pathways altering the size distribution and                         
              abundance of large sinking particales in the ocean and has                     
              been hypothesized to be a major cause of the exponential                       
              decrease in particulate flux with depth below the mixed                        
              layer.  Yet almost nothing is known about the ability of                       
              pelagic animals to consume lare aggregates.                                    
                                                                                             
              We propose investigations of two of the potentially most                       
              important macrozooplankton consumers of marine snow,                           
              euphausiids and doliolids. Field observaations and                             
              preliminary experiments in our laboratory cleary demonstrate                   
              that these animals voraciouslly consume marine snow.  We                       
              propose to 1) quantify the consumption of marine snow by                       
              Euphausia pacifica and Doliioetta gegenbauri as  a function                    
              of the size, type and quality of aggregates offered, the                       
              size and hunger state of the animals, and the avialbility of                   
              alternate suspeended food sources, and 2) assess the impact                    
              of aggregate-conssuming macrozooplankton, especially                           
              vertically migrating euphausids, on the aabundance and                         
              vertical distripbution of marine snow in coastal surface                       
              water.
