Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                                                                                            
              The Ba content of the foraminifera shells that accumulate in deep-             
              sea sediments record past seawater Ba concentrations.  The unique              
              properties of Ba make it an effective tracer of deep-ocean                     
              circulation; in addition, paleo-Ba distributions are the best                  
              constraint presently available on alkalinity distributions in the              
              glacial oceans.  This study will 1) improve and augment the                    
              analytical method so that Ba, Cd, Mn, Sr and Ca can be analyzed                
              simultaneously in foraminifera; 2) acquire a long record (250 kyr              
              or more) of benthic foraminiferal Ba for Circumpolar Deep Water                
              (core RC13-229); 3) recover a long record (225 kyr) of benthic                 
              foraminiferal Ba for Pacific Deep Water (core TR163-31P); 4)                   
              recover a glacial-interglacial record of planktonic foraminiferal              
              Ba for the Southern Ocean (core AII107-22GGC); and, 5) expand the              
              map of benthic Ba distributions in the glacial oceans, with special            
              focus on the tropical Atlantic Ocean, Western Pacific Ocean and                
              intermediate waters of both the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans.
