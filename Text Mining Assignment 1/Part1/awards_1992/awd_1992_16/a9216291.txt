Abstract    :
              In this project the transient chemical and physical processes                  
              during electrokinetically enhanced contaminant transport in                    
              soils will be investigated to develop a predictive tool that                   
              could be applicable to complicated situations of soil                          
              contamination.  The investigation is composed of two                           
              phases: laboratory work and analytical work.  In laboratory                    
              work, simulated specimens of contaminated soil with heavy                      
              metals and organic substances will be subjected to long                        
              term electrokinetic tests.  In the analytical phase of                         
              the work, an existing model of second order kinetic approach                   
              for solute retention and transport in soils will be interfaced                 
              with an existing shell of an expert system augmented with                      
              the new data and base rules.  A prototype system will be                       
              developed which updates the initial conditions of the                          
              algorithmic model in time steps as pH, redox potential,                        
              and soil retention capacity changes in time and space.
