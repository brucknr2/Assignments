Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  The PIs propose to perform large-eddy simulations of the                  
              scalar and vector meteorological fields for an atmospheric surface             
              layer extending down to the surface through the canopy layer of                
              tall vegetation such as a forest.  The PI has completed and                    
              reported a pilot study of such a simulation.  The existing code,               
              which has run on a Cray Y-MP, will be the starting point for this              
              project.  The model equations solve a time-dependent, 3-dimensional            
              flow field with account taken for the drag of foliage elements and             
              for heat exchange between the air and vegetation.  The code will be            
              further developed for optimal simulation of the meteorology of the             
              forest, and output will be tested against published field                      
              observations, both in terms of statistical properties and the                  
              appearance of organized structures such as ejection/sweep motions              
              and resultant scalar ramps and other spatial patterns.  Computed               
              flow fields will be examined in an attempt to link large-scale                 
              vorticular structures to signatures observed in time traces at                 
              fixed points.  Simulations will be performed to determine the                  
              influence of forest heterogeneity, such as edge or forest                      
              clearing/gap effects on the calculated flow and scalar fields.
