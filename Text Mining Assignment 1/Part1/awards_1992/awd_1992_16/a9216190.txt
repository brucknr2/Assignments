Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This award provides partial travel support to 17 researchers                   
              from academia and industry to an interdisplinary workshop on                   
              ceramics, to be held on July 16-17, 1992, in Las Vegas.  Each                  
              participant will present a plenary session or a contributed                    
              paper.  The workshop will review the present state-of-the-art                  
              in the areas of ceramic powder processing by colloids,                         
              aerosols, combustion and other processes, and will discuss                     
              critical issues, needs and research opportunities in the                       
              future.  The strength of the meeting will be its                               
              interdisciplinary character, with contributions from different                 
              disciplines and from a large spectrum of industrial processes.                 
              It is expected that the preparation of this workshop in                        
              conjunction with the 23rd Annual meeting of the Fine Particle                  
              Society will enhance the participation of a representative                     
              group of scientists from the U.S. and abroad.                                  
              The workshop recommendations and final report will address                     
              research issues of interest to the scientific community in                     
              ceramic powder processing.  An assessment of the state-of-the-                 
              art world wide will be made at the conference.
