Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              A sequence stratigraphic study of the Neogene of Gulf of Mexico                
              which has high resolution seismics, well logs and continuously                 
              cored boreholes.  The results will be compared to a similar study              
              being undertaken along New Jersey margin and the recent sea-level              
              change and depositional models will be tested.
