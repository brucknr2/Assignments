Abstract    :
              An investigation of catalysis of homogeneous photochemical                     
              reactions and mechanisms of nucleophilic aromatic                              
              photosubstitution reactions will be conducted. By the                          
              determination of Bronsted Catalysis Law plots, evidence for                    
              electron hole transfer catalysis involving hydroxide ion will                  
              be obtained. In addition, the structural requirements which                    
              govern instances where base catalysis competes with quenching                  
              will be defined. The identity of intermediate structures                       
              involved in intramolecular photodisplacement of hydrogen on an                 
              aromatic ring will be determined, and for the first time the                   
              "element effect" on nucleophilic aromatic photosubstitution                    
              will be elucidated.                                                            
              %%%                                                                            
              This grant from the Organic Dynamics Program will suport                       
              research on photoinduced nucleophilic aromatic substitution in                 
              the laboratoty of Professor G. G. Wubbels at Washington                        
              College. The focus of the research will be to explore the                      
              nature of Bronsted Catalysis plots and thereby provide                         
              definitive evidence for electron hole catalysis involving                      
              hydroxide ion. Elucidation of the structural parameters which                  
              govern such processes will lead to the development of more                     
              efficient methods for generating substituted aromatic                          
              compounds.
