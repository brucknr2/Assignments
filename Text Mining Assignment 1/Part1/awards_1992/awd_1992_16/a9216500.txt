Abstract    :
              Experiments will be conducted in the millimeter and submillimeter              
              wave spectral range by using complementary experimental techniques             
              developed at UCLA and at the Institute of General Physics, Center              
              for Submillimeter Radiophysics, Moscow.  The focus is on the                   
              electrodynamics of various highly correlated solids in their Fermi             
              liquid, in the superconducting and density wave states.  These                 
              experiments are expected to give important information on both                 
              single particle and collective excitations.

              Optical experiments will be conducted at UCLA and at the Institute             
              of General Physics, Moscow, over a broad frequency spectrum by                 
              utilizing complementary instruments available at the two                       
              Institutions.  The optical conductivity and dielectric properties              
              of several new types of materials will be examined at different                
              temperatures.  New methods which will enable the measurement of                
              optical characteristics will also be developed.
