Abstract    :
              In this project, a new paradigm--system with set-partitioned                   
              dynamics is introduced. This paradigm encompasses a broad class                
              of control formulations motivated by applications to systems such              
              as industrial process, energy systems, and transportation                      
              vehicles. In this new paradigm, continuous but often uncertain                 
              dynamics of the system interacts with logical, although usually                
              fuzzy structure imposed by component limits and design                         
              constraints. The research  effort is devoted through analysis,                 
              design and experimental case studies, the formulation of an                    
              overall problem of controlling a plant whose behavior is                       
              determined not only by dynamics, but also by sharp or fuzzy                    
              boundaries on which these dynamics abruptly change. Design                     
              methods are developed for sharp and fuzzy partitioned observers,               
              and for interior and transitional controls. Estimation and                     
              control parts of the design are integrated into an overall                     
              numerical-logical feedback control loop.***//
