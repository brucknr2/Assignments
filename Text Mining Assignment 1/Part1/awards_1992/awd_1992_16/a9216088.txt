Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This project is a "small grant for exploratory research" project               
              that is part of a larger project studying parental behavior among              
              the Hadza of Tanzania.  Recently analyzed data suggest that                    
              mothers aged 30-45 seem to bear more children than mothers aged                
              20-30.  If so, this would be a surprising fact and counter to                  
              much anthropological-demographic theory.  This project involves a              
              few months fieldwork so that the investigator can interview women              
              on this past year's births and infant deaths, to insure higher                 
              quality information on this subject.                                           
                                                                                             
              This research is important because studies of births and                       
              parenthood among small-scale societies provide important                       
              comparative material on the human capacity to bear and rear                    
              children, to allow us to evaluate the importance of environmental              
              as compared with biologically-caused behaviors.
