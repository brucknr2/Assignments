Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                                                                                             
                                                                                            
              This project will determine the concentration and carbon isotopic              
              composition (d13C) of dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) in deep-sea             
              pore water, in order to provide a direct measure of the ratio of               
              organic carbon oxidation to CaCO3 dissolution in the sediments.                
              These data will be used to test the hypothesis that benthic organic            
              matter oxidation drives CaCO3 dissolution in sediments overlain by             
              bottom water which is supersaturated with respect to calcite.                  
              These study will be carried out in two separately-funded cruises               
              which are focused on the benthic carbon cycle.  This collaborative             
              effort will enable limitations in the existing pore water d13C data            
              to be overcome; at the same time, the d13C results will make a                 
              valuable contribution to these studies, by providing independent               
              estimates of the rate and vertical distribution of benthic CaCO3               
              dissolution.
