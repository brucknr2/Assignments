Abstract    :
                   This proposal is a request for funds to upgrade the                       
              electronics and the data processing capability of an existing nine-            
              year-old Bruker WM-400 MHz nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)                    
              spectrometer.  The five chemistry research groups that will be the             
              principal users of this instrument require NMR as an aid in their              
              organic and inorganic synthetic programs to identify products and              
              to determine product structures.  The proposed work requires a                 
              modern multinuclear NMR spectrometer with variable temperature and             
              sophisticated pulse control for current and future 2D FTNMR                    
              experiments.  The current instrument, which is the only research               
              grade NMR on the campus at Kansas State University, is nearly                  
              maximally booked, has a limited, obsolete data processing and data             
              storage system, and is encountering increasing difficultes in                  
              providing decoupled spectra or in performing DEPT, NOESY, and COSY             
              experiments upon demand.                                                       
                   Two of the four principal users are currently supported by                
              awards from the National Science Foundation.  Other faculty in the             
              departments of Chemistry, Biochemistry, Foods and Nutrition and                
              Grain Science will also benefit from this upgrade and they are                 
              listed as "other" users.

                   This proposal will assist in the purchase of a modern nuclear             
              magnetic resonance (NMR) spectrometer.  This instrument is an                  
              essential tool for faculty members at Kansas State University                  
              engaged in chemical research.  The instrument provides important               
              information which in most cases can be used to determine the                   
              geometric and/or molecular structure of newly synthesized                      
              molecules.
