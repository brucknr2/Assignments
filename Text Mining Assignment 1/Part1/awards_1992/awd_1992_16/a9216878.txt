Abstract    :
              The investigators will culture benthic foraminifera under                      
              controlled conditions of temperature, organic carbon concentration,            
              and isotopic composition in order to determine the controls on                 
              carbon isotope fractionation and burrowing behavior.  They will                
              collect live specimens from the upper continental slope, selecting             
              taxa used by paleoceanographers, culture them in mixed and                     
              monospecific populations with in situ measurement of pore-waters,              
              manipulate ambient temperature and pore-water chemistry, observe               
              burrowing behavior, and analyze isotopic composition and                       
              morphology.
