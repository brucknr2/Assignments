Abstract    :
              This project will provide support for delegates travel to attend               
              the Third International Conference on Ethics and Development to                
              be held in Tegucigalpa, Honduras, on June 21-27, 1992.  Colorado               
              State University and the International Development Ethics                      
              Association (IDEA) are the North American sponsors of the                      
              conference.  The theme is "The Ethics of Ecodevelopment:                       
              Culture, the Environment and Dependency."   Conference                         
              participants are expected to number 200, including 50 Hondurans.               
              IDEA is an interdisciplinary, cross-cultural group of 300                      
              philosophers, development theorists, and practitioners who apply               
              ethical reflection to national and international development                   
              goals and strategies and to the relations between the "North" and              
              the "South."  Among the Conference's distinctive aims are to                   
              promote a fruitful convergence of international development                    
              ethics and environmental ethics; to contribute to the formation                
              of a new paradigm of sustainable development; and to generate a                
              greater understanding of the actual and ideal relationships                    
              between biodiversity, cultural diversity, and sustainable                      
              development.  The immediate beneficiaries of these funds will be               
              participants from the Third World who otherwise would not be able              
              to attend the conference.  Other participants will benefit from                
              their exchange with these speakers about their understanding of                
              the problems of and solutions to species impoverishment,                       
              environmental degradation, and unjust development in both South                
              and North.  Besides articles, publications, and proceedings,                   
              results will include media interviews, newsletter and newspaper                
              articles, and further development of the international network of              
              theorists, analysts, decision makers, academic institutions and                
              stakeholder groups concerned about these issues.
