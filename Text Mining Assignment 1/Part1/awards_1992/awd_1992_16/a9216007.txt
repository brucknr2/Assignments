Abstract    :
              In this renewal grant theoretical research will focus on the                   
              effects of strong disorder and correlation in electron systems.                
              New results have been obtained for the fractional quantized Hall               
              state, particularly in confined geometry.  The overlap factor which            
              appears in tunnelling measurements has been calculated and the                 
              possible existence of a Fermi liquid state at half filling has been            
              explored.  The new work will build on this past work to further                
              study the properties of edge channels and the Aharonov-Bohm effect             
              in the fractional quantized Hall regime.                                       
              %%%                                                                            
              Theoretical research will be done on the fundamental properties of             
              the fractional quantized Hall state - a new state of matter                    
              exhibited by two-dimensional electron gases.  This special state of            
              matter is usually obtained at semiconductor interfaces in strong               
              magnetic fields.  The effects of strong disorder and correlation               
              among the electrons will be studied.  While contributing to basic              
              condensed matter physics,  there may be wider ramifications of this            
              work in microelectronics.
