Abstract    :
              In this project in the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program                 
              of the Chemistry Division, Kevin Lehmann of Princeton                          
              University will develop two spectroscopic tools to aid in                      
              studying intramolecular vibrational energy redistribution (IVR)                
              in small polyatomic molecules.  The first technique is an                      
              optical-optical double resonance method which allows very                      
              highly vibrationally excited levels of the ground state to be                  
              populated in order to study the effect of the large                            
              anharmonicity on the vibrational motion.  The other technique                  
              is a time-resolved, infrared-pump/Raman probe method for                       
              exploring the final IVR distributions after vibrational                        
              excitation of hydrogen atom stretches.  Finally, Lehmann will                  
              develop theoretical tools to interpret the newly acquired                      
              spectra.                                                                       
              %%%                                                                            
              An understanding of the effects of large amounts of vibrational                
              excitation in a molecule directly impacts our understanding of                 
              the fundamental processes by which many types of reactions                     
              occur.  In this research Lehmann will study the effects of                     
              vibrational energy on the motions of bonds in a molecule as                    
              well as the elucidation of the pathways by which this excess                   
              energy is dissipated.  This information has impact on the basic                
              understanding of many reactive processes, from atmospheric                     
              chemistry to combustion to synthesis using plasmas.
