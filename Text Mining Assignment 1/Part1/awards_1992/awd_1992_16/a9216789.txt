Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This work involves numerical experiments that will characterize the            
              yield strength of very young oceanic lithosphere by constraining               
              the numerical models to match existing observations.  Data from the            
              Gorda Ridge will be used to constrain the relative strengths of                
              lithosphere less than 2 Ma old, and 4-7 Ma old.  The models will               
              also test the physical factors controlling ridge-transform and                 
              overlapping spreading center geometry.  Finally, the loading                   
              imposed by near-ridge seamounts will be modeled.
