Abstract    :
                   Markov chain Monte Carlo methods will be applied to problems              
              in statistical inference with particular emphasis on spatial                   
              statistics and Bayesian computation.  This project is highly                   
              interdisciplinary with target areas that include image analysis,               
              whether from medical imaging, remote sensing or surface                        
              reconstruction and mapping, the analysis of data from                          
              agricultural experiments and from geographical epidemiology.                   
              There are general mathematical and computational implications for              
              difficult issues such as multi-modality and robustness in                      
              Bayesian posterior distributions.                                              
                   Markov chain Monte Carlo methods have a long history in                   
              statistical physics and subsequently in spatial statistics.  Now               
              these are being applied with spectacular success to a vast range               
              of mainstream statistical problems that have remained numerically              
              intractable otherwise.  This project, which is highly                          
              interdisciplinary because of the nature of spatial data and                    
              mapping problems, focuses on the solutions to some of the hardest              
              problems in the analysis of data which carry spatial                           
              connotations.
