Abstract    :
              The principal investigators propose                                            
              an investigation of interactions                                               
              between spatial and spectral degrees                                           
              of freedom in high bandwidth optical                                           
              systems.  Applications include high                                            
              speed communications and                                                       
              interconnections, adaptive signal                                              
              processing and spectroscopy.  Their                                            
              focus is on three systems concepts:                                            
              1)  Holographic spectral filtering;                                            
              2) Holographic mode shaping; and 3)                                            
              Holographic dispersion compensation.                                           
              Successful development of these                                                
              concepts relies on the development                                             
              novel materials, modulators and                                                
              detectors.
