Abstract    :
              This support will allow the Field Museum of Natural History to                 
              curate, computerize and incorporate a recent acquisition of an                 
              important research collection of molluscs, the 43,000-lot                      
              Hubricht collection.  The mullusc collection at the FMNH, with 4               
              million specimens in 296,000 lots, is one of teh largest in the                
              U.S. and is particularly strong in land snails.  The project will              
              have an important impact on research on land snails nationally                 
              and internationally.
