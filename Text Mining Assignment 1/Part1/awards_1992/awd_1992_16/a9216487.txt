Abstract    :
              The goal of an intelligent system is                                           
              to translate high level commands or                                            
              specifications automatically into                                              
              lower level actions upon the                                                   
              environment or "plant," while fully                                            
              utilizing any prior information as                                             
              well as the information contained in                                           
              the real time environmental                                                    
              responses.  Such an intelligent                                                
              system must interface between high                                             
              level specifications and low level                                             
              actions; between prior information                                             
              and real-time information which may                                            
              improve; modify or contradict it;                                              
              between discrete state or command                                              
              changes and continuous signals;                                                
              between inductive and deductive                                                
              learning; between real-time actions                                            
              and off-line decisions; between                                                
              various time scales of environmental                                           
              response; action and computation;                                              
              and between models, algorithms, and                                            
              architectures.                                                                 
                                                                                             
              At the highest level, the                                                      
              intelligent system must be able to                                             
              select classes of models within                                                
              which to describe the environment,                                             
              change between model classes or                                                
              models in response to environmental                                            
              changes such as failure modes or                                               
              disruptions, and finally refine the                                            
              parameters on-line to select a model                                           
              within a class.                                                                
                                                                                             
              At the operational level, consisting                                           
              of the core of an intelligent                                                  
              system, it must deal with the                                                  
              qualitative aspects of discrete and                                            
              continuous variables, data or                                                  
              actions, the temporal aspects of                                               
              multiple-time scales of                                                        
              environmental response, measurement                                            
              or action and the spatial aspects of                                           
              decentralized or distributed                                                   
              operation, information or control.                                             
              In the qualitative realm traversing                                            
              the purely discrete domain, one has                                            
              the issues arising from automata                                               
              theory and supervisory control for                                             
              reliable or safe operation of                                                  
              discrete event dynamics.  With the                                             
              introduction of time, one also has                                             
              the ability to model performance                                               
              measures such as cycle-time in                                                 
              manufacturing systems or throughput                                            
              in transportation systems.  This                                               
              leads to several scheduling and                                                
              optimization problems.                                                         
                                                                                             
              Finally, one has the implementation                                            
              layer of an intelligent system which                                           
              involves a unification of software,                                            
              algorithms whether parallel or                                                 
              sequential, computer architectures                                             
              and ultimately their mapping into                                              
              chips for the end user.  Thus this                                             
              layer gives rise to several issues                                             
              such as data structures and                                                    
              computer-aided-design.                                                         
                                                                                             
              While the above suggests a                                                     
              tripartite dissection of an                                                    
              intelligent system, our goal is to                                             
              nevertheless design it to be                                                   
              transparent to the end user, in a                                              
              fashion similar to the open systems                                            
              interconnection architecture.
