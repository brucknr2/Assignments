Abstract    :
                   This award, in the NSF/EPRI Initiative on Intelligent Control,            
              supports research on the integration of machine learning and                   
              sensor-based control in intelligent robotic systems.  The research             
              is interdisciplinary in nature and combines techniques of                      
              explanation-based control with robust and adaptive nonlinear                   
              control, computer vision, and motion planning.  The goal is to go              
              beyond the strict hierarchical control architectures typically                 
              found in robotic systems by integrating modeling, dynamics, and                
              control at all levels of intelligence.  Ultimately, techniques of              
              nonlinear dynamics and control will be combined with artificial                
              intelligence into a single new paradigm in which symbolic reasoning            
              holds an equal place with differential equation based modeling and             
              control. Both theoretical and experimental investigations will be              
              conducted.
