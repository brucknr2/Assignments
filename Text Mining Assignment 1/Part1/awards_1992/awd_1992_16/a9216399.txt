Abstract    :
                   This proposal addresses a novel form of gene regulation in                
              eukaryotes by asking how a circadian clock regulates the                       
              transcription of specific plant genes.  The study of clock-                    
              regulated transcription will provide an important insight into                 
              molecular genetic studies.  Transcription of the three Arabidopsis             
              Cab genes is differentially regulated by a circadian clock.  The               
              basis for this difference will be investigated by analyzing the                
              cis- and trans-acting factors that mediate the circadian response.             
              This will entail detailed in vitro analysis of specific DNA-protein            
              interactions using nuclear protein extracts prepared from different            
              time-points during the cycle.  The in vivo relevance of these                  
              interactions will be assessed by analysis of sites-specific                    
              constructs in transgenic plants.  In addition, novel circadian-                
              regulated marker genes will be identified and characterized by                 
              differential and subtractive hybridization.                                    
              %%%                                                                            
              Knowledge of how transcription is regulated by cellular clocks will            
              provide insight into a novel form of gene regulation in plants and             
              will, perhaps, provide information which can be extrapolated to                
              other organisms.
