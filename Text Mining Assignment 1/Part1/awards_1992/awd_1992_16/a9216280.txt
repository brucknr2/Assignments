Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Temperature is a primary determinant of the distribution of plants.            
              Tolerance limits of each species are genetically determined, and               
              can be extended through genetic adaptation.  High-temperature                  
              adaptation in terrestrial angiosperms has been shown to involve                
              changes in physiological and biochemical traits, resulting in                  
              greater thermal stability of photosynthesis and net carbon-                    
              fixation.  Mechanisms of adaptation will be examined in a marine               
              alga by comparing traits of a high-temperature tolerant ecotype of             
              the kelp, Laminaria saccharina, from Long Island Sound and a non               
              adapted population from Maine.  Adaptive changes in photosynthesis             
              vs. temperature responses of each ecotype will be examined in                  
              detail, including time-dependence and reversibility of heat damage,            
              and high-temperature induced photo inhibition.  Thermal responses              
              of dark respiration and photo respiration will also be compared for            
              each plant.  Thermal stability of photosystem II, the most heat-               
              sensitive component of photosynthesis, will be examined using                  
              chlorophyll fluorescence techniques.  Adaptive changes in key                  
              photosynthetic and respiratory enzymes will be determined by                   
              comparing thermal properties in vitro and by comparing activity in             
              plants exposed to superoptimal temperatures.  The results will                 
              provide the most comprehensive information to date about mechanisms            
              by which a marine alga can extend its temperature tolerance and,               
              thereby, its geographic and environmental ranges.
