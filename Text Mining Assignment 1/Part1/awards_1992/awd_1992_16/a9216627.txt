Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This proposal is a request for funds for 1993 to continue analyses             
              presently underway addressing issue of sediment transport on the               
              Amazon continental shelf. This sediment transport program is part              
              of the AmasSeds project (A Multi-disciplinary Amazon Shelf Sediment            
              Study) which began in 1989 and is scheduled to end in December                 
              1992.  We are requesting an additional year of support because: 1)             
              the success of the field program has exceeded expectations and has             
              resulted in not only a large data set but one that  has revealed               
              other important sedimentary processes (not considered in the                   
              original proposal) which also should be addressed; and 2) an                   
              additional year will provide time to synthesized the findings and              
              integrate results with those of the other four research groups                 
              involved in the project.
