Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This three-year award supports U.S.-France cooperative research in             
              chemical engineering between Peter A. Monson of the University                 
              of Massachusetts and Martin L. Rosinberg of the Pierre and Marie               
              Curie University in Paris.  The investigators propose theoretical              
              molecular studies on the adsorption of fluids in porous materials.             
              They will examine mixtures where significant nonideal behavior                 
              occurs in the bulk fluid state in order to understand how the                  
              behavior of the fluids are modified by confinement in porous                   
              materials.                                                                     
                                                                                             
              Both the U.S. and French research groups have longstanding                     
              research programs in the statistical mechanics of adsorption.  Dr.             
              Monson and his research team bring to this collaboration expertise             
              in Monte Carlo simulations of adsorption.  This is complemented                
              by Dr. Rosinberg's innovative theoretical approach based on                    
              density functional theory.  The work will be supplemented by                   
              integral equation theories and analytic solutions of one dimensional           
              models.  Their combined efforts are aimed at validating the                    
              potential of this theoretical approach through comparisons with the            
              results of Monte Carlo calculations.  The topic is timely and has              
              important technological applications ranging from adsorption                   
              separations to heterogeneous catalysis to modeling reservoir fluids            
              in enhanced oil recovery.
