Abstract    :
                   This Infrastructure Award provides computational                          
              infrastructure for use in the areas of video coding and image                  
              understanding and fast-turnaround system synthesis.  The former                
              research area requires massive data stores and special purpose                 
              video processors.  The latter area requires fast simulations.  The             
              infrastructure provided under this award includes both the special             
              purpose computational video equipment and storage devices and the              
              high speed workstations necessary for both research areas.                     
                                                                                             
                   Digital High Definition Television requires massive amounts of            
              memory and substantial processing power.  This infrastructure award            
              is providing research equipment for investigations into digital                
              video imaging and processing.  The award also provides for a                   
              collection of very high speed workstations for the rapid simulation            
              of computer systems.  This capability will allow these systems to              
              be much more rapidly developed.
