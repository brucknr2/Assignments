Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This project supports the dissertation research of an                          
              anthropology student from Columbia University in Japan.  The                   
              project is to test a theory of gender relations in white collar                
              organizations:  to assess the strength of cultural factors vs.                 
              organizational factors i explaining the discrimination against                 
              female workers in Japanese offices.  The student wil do                        
              participant observation in two Japanese business firms, one with               
              substantial numbersof women in professional positions and another              
              with few women in high level jobs.  By comparing behaviors,                    
              attitudes, life histories and professional aspirations of women                
              in the two case studies the student will attempt to assess the                 
              importance of internal values against external organizational                  
              barriers to advancement.                                                       
                                                                                             
              This project is important because Japanese business seems                      
              monolithically efficient and production oriented as seen from the              
              US.  This sort of case study will provide valuable information on              
              local variation and on barriers to participation by women, which               
              will be useful in dealing with Japanese public and private                     
              organizations.
