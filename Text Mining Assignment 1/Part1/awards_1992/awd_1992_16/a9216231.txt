Abstract    :
              This award is made as the starter grant increment of Dr. Evan                  
              Williams' postdoctoral research fellowship. A combination of                   
              capillary zone electrophoresis and Fourier transform mass                      
              spectrometry will be used to develop methods for the analysis                  
              of complex biological mixtures at the attomole level. The                      
              research involves the construction of instrumentation to do the                
              work, the development of experimental methodology to enhance                   
              sensitivity and minimize sample size, as well as the                           
              development of Hadamard transform methods which could lead to                  
              methods for rapid, simultaneous analyses.                                      
                                                                                             
                                                                                             
              %%%                                                                            
                                                                                             
              This research will develop methods for analysis of very complex                
              mixtures of biochemicals. Such techniques could have major                     
              impact on the early detection of disease and in forensic                       
              chemistry. The work is also important to basic research                        
              scientists who are studying metabolism and toxicity problems.
