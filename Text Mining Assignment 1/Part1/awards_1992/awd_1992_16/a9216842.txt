Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              It is proposed to continue a program of high-precision measurements            
              of the thermodynamic properties of superfluid helium three.  Four              
              studies are envisaged:  1) Resolve the discrepancy between                     
              measurements of the magnetization discontinuity at the A-B                     
              transition made by static (SQUID) and dynamic (NMR) techniques.  2)            
              Settle the issue of what is the microscopic order parameter of the             
              A phase.  3) Pursue study of the nature of the recently-discovered             
              phenomenon of superheating of the A-B phase transition.  4)                    
              Continue our effort to numerically model our measurements of                   
              hydrodynamics in the A phase.
