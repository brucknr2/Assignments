Abstract    :
              This research is directed toward the problem of extracting three-              
              dimensional circuit models from microcircuit and packaging layout              
              descriptions by using the newly developed Asymptotic Waveform                  
              Evaluation (AWE) technique to develop interconnect models in an                
              efficient manner.  Several features of AWE make this approach                  
              attractive:  a large speed-up over traditional interconnect                    
              extraction and simulation methods; the ability to perform efficient            
              time-domain sensitivity analysis; the capability to handle                     
              distributed elements without making a lumped model; an efficient               
              strategy for building macromodels of linear interconnect; and the              
              ease with which three-dimensional electromagnetic problems                     
              (involving distributed resistance, capacitance, inductance, as well            
              as retardation effects) can be handled.  AWE sensitivity analysis              
              helps to identify "critical" nets which must be extracted with                 
              detailed models; this should improve efficiency by allowing the                
              remaining nets to be treated more simply.                                      
                                                                                             
              The first task in this work is the efficient simulation of                     
              nonlinear circuits which contain high-speed interconnect by                    
              development of a simulation strategy which combines the benefits               
              of AWE for the linear portion of the circuit (interconnect) with               
              the generality of existing simulation algorithms for the nonlinear             
              circuit elements (such as transistors).  The second task is the                
              efficient extraction of accurate circuit models from three-                    
              dimensional interconnect geometry.  This is done in such a way that            
              the subsequent circuit simulation remains efficient.  Greater                  
              simulation efficiency is achieved by eliminating the detailed                  
              interconnect models and replacing them by macromodels.
