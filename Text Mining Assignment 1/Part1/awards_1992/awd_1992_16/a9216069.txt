Abstract    :
              The research aims to develop a definition of plastic strain for                
              finite deformations.  A set of multiaxial experiments will be                  
              conducted at large deformations to come out with a satisfactory                
              prescription of plastic strain.  The experiments will test the                 
              validity of a recently proposed, new, prescription of finite                   
              plastic strain.
