Abstract    :
              9216340  Prinn       This is a broad-based research project focused on the 
              chemistry and chemical evolution of the atmospheres Earth and other  planets. 
              The work involves development of chemical-dynamical  atmospheric models,
              measurements of atmospheric constituents  focussing on hydrocarbons (gas
              chromatography) and hydroxyl  radicals (active titration), and development of a
              unified theory  for the origin of atmospheres.       The principal areas in the
              research program are:  (a) Field measurements of nonmethane hydrocarbons (gas 
              chromatography) and hydroxyl radical (active titration) as  contributions to
              the International Global Atmospheric Chemistry  (IGAC) Project.  (b)
              Development of chemical-dynamical atmospheric models and  biogeochemical
              cycling models to aid interpretation of data  obtained in (a).  (c) Studies of
              the current state and origin and evolution of  planetary atmospheres including
              effects of large collisions and  surface-atmosphere reactions, and taking into
              account early solar  system processes determining initial planetary volatile
              contents.
