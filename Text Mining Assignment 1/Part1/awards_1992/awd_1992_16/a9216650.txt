Abstract    :
                   The principal investigator will continue his investigation                
              of the G-theory of group rings and K-theory using Yao's                        
              noncommutative localization theorem. He will also continue his                 
              research in spectral geometry. In particular he will study                     
              Riemannian orbifolds and geometric invariants which detect                     
              isospectral deformations.                                                      
                   This award will support research in the general area of                   
              differential geometry and global analysis. Differential geometry               
              is the study of the relationship between the geometry of a space               
              and analytic concepts defined on the space. Global analysis is                 
              the study of the overall geometric and topological properties of               
              a space by piecing together local information. Applications of                 
              these areas of mathematics in other sciences include the                       
              structure of complicated molecules, liquid-gas boundaries, and                 
              the large scale structure of the universe.
