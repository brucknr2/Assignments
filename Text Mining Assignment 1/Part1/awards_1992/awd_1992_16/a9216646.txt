Abstract    :
              92166646  Turco       This research project will continue the establishment of a
               comprehensive modeling capability for tropospheric heterogenous  chemical
              processes and effects.  A hierarchy of models will be  developed to study
              systematically the chemical phenomena occurring  on aerosol and cloud
              particles.  The models will treat the basic  physical and chemical processes of
              gas-particles.  The models will  treat the basic physical and chemical
              processes of gas-particle  interactions, which will be calibrated using
              laboratory and field  data.  The heterogenous physics and chemistry models will
              be  coupled to models that simulate atmospheric dynamics (and radiative 
              transfer), allowing applications to problems including the  evolution of
              sulfate aerosols in the marine boundary layer, the  chemistry that occurs on
              ice in cirrus clouds, and the relationship  of atmospheric chemistry that
              occurs on ice in cirrus clouds, and  the relationship of atmospheric chemistry
              to cloud radiative  effects.  These models will be unique in several respects. 
              They  will be based on fundamental processes -- for example, nucleation  and
              surface adsorption -- to achieve more realistic mechanistic  treatments of
              heterogenous processes than are presently used.  The  models will be more
              quantitative in defining coupled physical and  chemical processes, and will be
              designed for integration into  comprehensive tropospheric chemistry
              simulations.  This research  program emphasizes model development and student
              training in  atmospheric chemistry and climate.
