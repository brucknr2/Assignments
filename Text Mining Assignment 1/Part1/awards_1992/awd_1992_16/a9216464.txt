Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This project supports the dissertation research of an                          
              anthropology student from the University of Michigan in Nepal.                 
              The project will examine changes in behavior and values                        
              associated with changes in marriage practices.  A case study will              
              be done of a small, traditional rural community where marriages                
              have recently changed from arranged to individually initiated                  
              relationships.  Using ethnographic methods of participant                      
              observation, a community survey and intensive interviews, the                  
              student will examine how behavior associated with individually                 
              initiated marriages modifies the community social and authority                
              structures.                                                                    
                                                                                             
              This research is important because marriage changes similar to                 
              those studied have occurred, and continue to occur in many                     
              regions of the world.  Increased comprehension of the impact of                
              these changes on local communities helps us understand sources of              
              conflict and change.
