Abstract    :
              In this project, the Principal Investigator will collect water                 
              samples for analysis of Tritium and Helium content along                       
              hydrographic lines designated by the World Ocean Circulation                   
              Experiment (WOCE) as P-17N and P-14N in the North Pacific.  The                
              measured distribution of these tracers would be combined with                  
              hydrographic and other tracer information to study the general                 
              circulation of the North Pacific.
