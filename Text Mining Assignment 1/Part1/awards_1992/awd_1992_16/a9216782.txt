Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                                                                                             
                                                                                            
              This is a U.S.-Poland research project between Drs. Stanislaw J.               
              Szarek and Elisabeth Werner of Case Western Reserve University                 
              and Drs. Aleksander Pelczynski, Tadeusz Figiel, Piotr Mankiewicz               
              of IMPAN, Polish Academy of Sciences, and Wojciech Banaszczyk                  
              of Lodz University.  The researchers plan to explore some                      
              geometric aspects of functional analysis:  convexity, the operator             
              theory, and the interplay between the two.  In both areas they                 
              intend to focus on the so-called "local" or "finite dimensional"               
              theory.                                                                        
                                                                                             
              This project in mathematics fulfills the program objective of                  
              advancing scientific knowledge by enabling leading experts in the              
              United States and Eastern Europe to combine complementary                      
              talents and pool resources in areas of strong mutual interest and              
              competence.
