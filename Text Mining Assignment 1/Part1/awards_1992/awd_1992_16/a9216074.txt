Abstract    :
              One of the most pressing problems, and hence most influential                  
              factors in future computer architectures is the growing disparity              
              in the performance of processors and affordable (DRAM) memories.               
              A workshop of experts is convened on the full spectrum of issues               
              relevant to this problem-including at least chip technology,                   
              architecture, caching, new concepts in memory hierarchy, compiler              
              optimization, programming techniques, and algorithms.  The                     
              objective of the workshop is to assay the problem and suggest                  
              research agenda for the various areas bearing on the issue.  A                 
              report of the results of the workshop will be published.
