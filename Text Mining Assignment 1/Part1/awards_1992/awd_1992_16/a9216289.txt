Abstract    :
                   This is a project on the control of asynchronous transfer mode            
              (ATM) networks and of optical networks.  We focus on three sets of             
              issues central to the operations of high speed networks:                       
                   Traffic shaping for ATM networks                                          
                   Multiplexing for optical networks                                         
                    Feedback control with delayed information                                
                   We will use the limit results for fast and large networks to              
              analyze these three sets of issues.  Specifically, we will use                 
              fluid and diffusion limits and large deviation bounds.  For traffic            
              shaping we will use a new strategy (periodic averaging of rate).               
              We believe this strategy can reduce significantly the amount of                
              queuing required inside the network, and that this strategy can                
              simplify both the design and control of networks.  the multiplexing            
              approach that we will study for optical networks is statistical                
              look-ahead multiplexing.  This multiplexing approach is designed               
              for star optical networks.  It uses the connectivity properties of             
              these networks but does not require tunable lasers or filters.  The            
              objectives in the study of feedback control with information delay             
              are to identify the feedback control strategies that can improve               
              the operations of high speed networks and quantify the gain                    
              achieved by these strategies.
