Abstract    :
              The theme of the proposed research is to advance                               
              the state of the art in the design of feedback                                 
              controllers.  This basic research will integrate                               
              concepts from deterministic and stochastic optimal                             
              control theory and intelligent control methodologies                           
              to arrive at superior intelligent feedback designs.                            
              More specifically it is proposed to utilize  neural                            
              network technology to implement the design of                                  
              optimal, robust, and adaptive nonlinear controllers                            
              in the presence of significant un certainty.  The                              
              emphasis will be on basic theoretical and                                      
              algorithmic results.  Specific research directions                             
              include the use of optimal control theory as a                                 
              means for training artificial neural network                                   
              implementations of linear, nonlinear, and adaptive                             
              controllers.  One approach will involve the use of                             
              numerical data from the solution of the Two-Point-                             
              Boundary-Value (TPBV) problem arising from the                                 
              application of the Pontryagin Maximum Principle to                             
              firs train artificial neural network feedback                                  
              controllers and then evaluate their performance.  In                           
              particular, we shall examine whether Cerebellar                                
              Motion Articulated Controller (CMAC) structures                                
              can be viewed from  this perspective.  In the                                  
              beginning phase we plan to use bang-bang time-                                 
              optimal nonlinear controllers for low order systems                            
              and investigate the degree that a trained multi-layer                          
              neural network approximates the switching curves                               
              and surfaces associated with these bang-bang                                   
              controllers.
