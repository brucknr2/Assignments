Abstract    :
              The Oregon Graduate Institute of Science & Technology has                      
              operated a Raman spectroscopy laboratory since 1970 with an                    
              outstanding record of national and international research                      
              accomplishments in chemistry and bioinorganic chemistry.                       
              Members of the Department of Chemical & Biological Sciences                    
              propose a major upgrade of the instrument through the                          
              acquisition of a Raman spectrometer equipped with a charge-                    
              coupled device (CCD) detector and customized sample-handing                    
              optics.  Preliminary tests have shown that the improvement                     
              in signal-to-noise of a CCD-equipped instrument over a                         
              single-channel spectrophotometer ranges from 20 to 50.  This                   
              translates into an increase in light-gathering power by the                    
              square of the S/N, or 400- to 2500-fold.  The new                              
              instrumentation will significantly increase spectral                           
              quality, reduce data collection times, and permit the use of                   
              much lower laser power.  In conventional resonance Raman                       
              spectroscopy, laser-induced sample damage limits the utility                   
              of signal averaging.  Experiments will be possible with the                    
              CCD detector that cannot now be performed, and include                         
              research on (1) the catalytic mechanism of cytochrome d                        
              oxidase, (2) the biochemistry of  lignin-degrading                             
              peroxidases, (3) the structure of cupredoxins having                           
              isotopically labeled ligands and site-directed ligand                          
              mutations, (4) the structure and reactivity of novel                           
              quinone redox cofactors, (5) the role of b-cytochromes in                      
              phogocytic cells, (6) the inorganic chemistry of water-                        
              slitting catalysts, and (7) ligand-directed spectroscopy of                    
              copper mono-oxygenases.
