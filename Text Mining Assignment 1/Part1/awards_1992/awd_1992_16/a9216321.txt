Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This award is for the acquisition of a network testbed for the                 
              experimental networking and distributed database research at the               
              University of Southern California.  The primary research activities            
              are concentrated in two main areas:  Network Control Protocols and             
              Distributed Databases.  The main feature that these two diverse                
              research areas share is a need to (1) solve problems involving                 
              multiple nodes, (2) complement existing modeling, simulation,                  
              emulation, and small scale implementations with multi-node                     
              prototypes, (3) isolate the resulting network from the campus                  
              production network, and (4) employ a support staff to maintain and             
              operate the network.                                                           
                                                                                             
              The study of distributed networks is important because of the wide             
              availability of inexpensive workstations that can be easily linked             
              together.  Not so easy is how to utilize these networks                        
              effectively.  The study of network protocols is critical to this               
              task as is the study of distributed databases.  This award supports            
              both areas.
