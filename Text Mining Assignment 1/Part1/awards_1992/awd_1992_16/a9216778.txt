Abstract    :
                   187Re is a radioactive isotope that decays with a half-                   
              life of about 4.6x1010 years to 187Os.  The 187Os of a                         
              system depends on the age of that system, the initial                          
              187Os/186Os ratio and the 187Re/186Os (where 186Os is used                     
              as the non-radiogenic osmium tracer).   The continental                        
              crust has 187Re/186Os about 100 times higher than the mantle                   
              so that the 187Os/186Os of the average continental crust                       
              with a mean age of about 20 billion years is about 10.5                        
              whereas osmium immediately derived from the mantle has a                       
              value of about 1.  The seawater 187Os/186Os of 8.5 implies                     
              that 80% of the present-day osmium supplied to the sea comes                   
              from the continents and 20% from oceanic mantle sources.                       
              This ratio of sources is expected to vary over time based on                   
              the marine 87Sr/86Sr record.  The hydrogenous fraction of                      
              oxidized deep-sea sediments and organic-rich reduced                           
              deposits from stratigraphically dated systems can provide                      
              records of past seawater 187Os/186Os.  The "giant piston                       
              core" from the central North pacific (LL GPC-3) and material                   
              from DSDP and ODP cores are ready sources for the study.                       
              The procedures involving leaching of the hydrogenous                           
              fraction of oxidized cores using dilute hydrogen peroxide                      
              have been developed.  Preliminary results shows a first                        
              order correlation with the marine 97Sr/86Sr record                             
              indicating that the relative roles of continental and                          
              oceanic mantle source affect both elements.  Imposed on this                   
              effect is the inverse relationship between 87Sr/86Sr and                       
              187Os/186Os in the latest Pleistocene indicating different                     
              sources for the two elements.  We will explore the full                        
              187Os/186Os seawater record over the past 100 million years,                   
              compare it with the known 87Sr/86Sr record and thereby to                      
              add to our understanding of the relationship of two                            
              different isotopic signatures to the geologic record of                        
              alteration and weathering.
