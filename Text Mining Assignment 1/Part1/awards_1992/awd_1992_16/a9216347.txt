Abstract    :
              The Unalakleet River corridor in Western Alaska presents unusual               
              opportunities for analyzing cultural adaptation and change. In                 
              spite of the influences of Western culture, and the adoption of                
              new technologies, cultural conservatism among Native groups                    
              persisted, and could be a source of social conflict. This                      
              dissertation examines how change is manifested in small groups                 
              (households) at the time of Euro/American contact. A 19th century              
              village is examined in detail through excavation, artifact and                 
              architectural analysis. The data will contribute to a clearer                  
              understanding of stability and change among Native Americans in                
              general and Native Alaskans in particular.
