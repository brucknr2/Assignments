Abstract    :
              The objective of this research is to develop a computational                   
              method for assessing the safety of underground facilities in                   
              jointed rock under various types of catastrophic loads. The model              
              will be based on three dimensional deformable blocks in which the              
              rock is represented by deformable elements and the joints are                  
              represented by interfaces. Models for dilatory joint behavior and              
              asperity degradation during cyclic deformation will be included                
              in the model. The models will be integrated in time by explicit                
              integration. The computer program will be implemented on                       
              massively parallel computers so that realistic three dimensional               
              models can be solved in a reasonable amount of computation time.
