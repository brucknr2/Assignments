Abstract    :
                   Recent theoretical and observational studies by the principal             
              investigator and others support the view that cyclogenesis                     
              represents the rapid transient growth of favorably configured, or              
              "optimal", perturbations of atmospheric flow.  Results suggest that            
              elements of this theoretical model may have wider application,                 
              namely, to the origin of synoptic scale waves and the maintenance              
              of their variance in simple flows.  This also could extend to the              
              role of spatial and temporal flow inhomogeneity in organizing                  
              variance into storm tracks.  Dr. Farrell will employ the stochastic            
              dynamic equations associated with the barotropic and quasi-                    
              geostrophic models for this investigation.                                     
                   In addition, Dr. Farrell will continue his investigations into            
              the limits of predictability of atmospheric flows using optimal                
              perturbation techniques.  He seeks to clarify the role of the                  
              background flow in determining the rate of perturbation growth (and            
              decreased predictability).  This area of research has important                
              implications for, and potential to improve, weather forecasting.
