Abstract    :
              This project explores the                                                      
              possibility of an acoustic                                                     
              transmission system to enable real-                                            
              time monitoring of remote ocean                                                
              bottom sites with video images from                                            
              untethered vehicles.  The key issue                                            
              is matching the image transmission                                             
              rate and image quality to the                                                  
              capabilities of the acoustic                                                   
              telemetry links, while preserving                                              
              the salient image qualities which                                              
              make the information useful to the                                             
              scientist or vehicle controller.                                               
              We will develop an integrated video                                            
              compression and acoustic telemetry                                             
              system to allow an AUV to perform                                              
              tasks such as a rapid search of an                                             
              area, closer examination for object                                            
              classification, and finally,                                                   
              transmission of archival quality                                               
              images for detail study and                                                    
              documentation.                                                                 
                                                                                             
              The project will also investigate                                              
              user feedback to the remote camera,                                            
              involving issues such as strobe                                                
              control, image quality adjustment,                                             
              and vehicle position.  We propose                                              
              to integrate the process into an                                               
              adaptive video protocol designed                                               
              explicitly for remote AUVs.  The                                               
              protocol will be optimized for                                                 
              issues such as long propagation                                                
              delays inherent in acoustic                                                    
              telemetry and limited information                                              
              bandwidth.  An important goal is                                               
              matching the compression algorithms                                            
              to the actual, science-driven                                                  
              requirements encountered when using                                            
              AUVs for scientific observation.
