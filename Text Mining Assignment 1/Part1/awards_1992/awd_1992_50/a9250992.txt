Abstract    :
              MiraCosta College has instituted a new vocational education                    
              certificate program in biotechnology as a result of student and                
              industry demand. The certificate program is designed around the                
              existing curricula at MiraCosta College with the addition of                   
              two courses specifically focused on biotechnology.  One of                     
              these courses, Methods in Biotechnology will require students                  
              to conduct laboratory experiments that teach the underlying                    
              molecular biology concepts and techniques essential to                         
              biotechnology.
