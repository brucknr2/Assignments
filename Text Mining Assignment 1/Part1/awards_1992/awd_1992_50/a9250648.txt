Abstract    :
              This project incorporates programmable logic control equipment                 
              into the instrumentation and motor control laboratory.  Used in                
              conjunction with the existing pneumatic trainers, boiler                       
              control panels, flow, level, pressure, and temperature process                 
              stations, process control plant simulator and motor control                    
              circuits, the state-of-the-art programmable logic control                      
              workstations allows students to directly apply their                           
              understanding of theories presented in class.  This also allows                
              students the opportunity to be exposed to practical                            
              applications and experimentation with programmable logic                       
              control equipment and  instrumentation.
