Abstract    :
              The new equipment (phase contrast microscopes, microscopes                     
              equipped for fluorescence, photomicroscopy, and video analysis)                
              will permit an upgrading of the cell biology laboratory in                     
              three specific ways:  (1) New experiments and exercises are now                
              possible.  These include but are not limited to, a microscope                  
              techniques exercise, detailed analysis of amoeboid and                         
              flagellar (ciliary) movement, cytochemistry, protoplast                        
              isolation and manipulation, and muscle contraction.  (2) The                   
              new equipment will permit the inclusion of student projects as                 
              a focal point for the course.  (3) Several current experiments                 
              will also improve by allowing for greater image resolution,                    
              fluorescent staining of certain cell components and                            
              quantitation.  These experiments include mitosis and cell cycle                
              analysis, flagellar regeneration studies, cytoplasmic streaming                
              analysis, and plant nuclei isolation.  The microscope equipment                
              will have the largest impact on Cell Biology students.  In                     
              addition, the Developmental Biology course and the Senior                      
              Research course will benefit.
