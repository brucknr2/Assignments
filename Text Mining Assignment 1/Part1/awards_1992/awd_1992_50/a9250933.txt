Abstract    :
              The project enhances the existing computer-aided mapping and                   
              geographical information systems (GIS) laboratory capability in                
              civil engineering at Cal Poly Pomona.  Seven surveying                         
              workstations are enhanced by the addition of an analytical                     
              plotter and UNIX-based workstations, equipped with GIS                         
              software.  The analytical plotter is used in the photogrammetry                
              class to teach students the principles of analytical                           
              photogrammetry and photogrammetric data collection methods for                 
              GIS databases.  The UNIX-based workstations is used in the GIS                 
              class to teach students the topological principles involved in                 
              geographical information systems.
