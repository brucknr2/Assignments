Abstract    :
              A Computational Physics Laboratory has been equipped with ten                  
              microcomputers networked to a server with a variety of software                
              for use by all physics majors at Ohio University.  The                         
              laboratory is a crucial part of our plan to integrate the                      
              computer into the undergraduate physics curriculum at all                      
              levels.  The goal is to use computers (their power,                            
              flexibility, and graphics) as a tool to aid in conceptualizing                 
              physics.  The conceptual insight provided by computer                          
              simulations and exercises stimulates the imagination of our                    
              physics majors, leading to improved retention and better                       
              prepared graduates.  We are using existing software whenever                   
              possible, and are serving as a testing site for the (NSF                       
              funded) CUPS program of software development for upper-level                   
              physics courses.  Software based on a common set of utilities                  
              provided by CUPS and MUPPET is also being developed.  We                       
              believe the correlated introduction of computers into physics                  
              courses will have a profound effect on the quality of physics                  
              graduates and future physics curricula.
