Abstract    :
              The goal of the project is to introduce computer- and video-                   
              based image acquisition and processing into undergraduate                      
              laboratory and field exercises, and especially to introduce a                  
              variety of quantitative image analysis methods into those                      
              laboratories. The specific laboratory exercises affected                       
              include: (1) protist competition and predator-prey interactions                
              using software for cell identification and counting; (2)                       
              identification of invertebrate nerve cells during intracellular                
              recording using simple imaging and object measurement                          
              techniques; (3) testing of theories of growth and development                  
              using computer morpho-metric techniques; and (4) quantification                
              of organism distribution patterns.  Laboratory exercises are                   
              under development that focus on the use of digital image                       
              processing in animal behavior studies.
