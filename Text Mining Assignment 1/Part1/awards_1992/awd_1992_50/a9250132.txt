Abstract    :
              This project establishes an undergraduate digital signal                       
              processing (DSP) laboratory supporting two new courses, a                      
              junior filter design course and a senior DSP course, and a                     
              year-long senior electrical design sequence.  The laboratory                   
              consists of eight 486 PC workstations equipped with high                       
              resolution video boards.  Hardware and software for color image                
              capture and display as well as audio segment capture and replay                
              are being installed in the lab.  A digital filter design                       
              package and a Motorola 56000 development system are also used                  
              in the lab.This project represents an example which other small                
              engineering schools could follow in developing a cost conscious                
              DSP program.  The feasibility of using a 486 (or 386) PC for                   
              such a laboratory has been established by prior work.
