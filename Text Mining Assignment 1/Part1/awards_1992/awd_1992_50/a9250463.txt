Abstract    :
              A laboratory in Automated Data Collection and Identification                   
              (ADC&I) is being developed to provide students with experience                 
              in  barcode, radio frequency, magnetic stripe, machine vision,                 
              and voice recognition technologies and their integration into                  
              industrial systems.  Students gain familiarity with symbology                  
              standards, print quality analysis methods, design of ADC&I                     
              databases, design of systems to track work-in-progress, and                    
              evaluation procedures for selecting different ADC&I                            
              technologies.  This laboratory supports courses in CAD, CAM,                   
              and Production & Inventory Control.  A separate course in                      
              Automated Identification is planned for addition into the                      
              undergraduate engineering curriculum.
