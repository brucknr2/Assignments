Abstract    :
              Recent modernization of the department's seismology laboratory                 
              and the addition of a faculty member interested in research and                
              instruction in geophysics has permitted expansion of student                   
              research opportunities into this field.  Global Positioning                    
              System (GPS) satellite geodetic instruments are at the                         
              forefront of science and technology.  These instruments are                    
              being used by undergraduate students to examine crustal                        
              deformation related to tectonic processes.  Students                           
              participate in faculty-sponsored research projects, including                  
              the publication of results in professional journals.  In the                   
              Introduction to Geophysics course, students are involved in                    
              projects studying the strain and uplift of the San Gabriel                     
              Range, measuring of deformation in connection with the San Jose                
              and San Andreas faults, and analyzing data related to tectonic                 
              deformation throughout the Transverse Ranges.
