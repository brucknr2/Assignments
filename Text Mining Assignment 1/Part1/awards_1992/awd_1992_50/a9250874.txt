Abstract    :
              Acquisition of scanning UV-visible spectrophotometers will                     
              result in a significant upgrading of the undergraduate                         
              biochemistry laboratory program.  While laboratory experience                  
              is an integral and important part of undergraduate biochemistry                
              education at Cal State L.A., experiments involving modern UV-                  
              visible spectrophotometry have not been implemented due to a                   
              lack of appropriate instrumentation.  The new equipment will                   
              allow development of spectroscopy-based experiments that                       
              familiarize students with modern techniques and concepts                       
              relating to the structure and function of nucleic acids and                    
              proteins.
