Abstract    :
              A computer laboratory environment is being developed which will                
              encourage active, exploratory student involvement in course                    
              content and the learning process.  The laboratory enhances                     
              existing courses for first- and second-year students in                        
              Biology, Mathematics and Computer Sciences, thus addressing                    
              recommended curricular changes in these disciplines. Closed                    
              Computer Sciences labs for programming design and analysis are                 
              being developed Mathematics students have investigatory                        
              capabilities for constructive problem solving, visualization of                
              functions and the study of patterns.  Still and motion imagery                 
              recorded in Biology labs, as well as images from other media                   
              (videodiscs, CD-ROM, print), are compressed and stored in a                    
              library on the network's server to be used in student exercises                
              for comparison and analysis during closed laboratory sessions.
