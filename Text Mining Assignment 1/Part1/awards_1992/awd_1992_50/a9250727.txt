Abstract    :
              The Department of Chemistry is purchasing a 60 MHz FT-NMR for                  
              use in several laboratory courses in which are heavily                         
              dependant on spectroscopic techniques, including microscale                    
              organic laboratory, physical chemistry laboratory, and                         
              instrumental analysis.  The new instrument with is enhancing                   
              the laboratory experience of our students by permitting a                      
              conversion of the organic chemistry laboratory to microscale                   
              techniques.  Students obtain carbon-13 Free Induction Decay                    
              (FID) spectra on their recation products by modem from a                       
              neighboring university,  convert them to frequency domain                      
              spectra and subject them to any desired analysis.  The                         
              instrument is also being used by students undertaking                          
              independent research.
