Abstract    :
              This project offers a new hands-on laboratory course in                        
              Advanced Ceramics Processing, to complement the lecture course                 
              that is now required.  The laboratory offers a distinctly                      
              hands-on course as an elective to be taken by over 40 students                 
              each year.  To accomplish this, three high-quality, durable,                   
              user-friendly items of equipment are being acquired.  A zeta                   
              potential analyzer quantitatively characterizes the                            
              interactions between particles.  A spray dryer provides                        
              experiments in various powder preparation methods and for the                  
              preparation of special powders.  An injection molding apparatus                
              enables students to explore the variables and fabricate small                  
              items using the injection molding process.  These experiments                  
              are combined with others that can be performed with presently                  
              available equipment.  This project has two major pedagogical                   
              effects: (1) the students are able to extend classroom ideas to                
              a hands-on laboratory experience; and (2) a stronger                           
              processing-properties relationship is established.These                        
              equipment items bring to a critical mass the amount of                         
              equipment needed to offer this important laboratory course in                  
              advanced ceramics processing.
