Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                                                                                            
              The California Advocacy for Mathematics and Science (CAMS)                     
              initiative will bring together top-level leadership from the                   
              State Superintendent of Public Instruction and the                             
              Governor's Office of Child Development and Education in                        
              support of improving mathematics and science education with                    
              an emphasis on full participation for underrepresented                         
              groups.  The CAMS initiative addresses several barriers to                     
              improvement of K-6 science and middle grades mathematics                       
              programs in the state.  The program has three objectives:                      
                                                                                             
              1.   Galvanizing public support for improving mathematics                      
                   and science education.                                                    
                                                                                             
              2.   Developing and promoting elementary science                               
                   instruction.                                                              
                                                                                             
              3.   Replacing the usual curriculum and instructional                          
                   features of middle grades mathematics instruction with                    
                   materials and activities consistent with NCTM                             
                   Standards.                                                                
                                                                                             
              The CAMS initiative will make use of special meetings with                     
              policymakers, business and community leaders, and educators                    
              to heighten public awareness of the importance of science                      
              and mathematics education.  Professional development and                       
              support will provide the basis for improved science                            
              instruction in the elementary grades and mathematics                           
              instruction in the middle grades.
