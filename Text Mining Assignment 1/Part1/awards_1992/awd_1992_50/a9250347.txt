Abstract    :
              The Department of Chemistry is acquiring a 300-MHz Fourier-                    
              transform nuclear magnetic resonance spectrometer capable of                   
              rapid determination of 1H and 13C NMR spectra in an                            
              undergraduate setting.  This instrument is allowing the                        
              exploration of most of the new NMR techniques, such as APT,                    
              DEPT, COSY, NOE and HETCOR, now used to determine molecular                    
              parameters.  The availability of a variable temperature module                 
              is allowing dynamic properties of molecules to be studied.  The                
              equipment is being used extensively in seven undergraduate                     
              courses in organic, inorganic, physical, and biochemistry and                  
              in faculty-supervised undergraduate research projects during                   
              the academic year and summer to achieve significant improvement                
              and development of the undergraduate course sequence.  In                      
              addition, faculty at area high schools are gaining hands-on                    
              experience on the instrument, and faculty and students at two                  
              neighboring colleges are using the instrument.
