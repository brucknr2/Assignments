Abstract    :
              The aim of this project is to broaden and strengthen the                       
              training of students in modern light and electron microscopic                  
              approaches in biology.  The requested equipment will expand the                
              range of techniques introduced and used in laboratory exercises                
              and independent research in our Electron Microscopy course, and                
              increase the available research approaches and sophistication                  
              of independent student research projects.  The equipment will                  
              also allow the expansion of instruction in modern cell biology                 
              in other advanced courses in our curriculum as well as in                      
              introductory biology courses.  Project participation will                      
              result in better education of our upper level students through                 
              collaborative student/faculty research and, an increase in the                 
              enthusiasm of our introductory biology students for science
