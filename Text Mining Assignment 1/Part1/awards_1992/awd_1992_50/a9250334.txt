Abstract    :
              A laboratory is being developed to enable large numbers of                     
              students to make use of The Calculus Companion, which is a                     
              computerized system allowing the symbolic algebra Maple to be                  
              accessible to first-year calculus students.  This interface                    
              makes complex computations available by the use of pull-down                   
              menus in the spirit of Macintosh.  Classroom laboratories have                 
              been developed which integrate the system into the curriculum.                 
              These laboratories lead the student step-by-step through the                   
              solution of a problem.  Many of them reflect a reform in                       
              calculus by presenting interesting and challenging problems.                   
              Others follow along the syllabus of a more standard calculus                   
              curriculum.  Both utilize the Calculus Companion's advanced                    
              features.
