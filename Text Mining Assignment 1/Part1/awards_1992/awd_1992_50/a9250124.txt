Abstract    :
              A human-computer interaction laboratory at the Psychology                      
              Department of the University of Illinois at Urbana is being                    
              enhanced for students from the fields of Industrial                            
              Engineering, Human Factors, and Cognitive Science.  The new                    
              laboratory experiments provide a detailed account of human                     
              capabilities and limitations affecting interface design in                     
              general, but giving particular emphasis as it relates to                       
              computer products.  The state-of-the-art interdisciplinary                     
              laboratory is oriented to the design and evaluation of human-                  
              computer interfaces.  Students from Computer Science,                          
              Psychology, and Industrial Engineering are learning the basic                  
              concepts, methodology, and skills necessary to evaluate and                    
              design human-computer interfaces.  The multi-disciplinary                      
              perspectives that are necessary for the successful design of                   
              computer products are fostered as part of the educational                      
              process when students from these different disciplines are                     
              brought together.
