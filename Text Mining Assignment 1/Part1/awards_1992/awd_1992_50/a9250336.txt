Abstract    :
              The goal of the project is to increase the quality of                          
              undergraduate laboratory education in psychology at                            
              Metropolitan State College of Denver (MSCD) and to provide                     
              increased student experience with current computer technology.                 
              The Psychology Department has established a strong statistics                  
              and methodological requirement in its curriculum.  Students'                   
              exposure to experimentation is currently limited to the two-                   
              semester required research methods course sequence.  The                       
              department is committed to providing direct experimental                       
              experience in a developmentally sound sequence, beginning with                 
              demonstrations using single subjects in Introductory Psychology                
              and progressing through research design, data collection, and                  
              analysis in such content courses as Sensation and Perception,                  
              Cognitive Psychology, and the Psychology of Learning.  The                     
              hands-on research activities and demonstrations will broaden                   
              student contact with basic principles and concepts of                          
              scientific methodology and increase their technological and                    
              experimental skills.
