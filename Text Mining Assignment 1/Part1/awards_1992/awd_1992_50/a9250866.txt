Abstract    :
              This project involves a novel remotely controlled telescope                    
              used for undergraduate astronomical laboratories.  The                         
              telescope is at an existing University-owned Observatory with                  
              very low light pollution and excellent observing conditions.                   
              The telescope and camera system are operated via a telephone                   
              link to the student laboratory on campus.  This relatively low                 
              cost system allows students direct access to a powerful, highly                
              functional instrument which is capable of demonstrating many                   
              astronomical objects studied in the lecture and textbook but                   
              which would be difficult or impossible to observe with                         
              telescopes located on campus.  Both hardware and software is                   
              designed to be completely hands-on and user-friendly so that                   
              average students can design and run their own observations with                
              minimum assistance.  After an initial period of use at the                     
              University of Iowa, use of this instrument will be extended to                 
              other regional colleges who would jointly operate the telescope                
              on a shared basis.
