Abstract    :
              This project is designed to improve two two-semester                           
              introductory biology courses, one for non-science majors and                   
              one for science majors.  Specifically, the project focuses on                  
              the revision of the laboratory sections of the courses from one                
              of a series of cookbook exercises to one that is project                       
              oriented focusing on scientific methodology, data acquisition,                 
              collection, organization and analysis, instrumentation,                        
              biotechnology, mathematics and report writing. Research teams                  
              consisting of two students will spend an entire semester                       
              exploring a self-selected research problem. It is thought that                 
              the project will better present science as it is actually                      
              practiced, will develop scientific reasoning skills among our                  
              students and will enhance scientific literacy.
