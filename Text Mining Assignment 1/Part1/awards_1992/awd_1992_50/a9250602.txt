Abstract    :
              A Mathematics Resource Center is being developed; it plays a                   
              significant role in the development of the mathematics major,                  
              increases the visibility of mathematics on campus, and serves                  
              as a meeting place for individual and group study by math                      
              majors.Undergraduate research and capstone experiences have                    
              been identified by the mathematics, education, and industrial                  
              communities as a valuable component in undergraduate                           
              mathematics education.  Accordingly, a senior Research Project                 
              is now being required for all students majoring in mathematics.                
              The resource center is serving a major role in the development                 
              of these research experiences.
