Abstract    :
              The aim of this project is to provide students the opportunity                 
              to practice science as an investigative process.  Molecular                    
              biology related equipment (microfuge, UV/VIS spectrophotometer,                
              UV photographic work station, repipets and electrophoresis                     
              equipment) will be purchased to facilitate addition of a                       
              laboratory component to the biology majors one-semester                        
              introductory genetics class.  A pilot study has been done with                 
              a class of 14 students.  The class will impact about 120                       
              students/year; approximately 8% minority.  The laboratory will                 
              include six experiments each emphasizing an inquiry based                      
              teaching mode involving the students in decision making                        
              processes, emphasizing understanding of techniques and analysis                
              of results.  The experiments are:  (1) expression of the ci                    
              locus in Drosophila melanogaster; (2) isolation and physical                   
              properties of eucaryotic DNA; (3) transformation of antibiotic                 
              resistance in E. coli; (4) restriction enzymes and DNA mapping;                
              (5) making a recombinant DNA molecule; and (6) pedigree and                    
              gene frequency.
