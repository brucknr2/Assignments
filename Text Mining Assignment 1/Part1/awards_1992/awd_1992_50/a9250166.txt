Abstract    :
              A scientific computing facility for students majoring in                       
              mathematics, physics and chemistry is being developed.  The                    
              facility  provides a computing environment sufficiently                        
              powerful and versatile to be useful in many technical courses                  
              without being tied to any one course.  Prospective majors are                  
              being taught the required computational skills during their                    
              sophomore year, using examples taken from concurrent course                    
              work.  Following the introductory course, all instructors are                  
              able to assume that every student can access and use a range of                
              computational tools. This common background facilitates                        
              appropriate use of computers in the three disciplines.
