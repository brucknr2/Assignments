Abstract    :
              The project is to update and substantially upgrade the gamma                   
              ray spectroscopy component of the nuclear physics laboratory                   
              program for physics/applied physics majors and physics                         
              concentration education majors at Xavier.  By acquiring a high                 
              purity, high-resolution germanium (HPGe) detector and by                       
              assembling modern computer based multichannel analyzer systems,                
              significant improvements in gamma ray spectroscopy experiments                 
              will be achieved.  Two such systems are proposed, one for                      
              germanium and one for sodium iodide.  Each system are comprised                
              of state-of-the-art hardware and software.  Each system makes                  
              significant and appropriate use of two recently acquired IBM                   
              PS/2 Model 80 computers in the nuclear laboratory.  Student                    
              experiments and research projects are enhanced and improved by                 
              the increased resolution of the HPGe detector and by the                       
              powerful analysis and library features of the software.                        
              Instruction in the principles of photon detection, gamma ray                   
              physics, and nuclear physics is being enhanced and increased                   
              and training in modern computer-based nuclear data acquisition                 
              and analysis techniques is being provided.  Such training is                   
              important for undergraduates who will later work in high                       
              technology industries or graduate research laboratories.  The                  
              spectroscopy systems also provide opportunities for more                       
              meaningful undergraduate student research projects.
