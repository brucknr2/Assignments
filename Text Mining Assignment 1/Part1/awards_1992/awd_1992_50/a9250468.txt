Abstract    :
              The Departments of Chemistry and Biology are purchasing a                      
              Fourier Transform infrared spectrometer (FTIR) for use in                      
              chemically oriented instruction in both departments.  Students                 
              learn the use of computer controlled FTIR spectrophotometry for                
              the elucidation of organic structures as well as data                          
              manipulation and analysis.  The high sensitivity and analysis                  
              speed of the FTIR allow use for a greater variety of                           
              experiments than was possible with prior instruments.  The                     
              computer search capabilities provide students with an                          
              understanding of the identification process inherent in                        
              infrared analysis and demonstrate the usefulness of computer                   
              database interfacing to instruments.  In the organic chemistry                 
              laboratory, students use the instrument to identify the key                    
              chemical compounds involved in the multi-step synthesis of                     
              lidocaine from 2,6-dimethylnitrobenzene.  In the instrumental                  
              analysis course, students study both the theoretical and                       
              practical aspects of FTIR.  In the physical chemistry course,                  
              an experiment is performed to study the rotational fine                        
              structure of the infrared vibrational spectra of hydrogen                      
              chloride and deuterium chloride.  In addition, a general                       
              education course in introductory chemistry for non-majors                      
              provides students with experiences in FTIR analysis involving                  
              such procedures as the purification of aspirin.
