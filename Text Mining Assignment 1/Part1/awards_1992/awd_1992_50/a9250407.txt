Abstract    :
              This project will provide laboratory equipment necessary to add                
              a set of fiber optic application exercises to an existing                      
              junior-level elective in Optics and Electro-Optical Devices.                   
              Components being acquired include lasers, positioners,                         
              detectors, fiber couplers, and assorted other laboratory items.                
              The exercises will illustrate concepts currently covered in the                
              course for which the current laboratory equipment is inadequate                
              to provide laboratory experience.
