Abstract    :
              The Department of Chemistry is purchasing a Fourier transform                  
              raman spectrometer  for use several upper level courses and in                 
              undergraduate research.  Among the experiments being performed                 
              by upperclassmen are comparision of Raman and infrared spectra                 
              for symmetrical and unsymmetrical halogenated hydrocarbons,                    
              study of a variety of transition metal carbonyls, and the role                 
              of individual amino acids in the function and structure of                     
              proteins.  A new polymer course is being developed to take                     
              advantage of the availability of Raman spectroscopy.  The                      
              undergraduate research program is also benefiting from the new                 
              instrumentation.
