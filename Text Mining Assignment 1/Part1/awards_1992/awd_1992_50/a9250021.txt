Abstract    :
              This Minority Research Initiation Planning activity will focus                 
              on the structure elucidation of different anthocyanins found in                
              fruits.  Structures will be compared and the quantities present                
              will be determined. Target species in which to investigate                     
              anthocyanin production, structure and quantity include Vitus                   
              (grape) and Vacinium (cranberry.)  The fruits of both species                  
              produce high yields of extracted anthocyanins, and both can be                 
              adapted to uniform and consistent in vitro culture for                         
              controlled production of pigments.  The results will provide                   
              basic information about the chemistry of anthocyanins and                      
              related flavinoids on which to focus future research.

              The structures obtained in this research will help in the                      
              understanding of production of color in plant tissue, and will                 
              contribute significantly to our knowledge of one common class                  
              of plant pigments.
