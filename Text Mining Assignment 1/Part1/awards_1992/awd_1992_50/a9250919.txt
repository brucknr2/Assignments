Abstract    :
              A formal real-time signal processing laboratory is being                       
              developed.  Laboratory facilities will include DSP development                 
              systems, PCs, data acquisition systems, and spectrum analyzers.                
              Laboratory facilities will be utilized primarily by students in                
              four undergraduate courses:   digital signal processing,                       
              biomedical signal processing, speech processing, and senior                    
              design honors work.  Students are provided with a guided design                
              experience and are exposed to practical signal processing                      
              problems and important technologies for implementing real-time                 
              digital signal processing systems.
