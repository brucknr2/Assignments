Abstract    :
              The Department of Technology and Physical Science is purchasing                
              a gas chromatograph and a Fourier transform infrared                           
              spectrophotometer for use in organic chemistry.  Students are                  
              using the instruments to study reaction mechanisms, establish                  
              the identity and amounts of the intermediates and products                     
              obtained from reactions, investigate reaction rates.
