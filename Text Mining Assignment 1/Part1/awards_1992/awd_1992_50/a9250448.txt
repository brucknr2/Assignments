Abstract    :
              The second-year mathematics sequence is being changed to                       
              incorporate the use of computers into advanced calculus and                    
              geometry. A laboratory of NeXT workstations is being set up for                
              use in teaching and developing both courses.  The advanced                     
              calculus component is a joint project between Washington and                   
              Lee University and the University of Michigan and is currently                 
              in its second year.  The geometry component is a joint project                 
              between the PI and Professor William Goldman of the University                 
              of Maryland and is being developed as part of the Utah Regional                
              Geometry Institute. Dissemination of the materials developed                   
              under this project will be via the Summer Geometry Institute in                
              Park City, Utah, by distribution to the member institutions of                 
              the RGI and by publication of the advanced calculus materials.
