Abstract    :
              Undergraduate students in the Electronics Engineering                          
              Technology program at St. Petersburg Junior College have now                   
              the opportunity of being active learners in three required                     
              laboratory courses.  Newly acquired digital storage                            
              oscilloscopes and logic analyzers enable the students to                       
              perform a series of hands-on experiments to master the                         
              principles and practices associated with use of modern                         
              equipment to increase the accuracy and resolution in electronic                
              measurements.  Three required laboratory courses in digital                    
              circuits, electronic instrumentation, and automatic control,                   
              are being revised to accommodate the new equipment and learning                
              opportunities.  Additionally, a state-of-the-art laboratory                    
              course devoted to Advanced Electronic Instrumentation is being                 
              developed and utilizes the new equipment.  The laboratory                      
              experiments conducted in these laboratories help students                      
              increase their problem-solving skills related to advanced                      
              measurement techniques necessary for accuracy, resolution, and                 
              storage for the analog-to-digital conversion circuits and                      
              microprocessor-based technology.
