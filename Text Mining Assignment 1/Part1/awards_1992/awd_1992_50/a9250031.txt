Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The Secondary Science Teacher Education Program (Second STEP)                  
              at Miami University will address the preparation of teachers                   
              who are competent and willing to teach in diverse cultural and                 
              ethnic settings, assess the effectiveness of individual                        
              accumulative program activities on teaching behavior, and                      
              compare the effectiveness of an innovative program with that                   
              of two traditional teacher education programs.  The Second                     
              STEP project will develop new undergraduate science content                    
              courses and revise education courses to include integrated                     
              field experiences for prospective science teachers.  The                       
              program will be based on emerging research on science teaching                 
              and learning and cultivate an established liaison with a                       
              predominantly minority school system.  The Program will foster                 
              the integration of content expertise, content-specific                         
              pedagogy and teaching practice.  A major focus will be to                      
              establish opportunities for prospective teachers to gain early                 
              and practical experiences with diverse (racial, ethnic, or                     
              cultural) learners.  Although the Second STEP Program will                     
              directly address undergraduate science teacher education, its                  
              activities are also designed to impact the professional                        
              development of both science and education faculty at Miami                     
              University as well as teachers of a major urban school                         
              district.
