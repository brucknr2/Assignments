Abstract    :
              The Department of Chemistry is purchasing an instrument package                
              including a high performance liquid chromatograph equipped with                
              a diode array spectrophotometric detector, data station and                    
              printer.  This HPLC is to be integrated into analytical and                    
              synthetic laboratory courses.  Applications of this fundamental                
              capability are to be extended into virtually every field of                    
              inquiry in the curriculum where quantitative measurements are                  
              required.  New instructional materials and laboratory                          
              experiments are to be developed to facilitate student                          
              understanding of this technology.  Applications of HPLC                        
              suitable to a local high school teacher's workshop also are to                 
              be implemented.
