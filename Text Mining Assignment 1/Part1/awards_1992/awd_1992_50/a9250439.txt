Abstract    :
              The Division of Science and Mathematics is acquiring equipment                 
              for use by undergraduates in the study of sedimentary                          
              processes, Quaternary deposits, the fundamentals of laboratory                 
              analysis, and in an ongoing student research program.  The                     
              instruments are enabling curriculum changes to be made that                    
              promote the understanding of sedimentary processes, and develop                
              fundamental skills of analytical techniques via a three stage                  
              curricular approach: introduction of concepts and skills; skill                
              development, and; application.  Undergraduates engaging in                     
              research are studying the origin and history of glacial                        
              deposits in west central Minnesota using sediment and                          
              provenance analysis.***//
