Abstract    :
              The purpose of this proposal is to introduce microcomputers                    
              into Neumann's biology laboratories and to expand opportunities                
              for independent research on campus.  Presently the students                    
              have little experience using microcomputers to facilitate data                 
              collection and analysis in the laboratory.  Funds are requested                
              to purchase five lab stations each comprised of a microcomputer                
              (Apple Macintosh), an inexpensive analog to digital board                      
              (Universal Lab Interface by Vernier Software), and appropriate                 
              transducers (many of which will be adapted from existing                       
              instrumentation).  Funds are also requested for sound analysis                 
              software/hardware to interface with the same microcomputers.                   
              This equipment will be used to enrich existing laboratory                      
              exercises in physiology, and to develop new laboratory                         
              exercises in human physiology and the animal behavior portion                  
              of ecology.  It will also enable students to participate with                  
              faculty in ongoing research programs in animal communication.
