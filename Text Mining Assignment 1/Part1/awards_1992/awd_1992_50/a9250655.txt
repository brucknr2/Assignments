Abstract    :
              A laboratory combining chemistry and geoscience is being                       
              developed for water chemistry studies.  The project is                         
              supported with new analytical equipment, an inductively coupled                
              plasma atomic emission spectrometer (ICP-AES).  In                             
              interdisciplinary courses, using Seneca Lake as a natural                      
              laboratory, students perform collaborative geoscience-chemistry                
              and environmental studies projects to investigate many of the                  
              lake's chemical components.  Student research projects are also                
              developed using the ICP-AES.
