Abstract    :
              The goal of this project is to acquire a set of hardware and                   
              software that will provide flexibility in supporting CASE                      
              (Computer-aided Software Engineering) tools for project-                       
              oriented courses.  The project will acquire five SUN                           
              workstations with UNIX operating system and X-window protocol                  
              and appropriate CASE software tools.  A laboratory manual for                  
              the selected tools will be developed which will be tutorial in                 
              nature with the purpose of getting the students into the CASE                  
              tool environment as quickly as possible.  One of the biggest                   
              drawbacks with teaching software engineering process without                   
              CASE tools is that it is difficult for the students to see the                 
              benefits of the iteration and control processes in the software                
              development.  This software engineering laboratory setup will                  
              allow emphasis on these processes without undue burden on the                  
              students' part to manually track documents and artifacts.
