Abstract    :
              This project is to create a computer networks laboratory  which                
              will be an integral and essential part of a newly developed                    
              undergraduate computer networks course, aimed at students in                   
              both Computer Science and Electrical Engineering.  The computer                
              networks course will cover both the theoretical and practical                  
              aspects of computer network design, implementation, and                        
              performance.  The laboratory will broaden the experience of                    
              undergraduate students with the actual development and use of                  
              computer networks.  The requirement to interrupt the operation                 
              of the network, and its associated computers, makes it                         
              impractical to use existing computer facilities for the                        
              networks.  In addition to its use by the undergraduate computer                
              networks class, the laboratory will used in the undergraduate                  
              operating systems course and a future distributed systems                      
              course.  Electrical Engineering students can take the computer                 
              networks course as an electrical engineering elective and can                  
              also use the laboratory to work on design projects associated                  
              with computer networks.
