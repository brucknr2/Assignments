Abstract    :
              Cooper Union's Department of Electrical Engineering will                       
              establish an undergraduate Computer Networking Laboratory with                 
              the primary goal of studying multimedia (data/voice/image)                     
              communications, inter-network connectivity, and network                        
              management.  To strengthen the Department's traditional                        
              emphasis on open-ended practical design projects, the facility                 
              will be used primarily as a testbed for implementing and                       
              testing innovative hardware/software design projects in several                
              undergraduate courses. In addition, the laboratory will be used                
              for hands-on demonstrations accompanying class lectures in the                 
              communications courses and others.The plan calls for a PC-based                
              16 Mbps Token-ring local area network (LAN) with voice and                     
              image capabilities, an X.25 node interfacing to the LAN, and                   
              several measurement/test instruments.  Student projects will                   
              emphasize the design and implementation of interfaces, signal                  
              processing, and protocols to support multimedia services on the                
              LAN, interconnection of the LAN to the X.25 node and other                     
              systems, and management/monitoring of the networks.
