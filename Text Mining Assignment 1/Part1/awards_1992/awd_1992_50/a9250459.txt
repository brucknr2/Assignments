Abstract    :
              Montgomery County Community College is revising its Engineering                
              Technology Program in response to a plan developed by merging                  
              ideas and experiences of engineers, educators, and engineering                 
              technicians.  The goal of the improved curriculum is to give                   
              the students a fundamental background in general engineering                   
              theory and applications of this theory to laboratory analysis.                 
              The curriculum emphasizes good laboratory techniques, computer-                
              aided data analysis, and both written and oral communication of                
              laboratory results.  This project provides equipment for the                   
              required laboratory courses.  The laboratory equipment                         
              demonstrates various laboratory procedures that are                            
              specifically designed to reinforce the engineering principles                  
              presented in lecture.  Some of this equipment includes software                
              to aid in data analysis, and the project includes two                          
              computers, one printer, and one plotter to enable the students                 
              to perform computer-aided data analysis.
