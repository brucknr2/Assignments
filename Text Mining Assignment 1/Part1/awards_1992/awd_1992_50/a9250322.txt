Abstract    :
              An undergraduate course in experimental biochemistry is                        
              revitalized by integrating modern biochemical research into an                 
              existing core laboratory curriculum.  The project is designed                  
              around investigation of TBP, a protein transcription factor.                   
              The experiments consist of purifying a cloned fusion protein,                  
              and then testing the protein for transcriptional activity                      
              against wild type and mutant templates by measurement of mRNA                  
              synthesis in vitro, and for DNA-protein interactions in gel                    
              electrophoresis mobility-shift assays using probes generated by                
              the PCR technique.
