Abstract    :
              The purchase of a GC-MS is enabling this hyphenated technique                  
              to be used throughout the curriculum.  The goal of the project                 
              is to make the introductory laboratory more representative of                  
              chemistry as it is actually practiced.  For example, students                  
              in general chemistry use GC-MS in a special project undertaken                 
              during the second semester.  Experiments in upper level courses                
              are designed to provide experience with both qualitative and                   
              quantitative GC-MS as it is applied in the different chemistry                 
              subdisciplines.  The instrument is also enhancing the                          
              undergraduate research program.
