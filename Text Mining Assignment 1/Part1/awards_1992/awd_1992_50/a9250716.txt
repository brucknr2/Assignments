Abstract    :
              The project introduces students to modern Radio Frequency (RF)                 
              and microwave measurement techniques via Computer-Aided Design                 
              (CAD) and laboratory experiments.  An additional feature of the                
              program is an emphasis on Electromagnetic Compatibility (EMC)                  
              and Radio Frequency Interference (RFI) training.  Laboratory                   
              experiments include component and system measurements, EMC and                 
              RFI testing, test procedure design, and Automated Test                         
              Equipment (ATE) operation.  A Hewlett Packard spectrum                         
              analyzer, network analyzer and other test equipment are being                  
              be acquired; all are computer controlled from a Macintosh via                  
              IEEE-488 interface.  The equipment is also available to                        
              individuals or groups of students pursuing a RF/microwave                      
              senior design project.
