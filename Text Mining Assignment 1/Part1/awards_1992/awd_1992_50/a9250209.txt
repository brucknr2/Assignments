Abstract    :
              High performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) will be                          
              introduced as an analytical tool in the chemistry/biochemistry                 
              curriculum.  The instrument request includes a ternary pumping                 
              system, data station, and a photo diode array detector.  The                   
              HPLC will be used to improve the Honors, Organic, Analytical,                  
              and Biochemistry classes, as well as student research and                      
              student projects.  Automated, hyphenated, chromatographic-                     
              spectral instruments, such as the HPLC involved in this                        
              project, provide a cost effective way to introduce students to                 
              modern analysis.  The special features of this project include                 
              development of new laboratory procedures for instructional use,                
              impact spanning many uses in courses and undergraduate                         
              research, and involvement of a large proportion of women in the                
              project.
