Abstract    :
              The purpose of this Instrumentation and Laboratory Improvement                 
              Program proposal is to revitalize and renew physics and                        
              mathematics courses at College of the Ozarks.  The goal of the                 
              proposal is the active participation of their students in                      
              learning physics and mathematics.  The program is carrying out                 
              the following objectives, in order of priority:  1) It is                      
              putting in the hands of the General Physics students                           
              significant new computer-based tools to learn physics and do                   
              physics, specifically, a symbolic algebra system (Mathematica)                 
              on a powerful computer (Macintosh II Ci). These tools are                      
              engaging the students and are requiring the students to                        
              actively participating the learning process.  2) The program is                
              maintaining and improving the numerical computational component                
              of the General Physics Course.  3) It is updating the                          
              microcomputer-based laboratory (MBL) capability to utilize the                 
              Macintosh platform.  4) The project is using Mathematica to                    
              begin a similar revitalization and renewal process of the                      
              Calculus sequence and the upper-division Mathematics courses.                  
              5) The astronomy software--Voyager--is being introduced into                   
              the Physical Science and Astronomy laboratories.  6) The                       
              project is creating a Scientific Computing Facility for all of                 
              the natural sciences and mathematics at College of the Ozarks.
