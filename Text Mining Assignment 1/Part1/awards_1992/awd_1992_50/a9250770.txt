Abstract    :
              This project will provide a computer laboratory facility to:                   
              1) improve instruction in Computer Graphics, Assembly Language                 
              and Machine Architecture, Advanced Programming Techniques, and                 
              C Programming courses;  and 2) provide an environment for                      
              experimentation and innovation in software development                         
              internships/projects involving multimedia storage and                          
              presentation techniques.  The equipment provided includes 80386                
              CPU color graphics workstations and 80486 CPU multimedia                       
              development and presentation workstations.  Multimedia                         
              capabilities will include laserdisc, VCR, scanner, and TV tuner                
              input.  All workstations will be networked via an existing                     
              campus ethernet.  The improved facility will enable improved                   
              instruction in interactive graphics windows and animation,                     
              multimedia interfacing, and database storage and retrieval of                  
              multimedia-based information.  Internship software development                 
              projects will provide a customized software library for                        
              technology instruction.  The project will be modeled for other                 
              two-year college programs through the Research Council of the                  
              SUNY Colleges of Technology.
