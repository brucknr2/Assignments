Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  This three-year project centers around the development of                 
              interactive videodisc case materials for use in the                            
              preparation of preservice elementary teachers.  The Purdue                     
              University program will link with the Pennsylvania State                       
              University to develop, field test, and evaluate these                          
              videodisc.  The intent of these materials is foster and                        
              develop the teaching of elementary science for conceptual                      
              change.  The project will implement these videodisc case                       
              materials in elementary methods classes at universities.  An                   
              extensive evaluation and research plan is in place to assess                   
              the effectiveness of these materials and their use.  Over 450                  
              students (preservice) will be affected by the project.
