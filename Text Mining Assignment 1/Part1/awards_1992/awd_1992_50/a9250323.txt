Abstract    :
              For over 20 years College of the Mainland has been supportive                  
              of experimentation and innovation in the physics laboratory,                   
              leading to a wide variety of experiences for students in eight                 
              physics course offerings ranging from strictly conceptual-based                
              courses to calculus-based modern physics, rather than the                      
              traditional set of experiments.  All courses may be taken in a                 
              traditional or individualized, self-paced mode.  The laboratory                
              is open throughout the day and at least two evenings per week;                 
              laboratory work is worth 50% of the student grade.For over 30                  
              years the PI has developed, modified, utilized, built, bought                  
              and tried out software and hardware from a variety of sources.                 
              There are now over a 1,000 experiments that students may select                
              to meet their laboratory requirement.  This has resulted in a                  
              tremendous bookkeeping and inventory problem because resources                 
              are utilized from several areas on campus that do not always                   
              meet the specific demands of the particular experiment.Support                 
              has been obtained for updated, uniform, particular hardware and                
              software that is being maintained in the Physics Learning                      
              Center and thus is being made available to more students in an                 
              immediate teaching environment.  The essential equipment                       
              consists of eight microcomputers, two laser printers, four CD-                 
              ROM drives, four Labview 2s, four Universal Lab Interfaces, and                
              associated sensors and probes.
