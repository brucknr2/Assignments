Abstract    :
              The equipment is completing a modernization of the two-quarter                 
              Electronic Design class offered by the Physics Department.  A                  
              third one-quarter class in computer interfacing is being                       
              developed.  It will involve students in using personal                         
              computers to control temperature, and to measure the                           
              temperature dependent optical transmission of a simple Fabry-                  
              Perot etalon.  They are using a real-time multitasking UNIX-                   
              like operating system, the C programming language, analog to                   
              digital and digital to analog converters, and rudiments of                     
              feedback control theory.
