Abstract    :
              The chemical applications of lasers is being introduced                        
              throughout the chemistry curriculum.  Laser experiments using                  
              modern chemical instrumentation are replacing traditional wet                  
              chemical procedures in the first-year General/Analytical                       
              Chemistry sequence.  Chiral product characterization using                     
              laser polarimetry following microscale synthesis is being                      
              introduced in organic and inorganic Chemistry laboratories.  In                
              the analytical and physical laboratories lasers are used to                    
              probe excited states, to study chemical events taking place on                 
              the nanosecond timescale, and to investigate nonlinear                         
              spectroscopy via two-laser multiphoton excitation, Raman                       
              scattering, and harmonic generation experiments.
