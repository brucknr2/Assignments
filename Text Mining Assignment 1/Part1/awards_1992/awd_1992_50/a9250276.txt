Abstract    :
              The Chemistry Department is purchasing a 60 MHz NMR                            
              Spectrometer for use in the organic chemistry laboratory                       
              course, and in a variety of upper-division laboratory courses.                 
              In sophomore organic chemistry, students use the instrument to                 
              analyze a variety of products of chemical synthesis.  In the                   
              junior organic course, the NMR is used to demonstrate aromatic                 
              ring currents as part of a synthesis of tin-prophorin                          
              complexes.  The instrument is also used in connection with the                 
              senior level instrumental analysis course, the inorganic and                   
              biochemistry laboratories, and the senior research program.                    
              The fourier transform capability of the instrument is of                       
              particular importance to the Department since it provides                      
              students with valuable experience in the techniques of FT-NMR                  
              spectroscopy, as well as the opportunity to demonstrate the                    
              interdisciplinary importance of mathematics in the sciences.
