Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The Partnership for Reform Initiatives in Science and                          
              Mathematics (PRISM), between the Department of Education and                   
              the Kentucky Science and Technology Council, Inc., builds                      
              upon the Kentucky Education Reform Act (KERA) to address                       
              specific needs and barriers hindering the restructuring of                     
              science and mathematics education in the State.  The project                   
              has three goals.                                                               
                                                                                             
              1.   Kentucky students will acquire the conceptual                             
                   knowledge, process skills, thinking skills, and habits                    
                   of mind that characterize scientific literacy.                            
                                                                                             
              2.   More Kentucky students, especially those from                             
                   underrepresented groups, will follow programs leading                     
                   to science, mathematics, and technology-related                           
                   careers, including teaching.                                              
                                                                                             
              3.   The general public and opinion leaders in Kentucky will                   
                   value knowledge and skills in mathematics, science, and                   
                   technology as important outcomes of education.                            
                                                                                             
              To achieve these goals, PRISM will coordinate mathematics                      
              and science initiatives in four areas:  develop teacher-                       
              specialists to support change in classroom practices; alter                    
              teacher preservice programs; develop and implement a plan to                   
              foster participation by underrepresented groups; and                           
              establish policy to enhance awareness and value of                             
              mathematics and science education.
