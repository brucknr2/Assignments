Abstract    :
              The traditional calculus course has been broadly criticized for                
              emphasizing algorithmic computations and techniques at the                     
              expense of conceptual understanding, for an absence of                         
              realistic problems, and for decreasing student interest in                     
              mathematics.  To actively engage students in doing mathematics                 
              and using modern computational tools, a calculus sequence with                 
              an integrated laboratory component is being developed.  The                    
              laboratory uses existing mathematical software tools (Derive)                  
              and MS-DOS systems.  Such software is sufficiently powerful,                   
              easy to use, and affordable.  Use of these mathematical tools                  
              in the precalculus and calculus sections is increasing interest                
              and improving student performance.
