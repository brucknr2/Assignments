Abstract    :
              A one year introductory biochemistry laboratory class is                       
              equipped with a refrigerated high speed centrifuge in order to                 
              investigate the biochemical parameters of brown adipose tissue.                
              The students explore a variety of techniques.  The class                       
              encourages small group investigations of various components of                 
              a problem followed by class comparison and discussion of the                   
              data.
