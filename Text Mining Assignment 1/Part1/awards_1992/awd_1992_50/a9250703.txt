Abstract    :
              The Department of Geology and Astronomy is purchasing sample                   
              preparation equipment required for X-ray fluorescence and X-ray                
              diffraction, used in conjunction with existing X-ray analysis                  
              instruments.  Students in upper level required courses use the                 
              analytic equipment in geologic investigations.  Students from                  
              a variety of science disciplines at the University enroll in a                 
              course providing general instruction in X-ray analysis.  In                    
              addition, the equipment is shared with other departments within                
              the University which are engaged in undergraduate research.
