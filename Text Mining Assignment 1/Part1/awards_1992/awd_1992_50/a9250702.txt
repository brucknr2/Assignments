Abstract    :
              A small astronomical observatory built around a commercially                   
              available telescope and photometer is being used by                            
              undergraduate students.  The observatory is located on campus                  
              to provide maximum access for students.  It is intended for use                
              in elementary courses and to support senior and honors thesis                  
              projects.  Projects deal largely with photometry, particularly                 
              of variable stars.  The University of Puget Sound currently                    
              offers three courses in astronomy, and sends some students to                  
              graduate programs in astronomy and astrophysics.
