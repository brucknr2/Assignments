Abstract    :
              Power engineering students in the Electrical Engineering                       
              Department at the University of Wyoming are using a graphics-                  
              oriented software tool for education, research, and training in                
              a new 486-based personal computer laboratory.  The tool called                 
              COPERITE has all user interfaces, menus and windows, resident                  
              on the computers in the laboratory.  The application programs                  
              are executed on a faster DEC 3100 workstation networked with                   
              the PCs through an ethernet transparent to the users of the                    
              graphical front-end.  Students using this laboratory learn                     
              about power flow, power flow control, contingency analysis,                    
              economic dispatch, security-constrained dispatch, stability                    
              analysis, fault analysis, and electromagnetic transients                       
              analysis.  The new facility: 1) allows learning network                        
              modeling through per unit representation on one-line diagrams;                 
              (2) provides a framework for studying the behavior of sample                   
              networks under steady state and transient conditions; (3)                      
              allows for control of a power system network for                               
              economy/security conditions; and (4) provides a means for                      
              applications of artificial intelligence to improve power system                
              operations.
