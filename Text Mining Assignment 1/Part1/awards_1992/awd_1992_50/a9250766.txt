Abstract    :
              The Department of Chemistry is developing a series of                          
              laboratories for introductory chemistry that:  (1) uses modern                 
              technology to engage the students; (2) provides students with                  
              opportunities to design experiments that explore topics of                     
              current chemical interest; and (3) allows students to discover                 
              or develop appropriate ways to analyze their data.  These                      
              laboratory experiments designed for the SCI Technologies                       
              interface board developed at Montana State University span a                   
              range of subjects including atomic and molecular structure,                    
              macroscopic properties of compounds and materials, energetics,                 
              and dynamics and vary from basic ones to those with a high                     
              degree of sophistication.  The experiments are being compiled                  
              into a laboratory manual so that they may be readily adopted by                
              a variety of other educational institutions.
