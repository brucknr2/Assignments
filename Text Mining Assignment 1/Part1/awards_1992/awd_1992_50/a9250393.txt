Abstract    :
              This project will add a second semester laboratory to the                      
              physical chemistry sequence by making use of an FTIR                           
              spectrometer and a differential scanning calorimeter.  The                     
              course will focus on spectroscopy and physical polymer                         
              chemistry experiments.  An expanded instrumental analysis                      
              course will also make use of the FTIR.  The new instruments                    
              will also make possible the restoration of a Polymer Chemistry                 
              course to the chemistry elective offerings.  Besides                           
              significantly upgrading the instrumentation capabilities of the                
              University, the new instruments will allow the Department to                   
              upgrade its curriculum to meet ACS prescribed standards.  They                 
              will also give students hands-on experience with mainstay                      
              equipment in the field of chemistry in general, and in physical                
              and polymer chemistry in particular.
