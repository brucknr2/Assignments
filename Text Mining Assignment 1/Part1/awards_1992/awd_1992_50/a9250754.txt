Abstract    :
              Students of mathematics, science, and engineering, working in                  
              pairs, are enhancing their learning of calculus, differential                  
              equations, and linear algebra using Mathematica in an                          
              instructional laboratory of networked MacIntosh computers.  The                
              goals are: to elucidate selected important concepts by engaging                
              students in carefully designed experiments; to produce                         
              intelligent problem-solvers who appreciate the value of                        
              preliminary analysis of problems for the purpose of devising                   
              strategy, who have a sense of when to use computers and when                   
              not to, and who understand the importance of interpreting and                  
              reflecting upon computer output; to teach students to compare                  
              pictorial with analytic and computational ways of viewing a                    
              problem; and to allow students to take responsibility for the                  
              correctness of their own work by cross-checking theoretical                    
              considerations, common sense, pencil-and-paper computation,                    
              machine computation, and graphics.
