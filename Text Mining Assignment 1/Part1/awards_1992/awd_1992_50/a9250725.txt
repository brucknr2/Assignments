Abstract    :
              An Astronomy lab course for juniors and seniors is being                       
              offered.  It will be a hands-on course in optical and infrared                 
              astronomy instrumentation.  The emphasis is on the hardware                    
              used in contemporary astronomical observations, rather than                    
              software, and the lab will explore the operation of real                       
              detectors and optics, rather than just the principles.  The lab                
              is intended to prepare students to design and build                            
              spectrographs; detector systems, controllers, and cameras by                   
              doing real projects.
