Abstract    :
              The Department of Chemistry is purchasing a 60 MHz Fourier                     
              transform nmr for use throughout the chemistry program.                        
              Students in Organic Chemistry are using the instrument to                      
              characterize the products of synthetic reactions and to confirm                
              orientation rules.  Introduced to advanced techniques such as                  
              the use of chiral shift reagents and spin decoupling techniques                
              are being undertaken in a upper level Organic Chemistry                        
              laboratory.  Physical Chemistry students are studying line                     
              broadening by paramagnetic species and the kinetics of chemical                
              reactions with the instrument.
