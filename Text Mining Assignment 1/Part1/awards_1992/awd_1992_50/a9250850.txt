Abstract    :
              Seniors in electrical engineering and microelectronics courses                 
              at San Jose State University are using Field Programmable Gate                 
              Array (FPGA) development systems as a design tool in their                     
              digital systems laboratory experience.  New laboratory modules                 
              are used in teaching computer organization and digital system                  
              interfacing courses.  The FPGA laboratory facilities also                      
              support senior student projects, providing a more interesting                  
              learning and teaching environment by enabling rapid prototyping                
              and concurrent engineering.
