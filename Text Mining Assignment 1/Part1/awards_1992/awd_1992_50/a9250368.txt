Abstract    :
              The project design includes plans to upgrade the undergraduate                 
              experimental psychology laboratory at Bloomsburg University.                   
              The specific goals are to increase the variety, flexibility,                   
              and complexity of experiments performed in laboratory courses,                 
              allow for demonstrations in courses without labs including                     
              learning, cognitive, physiological, and behavior modification,                 
              and increase the number of students participating in                           
              independent research projects.  The plan is to 1) interface a                  
              series of operant-conditioning chambers for rats with an IBM-                  
              compatible computer and examine a wide range of variables that                 
              affect learned behavior, 2) use six IBM-compatible computers,                  
              hardware, and software to conduct experiments in areas of human                
              perception, cognition, and social behavior, and 3) use                         
              recording equipment to measure physiological responses such as                 
              heart rate, blood pressure, brain waves, skin resistance,                      
              muscle tension, blood flow, and limb movement in order to                      
              examine physiology-environment interactions.  With this                        
              equipment students will design and conduct high-quality animal                 
              and human experiments that demonstrate a wide range of                         
              psychological phenomena.
