Abstract    :
              A course and text are being developed for upper level                          
              undergraduates who are interested in the use of sophisticated                  
              mathematics to solve problems arising in industry.  The goal of                
              the course is to demonstrate the usefulness of mathematics in                  
              contemporary industrial problems, with students modeling and                   
              solving real-life problems. The mathematics foundation will be                 
              the theory of ordinary and partial differential equations.                     
              Particular attention will be given to the formulation of open                  
              ended questions arising in the industrial problems.                            
              Computational and analytical approaches will both be important                 
              in the mathematical analysis necessary to address physically                   
              motivated issues.
