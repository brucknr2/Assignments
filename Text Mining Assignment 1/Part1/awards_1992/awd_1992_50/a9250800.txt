Abstract    :
              The project will establish a laboratory-based, discovery-                      
              curriculum in Learning and Behavior, an intermediate-level                     
              course commonly offered within undergraduate psychology                        
              curricula.  The intent is not simply to introduce laboratory                   
              work as a component of the course; rather, it is to reverse the                
              usual relationship between lecture and laboratory work so that                 
              laboratory investigation becomes the primary route through                     
              which students come into contact with the discipline.  This                    
              course may then serve as a model through which other standard                  
              psychology courses may be reorganized within a discovery                       
              curriculum framework.   The requested equipment will permit the                
              rapid changeover between experimental configurations, and will                 
              allow students with minimal pretraining to program a wide                      
              variety of animal conditioning procedures.
