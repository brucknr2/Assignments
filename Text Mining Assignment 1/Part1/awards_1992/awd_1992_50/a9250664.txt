Abstract    :
              The addition of fully automated scanning electron microscopy to                
              the undergraduate  biology laboratories at North Hennepin                      
              Community College (NHCC) will make possible a level of science                 
              instruction at the lower-division that was, before this time,                  
              reserved only for upper-division and graduate students. Using                  
              an older, manually operated Scanning Electron Microscope(SEM),                 
              a pilot project with SEM applications for lower-division                       
              college students has demonstrated that SEM lab experiences                     
              generate a greater interest in and understanding of science                    
              subjects.  A fully automated, user friendly SEM will permit the                
              following changes to be made in the Biology Department:  (1) A                 
              new course focusing on techniques in structual biology that                    
              includes a student research componen will be added; (2)                        
              students studying cell and molecular biology will have enhanced                
              hands-on lab experience in the examination of cellular and                     
              tissue structure; (3) all students in introductory biology will                
              have an opportunity for firsthand operation of a SEM -The                      
              experience itself and the micrographs produced will supplement                 
              other laboratory and lecture materials used for the study of                   
              intricate structures; and (4) laboratory demonstrations for                    
              visiting secondary school students and opportunities for                       
              research projects by visiting college and secondary school                     
              educators will increase.
