Abstract    :
              A new laboratory provides juniors and seniors in Electrical                    
              Engineering facilities for project design: modeling,                           
              prototyping, and testing in an environment similar to that of                  
              an industrial research laboratory.  Students have the resources                
              to complete significant projects and also become more familiar                 
              with the environment they will encounter upon starting careers.                
              The laboratory includes:  (1) student workbenches to provide                   
              immediate access to continuously needed equipment (a networked                 
              PC, power supply, multimeter, oscilloscope, and circuit board                  
              assembly tools); (2) mini-laboratories containing equipment                    
              (printer, logic analyzer, counter, function generator, pulse                   
              generator, and logic troubleshooting kit) often but not                        
              continually needed by each student; and (3) computing resources                
              served by a 486 PC networked to laboratory workbenches and the                 
              university computer system.  The laboratory equipment is                       
              supplemented by a resource center including a component                        
              warehouse, a design library, and an equipment pool.
