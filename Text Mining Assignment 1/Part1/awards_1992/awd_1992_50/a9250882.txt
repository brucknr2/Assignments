Abstract    :
              A computer component is being added to all first-year calculus                 
              classes, integrating a lecture approach with an interactive                    
              computer laboratory component centered around Mathematica                      
              notebooks on NeXT computers.. The Department is currently                      
              implementing an NSF calculus grant - acting as a test site for                 
              materials developed at the University of Iowa. In addition, the                
              Department of Physics is integrating Mathematica-based                         
              assignments into all first-year calculus-based courses and some                
              higher-level classes.  The students' experience in calculus                    
              makes this transition possible and effective. The project                      
              directors are working closely with a number of other                           
              universities which are currently experimenting with similar                    
              models, including the University of Iowa and the University of                 
              Wisconsin at LaCrosse. The materials and experiences are being                 
              disseminated through the Rocky Mountain Calculus Project - a                   
              consortium of Colorado and Wyoming colleges that fosters                       
              Calculus Reform, as well as other forums.
