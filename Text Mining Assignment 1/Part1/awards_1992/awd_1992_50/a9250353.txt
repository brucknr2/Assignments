Abstract    :
              This Department of Physics is purchasing equipment for weather                 
              monitoring and forecasting to support a course in Introductory                 
              Meteorology which is taken by non-science majors to meet                       
              graduation requirements.  The lab includes a computerized local                
              weather station and satellite receiving system to take                         
              advantage of low cost, real-time data sources.  Additionally,                  
              a meteorological workstation has dial-up access to a                           
              meteorological database to demonstrate the extensive data and                  
              analysis available.  Students and instructors use the lab's                    
              sources to create daily weather briefings for class.  Live                     
              local weather conditions and satellite imagery are displayed in                
              the Physics Department hall display case to create interest in                 
              weather and science for the general student population.  Topics                
              of atmospheric stability, surface weather map analysis, upper                  
              air analysis, frontal analysis, atmospheric motion,                            
              instrumentation, and radiative energy exchange are taught in                   
              the lab, enhancing the student's understanding of the physical                 
              processes that influence daily weather.
