Abstract    :
              Students of biology must learn the theoretical basis of                        
              molecular biology and also acquire practical experience with                   
              the methods used in this critically important and rapidly                      
              expanding field.  This project will establish an instructional                 
              unit in molecular biology in the Introductory Biology                          
              Laboratory Curriculum at the University of California at Santa                 
              Barbara.  This unit is composed of two three-hour laboratory                   
              exercises, in which students will explore extraction of DNA                    
              from intact cells, restriction endonuclease digestion, the                     
              electrophoretic separation of DNA, and analysis of DNA fragment                
              size, and a one-hour computer-assisted restriction mapping                     
              exercise.
