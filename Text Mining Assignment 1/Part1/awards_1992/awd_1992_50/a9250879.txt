Abstract    :
              A new physical chemistry laboratory course in quantum mechanics                
              and statistical mechanics is using a laser and molecular beam                  
              apparatus to develop an intuitive understanding of concepts                    
              usually presented in the abstract. Experiments performed on                    
              ultracold molecules under the collisionless conditions present                 
              in a molecular beam allows students to more clearly see the                    
              applicability of pertinent models and theories.  More                          
              conventional experiments are pedagogically less effective                      
              because the phenomena of interest are obscured by                              
              intermolecular interactions and the wide range of states                       
              occupied by molecules in the sample.  The new equipment is also                
              be used in an advanced spectroscopy and quantum mechanics                      
              laboratory course.
