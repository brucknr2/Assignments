Abstract    :
              The project is addressing three significant national problems                  
              facing undergraduate physics, chemistry, and calculus: low                     
              student retention rates; limited ability of students to                        
              transfer their knowledge of calculus, chemistry, and physics                   
              among the three disciplines; lack of motivation and excitement                 
              for science and mathematics.  To impact these problems, a                      
              coordinated program for introductory physics, chemistry, and                   
              calculus is being developed around a common set of conceptual                  
              themes, instructional formats, and cognitive and psychomotor                   
              skills.  Extensive use is being made of computers as tools for                 
              data acquisition, analysis, and description; Computer-aided                    
              writing tasks are an integral part of all student activities.
