Abstract    :
              The Department of Natural Science and Mathematics is purchasing                
              a UV/VIS spectrophotometer, a fluorescence spectrophotometer,                  
              and a refrigerated centrifuge including two rotors.  This                      
              equipment markedly improves the department's capacity to teach                 
              the methodological, quantitative, and data analysis                            
              capabilities necessary to understand and practice modern                       
              chemistry and molecular biology.  In addition to providing the                 
              opportunity to pursue more sophisticated and relevant                          
              laboratory exercises in the affected courses, it also offers                   
              the opportunity to establish significant faculty and student                   
              research programs and projects.  Serving a predominantly female                
              student population, Trinity College offers baccalaureate majors                
              in several natural science disciplines, and provides                           
              approximately 10% of the elementary and secondary school                       
              teachers entering the profession in the State of Vermont.
