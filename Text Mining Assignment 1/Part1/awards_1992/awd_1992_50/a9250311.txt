Abstract    :
              Molecular science is a unifying concept for biology, chemistry,                
              and physiological psychology. A molecular science laboratory                   
              for computer assisted three-dimensional imaging of molecular                   
              structure and dynamics to support lecture, laboratory, and                     
              independent study instruction is being established.  Two                       
              dimensional images, whether they be on the printed page or the                 
              blackboard, limit the student to a passive form of learning                    
              that obscures the dynamic nature of the subject; students learn                
              to think of molecules as rigid structures with at most a few                   
              conformations, rather than systems which continually change                    
              according to the conditions of their environments. Making use                  
              of the laboratory and three-dimensional computer-aided                         
              visualization students develop a better understanding of                       
              structures and phenomena at the molecular level.
