Abstract    :
              This project will incorporate physiological instruments, data                  
              acquisition systems, and simulation modeling software in                       
              courses which emphasize whole plant physiology and                             
              environmental biology.  Analytical capabilities will be                        
              enhanced at the advanced levels and in introductory courses.                   
              Exercises will emphasize student directed experiments and will                 
              focus on complex phenomena where experiments will be guided by                 
              simulation models and theory.  Students will interface data                    
              acquisition systems and Macintosh computers with thermocouples,                
              light sensors, hygrometers, and CO2 analyzers as they explore                  
              the mechanistic controls of photosynthesis and obtain                          
              calculated results on line.  A plant stress meter will assist                  
              students to understand the photochemical reactions of                          
              photosynthesis and monitor photosynthetic capabilities under a                 
              variety of conditions.  These complex but realistic exercises                  
              will be interpreted and presented by teams of students.                        
              Ecological studies will be helped by addition of a plant canopy                
              analyzer, a porometer, a water potential system and a Hydrolab                 
              Surveyor 3.  Small group interactions will be fostered.
