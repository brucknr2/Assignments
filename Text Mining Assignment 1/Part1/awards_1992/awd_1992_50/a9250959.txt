Abstract    :
              A recently revised curriculum in Genetics includes a study of                  
              recombinant DNA technology.  The laboratory provides students                  
              with a comprehensive introduction to recombinant DNA technology                
              including relevant computer analysis.  Students gain experience                
              with DNA sequencing, prediction of protein structure,                          
              restriction site analyses, and DNA cloning via computer                        
              simulations before they preform the experiments.  The                          
              simulations are designed to help the student conceptualize                     
              cloning theory and execution.
