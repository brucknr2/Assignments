Abstract    :
              An erasable laser videodisc recorder is being utilized to put                  
              still images and full motion video with soundtracks on                         
              videodiscs.   The high quality visuals that are being developed                
              provide a powerful dimension of speed and realism to                           
              mathematics instruction, transforming classrooms from                          
              information-poor to information-rich environments.  The first                  
              discs produced provide easy-to-use reference and training                      
              materials to support computer laboratory activities and provide                
              support material for the courses for prospective elementary                    
              school teachers.  The equipment will also be used to improve                   
              the training of secondary school teaching candidates and for                   
              inservice work for teachers in area schools.
