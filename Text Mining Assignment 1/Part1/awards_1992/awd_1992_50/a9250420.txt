Abstract    :
              The Biological Computing Laboratory is used by students during                 
              classes, biology laboratories, and undergraduate student                       
              research projects to gather data from physiological                            
              instruments, to manipulate and analyze data, to retrieve                       
              information, to test biomathematical concepts such as                          
              population dynamics and biomechanics, and to prepare                           
              presentation graphics. Equipment includes permanent computer                   
              workstations and a movable station for demonstrations purposes.
