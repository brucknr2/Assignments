Abstract    :
              The project incorporates an Applied Engineering Photonics                      
              Laboratory (AEPL) into the existing curriculum of the                          
              Mechanical Engineering Department. The project uses the                        
              requested equipment to provide hands-on training of                            
              undergraduate students in fundamental optical phenomena and                    
              related engineering applications. The primary equipment for the                
              project is (1) an argon laser, (2) an optical table, (3)                       
              positioning components, (4) light detectors, and (5) optical                   
              components.  The equipment serves several closely related                      
              purposes.  The primary application is in the establishment of                  
              an AEPL course to parallel the existing Principles of Optical                  
              Measurements classroom course. In the  new laboratory                          
              curriculum, undergraduate students have the opportunity of                     
              setting up optical experiments and of performing optical                       
              measurement applications. The equipment will also provide                      
              modern optical instrumentation that will be used to supplement                 
              the existing Mechanical Measurements course as well as                         
              independent laboratory investigations and undergraduate                        
              research that is conducted within the department.
