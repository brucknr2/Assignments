Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                                                                                            
              This project will increase the quantity and quality of                         
              secondary school teachers, especially minority and women                       
              candidates, who aspire to teach in the urban setting.  The                     
              project represents a collaborative activity between Queens                     
              College and the New York Hall of Science and will be                           
              conducted over a two year period.  The objectives of this                      
              program are as follows:  1. increase the pool of candidates                    
              through a program of targeted recruitment; 2. enhance                          
              professional awareness and deepen science content knowledge;                   
              3. and increase educational perspectives and build peer-                       
              support networks.  The retention of the participants in the                    
              program will be enhanced and mentor tutoring.  Professional                    
              awareness and additional content depth will be enhanced by                     
              participant student involvement as student interns at the                      
              New York Hall of Science.  The students will be "paid"                         
              explainers at the museum.
