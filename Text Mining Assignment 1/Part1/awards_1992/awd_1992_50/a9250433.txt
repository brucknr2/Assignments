Abstract    :
              This project will create innovative laboratory experiments                     
              utilizing the theme of amateur radio and satellite signal                      
              reception and processing to help improve undergraduate software                
              engineering instruction.The projects will require the students                 
              to engineer semi-formal requirement specifications,                            
              architectural and detailed designs for systems that predict                    
              amateur satellite locations, control orientation of signal                     
              antennas from a microcomputer, receive, store and decode                       
              amateur satellite telemetry data, and collect and process radio                
              packets of earth snapshots from amateur satellites, using well-                
              accepted principles and techniques of structured                               
              analysis/design and object-oriented analysis/design.The                        
              projects will improve undergraduate software engineering                       
              instruction in that they are not the usual business                            
              applications commonly found in standard textbooks, they                        
              illustrate the rationales behind software engineering                          
              principles and techniques presented in lectures, they will                     
              educate the students in the process of gaining domain knowledge                
              in a field where they were not formally trained and they                       
              provide an enjoyable and challenging environment.
