Abstract    :
              The Department of Chemistry is acquiring a high field fourier                  
              transform nuclear magnetic resonance spectrometer for                          
              undergraduate instruction in an integrated manner from the                     
              lower division through the senior course level.  Eight                         
              lecture/laboratory courses involving majors and non-majors are                 
              being affected by the technology.  Basic 13C and 1H one-                       
              dimensional and two-dimensional (COSY, HETCOR, INADEQUATE) NMR                 
              techniques are introduced in the sophomore Organic Chemistry                   
              course using known natural products and the students progress                  
              to structure elucidation of unknowns in Organic Qualitative                    
              Analysis.  Equilibrium constants and reaction rates are being                  
              measured in Physical Chemistry during the junior year.  At the                 
              senior level students study induction decay in the Molecular                   
              Structure and Reactivity course and multinuclear NMR                           
              spectroscopy in both the Advanced Inorganic Chemistry course                   
              and during participation in Senior Inorganic Chemistry Research                
              Projects.  Inorganic Chemistry focusses on molecular structure                 
              determination of main group and transition metal compounds,                    
              molecular rearrangements, and electronic structure, while                      
              projects in Organic Chemistry involve both the kinetics of                     
              molecular rearrangements of organic compounds and the                          
              structural elucidation of complex bioactive natural products.
