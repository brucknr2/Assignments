Abstract    :
              This project develops an undergraduate course in reactor                       
              concepts utilized in most environmental engineering processes,                 
              and demonstrates these principles using advanced laboratory                    
              methods.  The environmental engineering field is currently                     
              undergoing dramatic increases in the demand for engineers with                 
              the sophistication to design treatment processes and implement                 
              site remediation strategies.  These increases have resulted                    
              from the promulgation of federal standards for the remediation                 
              of contaminated sites and the removal of trace concentrations                  
              of hazardous compounds from water supplies.  Improvements in                   
              environmental engineering education to meet these challenges                   
              has lagged behind the increased sophistication in environmental                
              engineering technology.  The objective of this project is to                   
              provide students with a more diverse environmental engineering                 
              background through the development of the course and its                       
              laboratory component.  Specifically, an Ion Chromatography                     
              System, pH/Ion Selective Electrode Meters and an Atomic                        
              Absorption Spectrophotometer are being incorporated into the                   
              laboratory to address this issue.
