Abstract    :
              The goal of this project is to effectively integrate geographic                
              information systems (GIS) instruction into the environmental                   
              biology curriculum, including required undergraduate research,                 
              at Saint Mary's College of Minnesota.  Laboratories in spatial                 
              and temporal modeling techniques will employ GIS technology                    
              throughout the environmental curriculum, each building on                      
              previous activities.  A new junior-level course in ecological                  
              spatial and temporal analysis and modeling will integrate and                  
              extensively build on earlier topics, and prepare students to                   
              use GIS in their ecological research. This approach to                         
              ecological data analysis is rapidly becoming an essential                      
              component of studies ranging from human ecology to ecosystem                   
              analysis and management.
