Abstract    :
              The aim of the project is to furnish the Behavioral                            
              Neuroscience laboratory, housed within the Department of                       
              Psychology, with high quality light and darkfield microscopy as                
              well as fluorescent options. The new microscopy equipment will                 
              permit students to carry out retrograde labeling of neurons                    
              with various types of probes, and to conduct classical                         
              morphometric studies. Through the use of video cameras, VCR,                   
              framegrabber video board, and editing software, the laboratory                 
              will gain the ability to produce interactive computer programs                 
              combining text with high resolution graphics.  The interactive                 
              programs are used to more effectively demonstrate all lab                      
              activities, including light microscopy, dissections, safety                    
              protocols, and procedures involving live animals.
