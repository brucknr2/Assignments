Abstract    :
              The acquisition of a steady state porometer, portable leaf area                
              meter, portable photosynthesis system, and accessories for                     
              these instruments plus a portable computer will provide the                    
              students with an opportunity to utilize state-of-the-art                       
              instrumentation to measure and analyze growth, productivity,                   
              and photosynthesis data in freshman, junior, and senior                        
              laboratory courses designed to teach plant physiological and                   
              ecological principles as well as enhance undergraduate research                
              projects in the plant sciences.  Experiments are designed so                   
              that students use the new instrumentation to make                              
              transpiration, leaf area, and photosynthetic measurements on a                 
              number of different plants grown under a variety of different                  
              environmental conditions in both the laboratory and field.  In                 
              each experiment the instrumentation will provide a means by                    
              which students can:  (1) formulate and test hypotheses related                 
              to important physiological and ecological concepts; (2) gain                   
              hands-on experience with state-of-the-art equipment; (3)                       
              conduct experimentation which reinforces important                             
              physiological and ecological principles; (4) examine the proper                
              methods of experimental design; (5) gain first-hand experience                 
              in the collection, analysis, and interpretation of scientific                  
              data; and (6) report on the experimentation in a scientific                    
              journal format.
