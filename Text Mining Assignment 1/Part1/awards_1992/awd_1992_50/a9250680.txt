Abstract    :
              The Department of Chemistry is purchasing a diode array                        
              ultraviolet-visible spectrophotometer for use by students in                   
              analytical, organic, inorganic, physical, and biochemistry                     
              classes.  Students perform experiments that range from the                     
              analysis of iron in water, to biochemical assays, to the study                 
              of kinetics of inorganic and organic chemical reactions.  A                    
              flow through cell for a High Performance Liquid Chromatograph                  
              allows for the analysis of complex mixtures such as aspirin -                  
              phenactin -caffeine and mixtures of pinacols.  Research                        
              projects probing detection of biologically active amines,                      
              synthesis of novel heterocycles, and analysis of traditional                   
              Mayan herbal remedies obtained from Yucatan, Mexico, allow                     
              students and faculty to work together on unique projects                       
              involving the new instrument.
