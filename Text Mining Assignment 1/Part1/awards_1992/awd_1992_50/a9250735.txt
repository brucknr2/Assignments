Abstract    :
               A computer laboratory is being developed which will integrate                 
              symbolic, numerical, and graphical tools into the elementary                   
              calculus course in the form of a laboratory-workshop setting.                  
              This approach enables students to explore the fundamental                      
              concepts and applications of calculus in an atmosphere                         
              conducive to peer collaboration. In addition, the upper-                       
              division mathematics modeling course is being restructured to                  
              include Mathematica as a tool for problem solving.
