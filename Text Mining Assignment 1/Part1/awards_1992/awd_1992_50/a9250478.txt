Abstract    :
              A computer laboratory is being developed in an existing                        
              mathematics curriculum that will strengthen the discovery and                  
              exploratory components of various courses by providing power,                  
              flexibility, vividness, and transparency to the general user.                  
              Equipment n the laboratory will permit students in classes to                  
              manipulate and experiment with mathematical concepts both                      
              theoretical and applied.  The goal of the program is to improve                
              the education provided to mathematics students by acquainting                  
              them with the mathematical ideas that are more accessible                      
              through the symbolics, numerics, graphics, and programming                     
              capabilities of computer algebra systems.  Deeper                              
              understanding, retention, and excitement in mathematics is the                 
              goal.
