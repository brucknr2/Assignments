Abstract    :
              The project goals are to improve the retention rate and student                
              attitude in Calculus I and II. The goals are being achieved by                 
              modifying the learning environment. Use of a CAS will provide                  
              students with a tool that combines visualization, symbolic                     
              manipulation, and numeric computing for exploring, verifying,                  
              and discovering mathematical relationships.  The learning                      
              environment is being modified in other ways.  Instead of four                  
              hours of lecture each week, students meet for three hours of                   
              modified lecture and one two-hour laboratory period.  During                   
              the three hours of regular class meeting time, the instructors                 
              incorporate cooperative learning techniques, a modified spiral                 
              approach to topic presentation, and focused writing.  The                      
              combination of a modified learning environment and the use of                  
              a CAS is invigorating the learning process.
