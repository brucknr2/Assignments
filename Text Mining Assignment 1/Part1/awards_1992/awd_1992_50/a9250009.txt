Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This project will be implemented by an organization that has a                 
              ten-year history of preparing students from underrepresented                   
              minority groups for careers in science and engineering.                        
              Specifically, the proposer will work with the National Science                 
              Foundation to initiate eight new Venture school-based projects in              
              Washington, DC.  The Ventures (Macy) program in the selected DC                
              public schools will comprise all core areas of the curriculum:                 
              English, mathematics, science, social studies, and foreign                     
              languages.  Also included are the academic and non-academic                    
              aspects of a comprehensive educational program, including                      
              personal guidance and counseling services, formalized educational              
              experiences that develop cognitive problem-solving and analytical              
              skills, and activities that focus on enhancing independent study.              
                                                                                             
              Support will also be provided to continue faculty development                  
              activities at the original Macy-sponsored schools in Alabama and               
              New York as well as the participating DC schools.  In addition,                
              evaluation studies will be continued for all the sponsored                     
              schools.
