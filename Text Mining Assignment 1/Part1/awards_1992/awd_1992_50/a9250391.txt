Abstract    :
              Gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GC-MS) instrumentation is                
              being used to enhance laboratory experiences both for science                  
              majors and for non-science majors. This is being achieved in                   
              the first case by utilizing GC-MS in an integrated instrumental                
              qualitative analysis protocol for the second-semester freshman                 
              Organic I laboratory.  Subsequently, GC-MS is being employed in                
              semimicroscale-oriented sophomore Organic II laboratory and for                
              establishing a foundation in analytical principles in sophomore                
              Analytical I lecture and laboratory.  Seniors carrying out                     
              undergraduate research are applying GC-MS to problems in                       
              organic, analytical, inorganic, and biochemical projects.  In                  
              the laboratory component of Physical Science and the                           
              Environment, non-science majors are using GC-MS, with purge-                   
              and-trap sample introduction, to address analyses of                           
              environmental water samples.
