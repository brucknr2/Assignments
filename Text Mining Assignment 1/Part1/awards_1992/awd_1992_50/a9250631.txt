Abstract    :
              The Department of Chemistry is purchasing a high pressure                      
              liquid chromatography (HPLC) system with variable wavelength                   
              detection and gradient capabilities for use in a variety of                    
              undergraduate courses.  In the physical chemistry course,                      
              students learn modern HPLC techniques.  In the organic                         
              chemistry, biochemistry and biotechnology courses, students are                
              introduced to separation and purification methods.  Experiments                
              are selected and designed for use with this instrumentation to                 
              demonstrate the capabilities of gradient liquid chromatography                 
              and provide the students with the direct hands-on experience                   
              important to career preparation in this field.
