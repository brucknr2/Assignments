Abstract    :
              A design environment is being developed in which computer                      
              engineering students participate in a year long senior design                  
              sequence integrating material learned and practiced in all                     
              previous courses and laboratories.  Working in groups, students                
              are given the responsibility to design a computer-based device.                
                                                                                             
              Each group designs both the hardware and the software in the C                 
              language, produces a prototype, and writes the documentation.                  
              Emphasis is placed on the software to hardware interface which                 
              includes system software and interrupt routines.  The major                    
              equipment to support this effort are an advanced program                       
              development system, logic analyzers, oscilloscopes, and an                     
              EPROM programmer.
