Abstract    :
              The Project Director is one of the developers in a large-scale                 
              project entitled Consortium for Upper-Level Physics Software                   
              (CUPS).  This Consortium involves 30 faculty members spread                    
              over 27 major degree-granting physics institutions.  The main                  
              goal of the Consortium is to improve the teaching of physics by                
              making more effective use of the power of modern personal                      
              computers.  The Consortium is developing physics simulation                    
              software and accompanying texts which complement material                      
              normally covered in nine upper-level undergraduate physics                     
              courses.  A typical simulation may perform calculations of real                
              physical systems, based on a model, or analysis of real data                   
              from experiments.  The texts describe numerous exercises and                   
              experiments that students can perform with each of the                         
              simulations.  The purchased equipment consists of computers of                 
              sufficient power to run the CUPS software and specialized                      
              projection apparatus needed to demonstrate the CUPS software.                  
              Demonstrations are necessary to acquaint students with the                     
              software.  The remaining computers are being used by students                  
              to carry out projects and exercises based on the CUPS software.                
              The CUPS software must be thoroughly tested at each of the                     
              participating institutions before general release.  The                        
              equipment is essential for the success of this endeavor.
