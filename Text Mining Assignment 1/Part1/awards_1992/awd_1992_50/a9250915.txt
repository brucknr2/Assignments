Abstract    :
              This project involves the purchase of six Silicon Graphics                     
              workstations, a color printer, and related software to                         
              constitute a distributed laboratory for scientific                             
              visualization.  It will be housed in computer laboratories in                  
              the various science buildings with access for all science                      
              students and faculty.  A one-month course on scientific                        
              visualization will be taught for faculty and students during                   
              Winter Term.  The chemistry, computer science, geology and                     
              physics departments plan to enhance existing courses with                      
              modules on visualization.
