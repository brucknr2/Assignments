Abstract    :
              The Environmental Engineering department at Montana College of                 
              Mineral Science and Technology is developing an undergraduate                  
              laboratory where students acquire experience in full-scale                     
              projects which merge design, experimental preparation, field                   
              work, laboratory work, group participation, and data analysis.                 
              The Sulfur Hexafluoride (SF6) Tracer Laboratory improves the                   
              students' understanding of air pollution while providing them                  
              with hands-on project experience.  The equipment in the SF6                    
              Laboratory consists of six subsystems:  a system for releasing                 
              SF6 gas at a controlled, metered rate; samplers for collecting                 
              time-integrated air samples downwind of the source; an SF6                     
              analyzer for continuously monitoring tracer concentrations and                 
              for analyzing the time-integrated air samples; a calibration                   
              system; a meteorological system for measuring the winds and the                
              ambient temperature during field studies; and a portable data                  
              acquisition system for collecting and processing the                           
              meteorological and concentration data.  The equipment is                       
              intended for full-scale experimentation in areas which are                     
              critical to environmental engineering.  As examples, in the SF6                
              Laboratory students can study the transport and diffusion of                   
              air contaminants, develop and apply laboratory skills in a                     
              field setting, study building ventilation requirements, and                    
              test effectiveness of existing ventilation systems.
