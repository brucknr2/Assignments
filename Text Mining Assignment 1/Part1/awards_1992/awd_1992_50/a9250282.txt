Abstract    :
              This project under the Leadership in Laboratory Development                    
              catagory is developing a model for the incorporation of modern,                
              computational analytical chemistry into bachelors programs at                  
              the junior/senior-level.  Examples of how the leading concepts                 
              in analysis, as distinct from measurement, can be taught in                    
              conjunction with measurement are being developed.  Among the                   
              techniques that are being implemented are:  Principal Component                
              Analysis, Target Factor Modeling, Rank Annihilation, and the                   
              use of the SIMPLEX algorithm for non-linear least squares                      
              modelling.
