Abstract    :
              The aim of this project is to develop an intensive hands-on                    
              general biochemistry laboratory in which fundamental subjects                  
              are covered in a thematic fashion from amino acids to proteins                 
              to nucleic acids.  Topics in this "learn by doing" laboratory                  
              are coordinated with the accompanying lecture course to                        
              reinforce subject matter.  Students will work in small groups,                 
              will have a close working relationship with the instructor and                 
              will give informal presentations of their work to their peers.                 
              Not only will this enhance their knowledge of the fundamentals                 
              of biochemistry, but it will also help develop their reasoning                 
              and data interpretation skills as well as their presentation                   
              abilities.  The equipment requested (spectrophotometers,                       
              fluorometer, electrophoresis setups and computers) lend                        
              themselves to such a small group format.
