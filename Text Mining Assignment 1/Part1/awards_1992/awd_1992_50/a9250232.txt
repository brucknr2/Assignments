Abstract    :
              This project will introduce Macintosh IIsi and IIci computers                  
              with relevant software, interfaces, and probes, into all                       
              chemistry laboratory courses at Siena.  First-year students                    
              will use the computers for data acquisition through interfaced                 
              temperature and pH probes and for data analysis through                        
              graphing and spreadsheet programs.  Second-year students will                  
              use the computers for information retrieval (spectra, safety,                  
              physical properties).  Third and fourth year students will use                 
              the computers for molecular modeling, quantum mechanical                       
              calculations, fourier transform analyses, interfacing projects,                
              and independent research projects.
