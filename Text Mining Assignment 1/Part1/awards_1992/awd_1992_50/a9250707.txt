Abstract    :
              Currently, the lack of modern equipment for computerized                       
              stimulus presentation, response measurement and data analysis                  
              seriously hampers the training of students in the sophisticated                
              research methods needed to investigate cognitive processes.                    
              This project will establish a network of seven Macintosh                       
              microcomputers to improve instruction in research methods and                  
              cognitive psychology for undergraduate psychology majors.                      
              Lower-division research methods classes, two upper-division                    
              laboratory courses, an intermediate statistics course, and                     
              individual student research projects will employ the new                       
              equipment.  It is essential that students have adequate                        
              training in this area because of the important role cognitive                  
              psychology plays within the larger field of psychology and in                  
              the rapidly advancing interdisciplinary field known as                         
              cognitive science.
