Abstract    :
              This project provides support for acquisition of image                         
              processing equipment to be used in concurrent signal                           
              processing/controls laboratories.  The control systems                         
              laboratory is well-equipped and well-established while the                     
              undergraduate signal processing laboratory is a relatively new                 
              addition to the department and is currently being redeveloped                  
              to include a number of basic image processing experiments. This                
              award will allow the acquisition of equipment to enable joint                  
              projects for students of both laboratories to work together in                 
              parallel efforts. The purpose of the project, then, is to teach                
              young engineers how to collaborate with engineers with                         
              different specialties, to understand concurrent engineering,                   
              and to work well as a team under these circumstances.
