Abstract    :
              The Department of Chemistry is purchasing a high speed                         
              centrifuge for use by both chemistry and biology students.                     
              Introductory biology students isolate chloroplasts from plant                  
              tissues in order to gain an understanding of biochemical life                  
              processes via study of the Hill reaction.   Biochemistry                       
              students are focussing on enzymology.  For example, they                       
              isolate the enzyme ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase from                      
              spinach leaves preparatory to the investigation of its                         
              catalytic action and inhibition by various substances.  The                    
              equipment is also being used by students undertaking individual                
              research projects.
