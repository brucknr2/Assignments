Abstract    :
              This project develops an enhanced Hazardous Materials Training                 
              Laboratory to provide technical capability and educational                     
              resources for educating Hazardous Materials Technician Students                
              in current one-year certification and two year degree AAS                      
              programs.  These resources upgrade the analytical capability in                
              the general hazardous materials management program and in mixed                
              chemical/nuclear waste characterization, storage, minimization,                
              and disposal.  The enhancements assist in the integration of                   
              the hazardous materials training curriculum with other on-                     
              campus analytical laboratories including chemistry, physics,                   
              engineering technology, computer science, and electronics.                     
              This development expands the practicum, hands-on experience in                 
              operation of hazardous materials field instrumentation, and in                 
              test methods and standards including safety, environmental                     
              remediation, and protection procedures and requirements.
